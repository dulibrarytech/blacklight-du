  <dc:description>While much research has explored the positive correlation between mentoring programs and resulting reduction in teacher attrition, the relationship between mentoring activities and student learning remains equivocal. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between frequency and depth of mentoring activities in which high school teachers in their first three years of teaching report engaging, on the 2011Colorado TELL (Teaching, Empowering, Leading and Learning) Survey, and examining concurrent student achievement growth and shifts in growth gaps as measured by the Colorado Growth Model in those teachers&apos; schools. This mixed methods study also entailed open-ended interviews of five high school teachers in their first three years of teaching regarding their mentoring experiences. Responses were coded and themes were captured to add depth of understanding regarding the dynamics of mentoring of teachers and their students&apos; achievement. As 50% of teacher evaluation in Colorado will be anchored to student academic growth by 2014, the relationship between mentoring and student learning is especially salient for school districts implementing mentoring programs, as well as for teachers who are relying in part on mentoring to help them positively impact student learning.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Despite the enormous risk associated with the development of a large indigenous airliner, China after a failed attempt in the mid-1980s, since 2003 has decided once again to embark on a journey toward the development of a 190 seat commercial airliner.  Nations are typically interested in the development of indigenous airliners because of the potential spillover effects that years of research and development have on the economy and the military. Equally important is that China no longer wants to relinquish its large commercial airplane market to foreign companies such as Boeing and Airbus with their market expected to constitute nearly 25% percent of the world&apos;s demand worth $340 billion.With the aviation industry naturally driven toward a natural monopoly, the Chinese government has agreed to not only subsidize the C919&apos;s development, removing the potential risk associated with launching a technologically advanced aircraft, but upon the aircraft&apos;s arrival, which is expected in 2016, but also guarantee sales of the plane by forcing its State-owned airlines to purchase it. This could potentially be harmful to current commercial aircraft producers Airbus and Boeing. If the three manufacturers: Boeing, Airbus and COMAC split the market in three ways, it will dig deep into the profits of all three manufacturers. This may force Boeing to contract the size of their work force, including skilled engineers and scientists, thus slowing down the process of innovation and product efficiency and the ability of the military and the economy reaping such benefits.This dissertation weaves the work of Peter&apos;s Evans&apos;s &quot;Embedded Autonomy and Michael Porter&apos;s &quot;Determinant Model&quot; to determine that given the current nature of the Chinese state, it possess an adequate level of embedded autonomy to implement favorable policy for constructing an internationally competitive airliner, which consists of both creating an innovative airliner and selling enough of them to develop scale economies.  A state&apos;s institutional configurations whether it possess a high level of autonomy, high level of embeddedness, or a balance between the two, influence the essential society variables in Porter&apos;s Determinant model for developing industry differently.Using a combination of primary source and secondary data from China, the United States and France, which include conducting interviews with key officials and experts in the aviation field from those countries, this research project compares and contrasts the institutional arrangements of China in the 1980&apos;s during its failed attempt at commercial aircraft development with today and concludes that different internal structures lead to different levels of effectiveness and success with respect to implementing policy choices favorable to the development of the commercial aviation industry.Secondly, this Dissertation looks at the potential implications the success of the C919 may have on the United States and Boeing and the ways in which Boeing might prepare to meeting the challenges it faces.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND CHINUA ACHEBE: A STUDY OF CHARACTER AND THE SUPERNATURAL</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This study examines how Shakespeare and Achebe use supernatural devices such as prophecies, dreams, beliefs, divinations and others to create complex characters. Even though these features are indicative of the preponderance of the belief in the supernatural by some people of the Elizabethan, Jacobean and traditional Igbo societies, Shakespeare and Achebe primarily use the supernatural to represent the states of mind of their protagonists.Through an essentially New Historicist approach to the study of character and the supernatural in the tragedies and novels of Shakespeare and Achebe respectively, I argue that both writers, besides using supernatural features to explore the human mind, also indicate how these devices could forewarn the protagonists about certain happenings, as well as being instruments of poetic justice. In a sense, the character of Macbeth, Lear, Okonkwo and Ezeulu, for example, can substantially be appreciated in the ways that these heroes respond to external forces like witches, storms, gods/goddesses and others. Thus, there is exposure, through the supernatural, to traits like ambition, wrath, impulsiveness, pride and others that considerably account for the downfall of the heroes. In fact, Shakespeare&apos;s and Achebe&apos;s preoccupation with the supernatural adds subtlety to their characterization and enhances their readability by situating their art beyond time, place or even particularity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Test accommodations are designed to ensure the comparability of test scores between students and their typically developing counterparts by eliminating as much construct-irrelevant variance and construct-irrelevant difficulty as possible. Although those involved in test creation endeavor to create tests with suitable accommodations for students with disabilities, there is lack of consensus regarding accommodation efficacy. Using meta-analysis and meta-regression to summarize previous research, this study examined whether test accommodations differentially boost test scores of students with disabilities, and whether accommodated conditions provided a more effective and valid assessment of students with disabilities. Results from the meta-analysis of 34 studies (119 effect sizes) lend support to the differential boost hypotheses, whereby students with disabilities (mean effect size  = 0.30, k = 62, p &lt; 0.001) are positively impacted by test accommodations while their typically developing peers (mean effect size = 0.17, k = 57, p &lt; 0.001) gain little from test accommodations.Presentation assessment accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.22, k = 41, p &lt; 0.001) had a small statistically significant impact on the performance of students with disabilities, while use of timing/scheduling accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.47, k = 17, p &lt; 0.001) had a small, bordering on medium, statistically significant impact on these students. The effect for presentation accommodations intensified when narrowing the focus to students with learning disabilities (mean effect size  = 0.36, k = 23, p &lt; 0.001) but not for timing/scheduling accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.48, k = 13, p &lt; 0.001). Overall results for setting (k = 1) and response (k = 3) accommodations were not available as there were too few studies for an overall comparison.The results of meta-regression analyses examining the effects of assessment accommodations on test scores for students with disabilities showed that 42% of the heterogeneity in test score could be explained by an overall model examining population description, test characteristic, results dissemination, and researcher-manipulated (test accommodation effect size for students with disabilities) variables. Population description and test characteristic variable sets explained the greatest amounts of variability for mean increase in test score, R2=0.22 and R2 =0.35 respectively; researcher-manipulated variable (test accommodation) and research dissemination explained little variance, R2 =0.07 and R2 =0.01, respectively.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore principals&apos; perspectives on how they make sense of their leadership roles in a new pay-for-performance system. The study describes the perceptions of six principals, two each from elementary, middle, and high school levels, regarding leadership in a recently changed system. Principals were asked about their leadership roles in implementing a pay-for-performance system, and responses focused on leadership styles, actions, beliefs, preparation, and experience of leading in a time of change. Four themes emerged from the data as significant aspects of leading change in a pay-for-performance system: (a) supporting a culture of excellence, (b) leading through sense making, (c) maintaining balance, and (d) providing instructional leadership.The theme of &quot;culture of excellence&quot; refers to the standpoint of preparing students for higher learning expectations. Participants discussed creating a &quot;high culture of excellence&quot; as setting a sense of urgency for learning. Principals&apos; responses were generally about how to set the stage to prepare students for learning. However, there was an underlying message that leaders must be able to establish a climate for learning by involving people throughout the process. The theme of &quot;leading through sense-making&quot; includes ideas that the leader needs to be able to make sense of a changing system for self and others, understand the significance of the change, and work actively with others as a change agent. The theme of &quot;maintaining balance&quot; describes participants&apos; feelings that money is not the sole motivation factor for teachers in a pay-for-performance system; it is more important to find the right balance of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Maintaining balance includes finding the right staff members, providing the right level of support, and balancing rewards for good teaching. Finally, the theme of &quot;providing instructional leadership&quot; focuses on the principal as a master of instructional practices. All of the participants felt that the most important role as a principal in a pay-for-performance system is to be an active instructional coach for their teaching staff. To foster improvement of teacher performance, the principal needs to provide instructional coaching and feedback, create a team atmosphere, and make regular visits to classrooms to establish a climate focused on improvement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The inequities in learning between the rich and the poor have become pervasive in United States. This is evidenced by the high school graduation rates, college attendance percentages, and employment statistics. Upon another wave of reform, the Common Core State Standards in mathematics are currently being adopted in hopes of increasing learning for all students, with a focus on college and career readiness.   This study is intent on finding ways to remedy the inequities in mathematics between the high income and low income schools by focusing on one of the great glass ceilings to high school graduation and beyond, high school Algebra I.  This study gives examples of how successful teachers are providing opportunities for learning Algebra I despite barriers that students, administrators, and policy-makers deliver in low-income schools amidst the latest reform movement. The researcher provides a portrait of how three different algebra teachers in three different low-income high schools, in the same city in Colorado, teach within the confines of various reform mandates to meet the diverse needs of their students. The research was conducted with a particular focus on the classroom management strategies, student engagement strategies, culturally relevant pedagogy, and caring relationships contributed to the learning in these classrooms. Using observations, teacher interviews, and student interviews, the researcher employs the method of Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship to answer the research question. The question that guided this study was: What practices do effective algebra teachers employ in high poverty, diverse high school algebra classrooms to implement the curriculum and influence student learning? This question was supported by the sub-questions: (a) What classroom management strategies contribute to student learning?; (b) Which teaching strategies contribute to student engagement?; (c) Which culturally relevant pedagogy practices contribute to students&apos; opportunity to learn?; (d) How do relationships in the classroom support students&apos; opportunities to learn?; and (e) How are classroom management strategies, engagement strategies, culturally relevant pedagogy, and caring relationships intertwined in classrooms today? The findings of this study provide a stark warning to overly prescribed curricula and pedagogy, along with the heightened use of standardized tests tied to teacher evaluation. Answering the primary question using Eisner&apos;s (1998) dimensions of schooling and Uhrmacher&apos;s administrative dimension, paints a bleak picture for low-income schools under the current movement for accountability using student test scores. The negative consequences of a punitive administrative oversight on the teaching and learning of students paints a depressing scene for low-income schools. Conversely, the efforts of teachers to provide classroom management and student engagement supported by culturally relevant practices and caring relationships give a picture of hope if we focus on supporting and keeping in the schools that need them the most.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Multiple incidents of postsecondary school shooting violence have occurred in American society--prompting concern about safety on college campuses, administrators&apos; roles in prevention, and proactive and responsible bystander actions.  Active shooter plans have become more established in educational environments, with efforts are directed toward both the perpetrator and the victims.  Limited information, however, has been provided regarding how bystanders would, or even should, construe and characterize their roles in such incidents.  Numerous professional and governmental researchers in organizations throughout the United States (e.g., the Center for Disease Control Injury Center, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, National Consortium on Violence Research-Carnegie Mellon University, and the Violence Prevention Research Program-University of California, Davis) have identified that prevention remains the best action.  The American Colleges Health Association (ACHA) leaders asked postsecondary educational institutions&apos; leaders to become engaged more actively in prevention efforts. In the current study, the researcher&apos;s own reconditioned hermeneutic design was used to examine appropriate bystander action during an incident of school shooting violence based on an Adapted Social Systems Model.  Internal and external socioeconomic factors with influence on student bystander action were addressed.  School administrators might find insight from the findings, implications, and future directions for research as discussed.  The results include a framework for the development of the ARISE bystander action model, a school violence ecological model in which the student bystander is placed in the center.  The ARISE model might be used as an action strategy for postsecondary institutions with a multidisciplinary approach to informing new policies and procedures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation is the result of a series of studies involving hot press lamination of inverted organic photovoltaics.  It first gives background and develops a lamination process for fabrication.  Then, the process is used to answer fundamental questions about organic photovoltaics and to fabricate previously impossible or overly complicated devices.  Finally, the author examines the scientific theory which describes the process and aligns that theory with related measurements.The field of organic photovoltaics is introduced and the lamination process is developed and optimized.  In the lamination process, part of the solar cell is deposited onto a rigid substrate, and the rest is deposited onto a flexible one.  The two substrates are pressed together under heat to complete the device.  Laminated devices are shown to perform as well or better than those made with standard fabrication methods, and the process shows benefits to both large scale production and scientific exploration of OPV devices.The lamination process is then used to answer physical questions and solve problems related to OPV.  After diversifying the procedure to include lamination at either the electron or hole contact, a series of semitransparent electrode materials are integrated into devices.  These materials are difficult or impossible to integrate into inverted devices without lamination.  Then bare metal contacts are pretreated and laminated into devices in order to investigate the mechanisms for time evolution in inverted devices.  Finally, two active layers are laminated to make a tandem device.  It is shown that the performance of the tandem is limited not by the procedure, but by the materials used in the interconnect layer between the two subcells.An investigation is performed that explores the physics behind the basis of lamination: adhesion.  Different mechanisms of adhesion are proposed, and calculations of adhesion forces based on known materials properties are made.  The resulting range of calculated forces is quite large, but within the range of measured values for adhesion force.  A general picture of the physics involved in lamination processes and their adhesion forces emerges.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the relationships between three important cultural factors—acculturation, self-disclosure, and gender— and Korean American adolescents’ attitudes and expectations about group counseling. In addition, the relationships between two of these factors−acculturation and self-disclosure, and Korean parents’ expectations and attitudes about group counseling as a potential treatment modality for their adolescents were examined. Ninety-three Korean high school students who attended 9 private afterschool programs provided by the Korean Institute of Southern California (KISC) in the Los Angeles area and their 93 corresponding Korean parents participated in the present study. For the student sample, the four subscales of the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (Integration, Assimilation, Separation, and Marginalization), the Self-Disclosure Questionnaire, and gender served as predictor variables, and the Group Therapy Survey was used as an outcome variable. The multiple regression results indicated that integration and assimilation significantly contributed to the prediction of Korean adolescents’ attitudes and expectations about group counseling, with the integration being the strongest predictor of the other modes of acculturation. Results also indicated that integration was correlated with Korean adolescents’ positive attitudes and expectations about group counseling, whereas assimilation was correlated with their negative attitudes and expectations about group counseling. The level of
iii
comfort with self-disclosure and gender were not significant predictors of group counseling expectations among the Korean adolescents. For the parent sample, five predictor variables (the four modes of acculturation and self-disclosure) were entered into another multiple regression model to investigate the impact of these variables on Korean parents’ expectations about group counseling for their adolescents. The results indicated that integration and self-disclosure were significant predictors of the parents’ expectations about group counseling. Implications and limitations of the present study, and directions for future research are discussed. Additionally, some recommendations for school counselors who work with Korean students and their families are presented in Chapter 5.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Pilot Study Exploring the Educational and Social/Emotional Benefits of Web-based Groups for Parents of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Research has indicated that parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) experience more feelings of isolation, depression and stress than those of children with other disorders including ADHD and Down Syndrome.  While these feelings are especially elevated in parents living in rural communities who may have limited access to services, they are also present in those living in urban areas but are restricted due to challenges with childcare, transportation, finances and time.  Furthermore, research posits that services for parents of the newly diagnosed or of younger children are abundant while services and education for parents of adolescents are hard to access regardless of location. This study explored the use of technology as a viable option for providing education and emotional support to parents of adolescents with ASDs and may assist in guiding future studies of this nature.  Group sessions were facilitated remotely using video-conference technology and covered the topics of stress reduction, IEP&apos;s, puberty, and the transition to adulthood.  This study employed a mixed methods design that utilized a concurrent triangulation approach. Within this approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently and then compared to determine if there was convergence, differences, or some combination. The quantitative tools included, first, the Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA) which was used to measure any change in stress levels that occurred throughout the treatment.  Pretest/posttest measures were then used to measure knowledge acquisition. The data gathered from these tools were then analyzed using a t test for paired samples. The qualitative phase employed a questionnaire that obtained anecdotal information regarding participants&apos; experiences with and preferences towards parent groups; their feelings of depression, isolation, stress related to parenting a child with ASD; their confidence regarding the topics of stress reduction, IEP&apos;s, puberty, and the transition to adulthood; and their experiences within the web-based group setting. This qualitative information was used to look for themes to begin to understand how parents of adolescents with ASD may benefit from groups provided using Internet technology.

  <dc:title>Aging and Technology Perspectives of Web-Based Chronic Disease Self-Management</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Many people suffer from chronic disease; however, older adults are at greatest risk of chronic conditions. Although social workers regularly engage with chronically ill older adults, they are not noticeably involved with the research and development of chronic disease management. As such, with recent movements toward health information technology, the efficacy of technology-based chronic disease management is not well established for older adults. Informed by theories of self-management, human development, and technology design, this research investigated lifespan differences of web-based chronic disease self-management. Using a sequential mixed methods design, a secondary data analysis of a diabetes specific web-based self-management intervention (n=462) was performed, followed by qualitative focus groups with 40 older intervention participants, and then mixed for overall interpretation. Results indicated that social workers must take a leadership role in the evaluation and implementation of web-based self-management for older adults to address identified lifespan differences.

  <dc:title>An Assessment of Character and Leadership Development Latent Factor Structures through Confirmatory Factor, Item Response Theory, and Latent Class Analyses</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study leveraged the complementary nature of confirmatory factor (CFA), item response theory (IRT), and latent class (LCA) analyses to strengthen the rigor and sophistication of evaluation of two new measures of the Air Force Academy&apos;s &quot;leader of character&quot; definition--the Character Mosaic Virtues (CMV) and the Leadership Mosaic Inventory (LMI).  Special CFA methods involving robust weighted least squares estimation were implemented to analyze the rated responses through linear structural equation modeling.  Most informative at the subscale level, the CFA techniques provided evidence of factorial validity and other desirable psychometric properties in support of previous exploratory results for a nine-factor CMV and a unidimensional LMI.  As an alternative to CFA, IRT&apos;s nonlinear approach and capability of estimating the probability of a response based on the amount of a latent trait was applied to the CMV and LMI data.  Most informative at the item level, individual item difficulty parameters were estimated as the amount of the latent trait required for a cadet to give a particular response to an item and mapped against person ability estimates.  The IRT analyses were extended to explore the underlying dimensions of the CMV and LMI through multidimensional IRT (MIRT)--results supporting the theoretical dimensional structure of the CMV were substantiated while new evidence of a multidimensional LMI structure was concluded.  LCA techniques permitted the inference of classifying mixtures of unobserved cadet subpopulations based on their responses to the CMV and LMI.  The analyses uncovered the meaning and number of underlying subpopulations not evident through the other two traditional factor structure analysis techniques.  The creation of the study&apos;s latent class models complemented the more traditional dimensional approaches of structure assessment with an understanding of the unobserved cadet subpopulations which could lead to future targeted cadet developmental opportunities being applied at organizational levels or groups deficient in certain latent traits.  By exposing more researchers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders to these three advanced psychometric evaluation methods, this study benefited the fields of moral development and leadership development, especially at the nation&apos;s service academies.

  <dc:title>Disrupting Privilege: A High School Curriculum</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Current privilege pedagogy scholarship demonstrates the importance of understanding privilege as an entryway into critical studies and everyday community engagement. Thus, this dissertation argues that privilege must be introduced into education earlier, such as high school. In order to demonstrate ethical possibilities of meeting the need for care, this project integrates social work and critical pedagogy scholarship that explores teaching privilege in the classroom, with culture and communication scholarship. This dissertation connects culture and communication, critical pedagogy, and performance to demonstrate an applied use of communication scholarship in two classroom settings to explore dialogues of privilege through a curriculum titled &quot;Disrupting Privilege.&quot; To do this, this dissertation uses critical pedagogy as a method of teaching &quot;Disrupting Privilege&quot; in the two classrooms and narrative ethnography as a method of analysis of what happened communicatively and performatively in the classrooms. The use of narrative ethnography forefronts student voices to guide the analysis of this dissertation. 
      In &quot;Disrupting Privilege,&quot; an analysis of communication components shows how communication was used to structure and facilitate critical conversations of privilege in the classroom. This structure and facilitation of communication created a space where emotion was brought into the classroom through privilege, pedagogy, and performance. By looking at the communicative and emotional aspects of these two classrooms we see demonstrations of classroom change and transformation. Therefore, this dissertation sets an example of how the use of communication and emotion, as seen in the  &quot;Disrupting Privilege&quot; curriculum, can be used in high school to transform individuals and communities by analyzing what happened in each of these classrooms. The hope is that, through these narratives, student voices and experiences become a way to understand the capacity for high school students to struggle through critical conversations and performances about privilege. Involving high school students more often in these conversations, can teach students to think critically and engage in disrupting systems of power and, in return, potentially transform communities as well as pave the way for deeper, more sophisticated conversations in college.

  <dc:title>Rethinking the Adventure Education Experience: An Inquiry of Meanings, Culture and Educational Virtue</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study is an investigation of the adventure education (AE) experience with particular attention to what happens during the AE experience, the meanings participants ascribe to the experience, how personal backgrounds and institutional cultures coalesce in AE, and the significance of the AE experience for schooling. These topics are explored through observing and interviewing participants of adventure education programs under the qualitative framework of educational connoisseurship and criticism. The experiences at the three sites of study--an outdoor challenge course, a wilderness backpacking expedition and a summer adventure program--are described in detail and illustrated through the qualities of the experience (celebratory challenge, novelty, freedom and togetherness, aesthetic vitality, and great experience), cultural coalescence in AE (depicted through cultural rigidity and flexibility), and the participant perceptions of schooling. Findings are inferred through recommendations for AE, including consideration of the qualities of experience, striking a cultural balance in AE, and embodying a shift in thinking regarding the purpose of the AE experience. This study also provokes a reconsideration of contemporary educational paradigms, as the participant perceptions of schooling, when considered alongside the AE experience, provide a fresh perspective of the qualities of educational experience.

  <dc:title>Authenticity in Education: Theory Into Practice</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study investigates the role of authenticity in education. By applying Fred Newmann&apos;s theoretical framework of authentic achievement to a specific, K-12 setting operating in the real world, I examined Newmann&apos;s five facets of authentic education and looked for their practical manifestations. Those facets are higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connectedness to the world beyond the classroom, substantive conversation, and social support for student achievement. Parker Palmer inspired the addition of the criteria of the spiritual/ineffable to the framework, which is also examined in relation to authentic pedagogy. Combined, these qualities are referred to as the authentic education framework (AEF). Qualitative data from The Spring School (pseudonym) on the east coast of the United States has been collected and analyzed through the lens of educational connoisseurship and criticism. This research method permits the researcher to provide thick description, interpretation, and evaluation and to draw on themes presented in the data analysis. Qualitative methods of data collection including interview, observation, and artifact review were corroborated. Because the administration of the school changed during the data analysis phase and no longer operates under the philosophy under which this study occurred, this paper has become an historical narrative.
      	The findings that emerged reveal that the following factors aid in the realization of authentic pedagogy at the elementary-school level: (1) school trust, (2) opportunities for aesthetic transformative experiences, (3) works toward a greater good, and (4) the role of the community. The notions of sincerity, honesty, relevance and wholisitic teaching in the school context were also evident.  Findings also underscore the importance of a well-developed and thoroughly considered school philosophy. This study confirms that the processes of teaching and learning are personal in nature and relative to context and that prescribed curricula and confining pedagogical methods are antithetical to the development of opportunities for authentic teaching and learning.

  <dc:title>Study the Carrier Frequecny Offset (CFO) for wireless OFDM</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Due to high proficiency with high bandwidth efficiency, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been selected for broadband wireless communication systems. Since OFDM can provide large data rates with sufficient robustness to radio channel impairments, and due to its robustness against the multipath delay spread, OFDM has always been a designated technique for broadband wireless communication mobile systems. Nevertheless, OFDM suffers from Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO). CFO has been recognized as a major disadvantage of OFDM. CFO can lead to the frequency mismatch in transmitter and receiver oscillator. Lack of the synchronization of the local oscillator signal (L.OSC), for down conversion in the receiver with the carrier signal contained in the received signal, can cause the performance of OFDM to degrade. In other words, the orthogonality of the OFDM relies on the condition that the transmitter and receiver operate with exactly the same frequency reference. If this is not the case, the perfect orthogonality of the subcarrier will be lost, which can result in CFO. In this research, the source of creating CFO and the major CFO estimation algorithms have been reviewed and discussed in literature. We then proposed some algorithms and techniques for estimating and compensating for the effect of CFO. We showed that our proposed methods have a better performance with low complexity.

  <dc:title>Novel functions for neuronal RNA processing bodies in the control of axon terminal growth in Drosophila melanogaster</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      In this thesis we first characterized neuronal functions for HPat/Pat1, a core component of RNA processing bodies or &quot;P bodies&quot;. We show that hpat mutants exhibit a strong synaptic hyperplasia at the developing and acutely stimulated Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The synaptic defects observed in hpat mutants are associated with rearrangement of the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton suggesting that HPat negatively regulates presynaptic microtubule-based growth during NMJ development. Interestingly, we also found that both pre-and postsynaptic HPat expression controlled rapid axon terminal growth in response to acute spaced synaptic stimulation. We also demonstrate that HPat interacts genetically with the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase complex (twin/CCR4) and the miRNA pathway (Argonaute 1) to control bouton formation. We propose that HPat is required to target mRNAs involved in the control of microtubule architecture and synaptic terminal growth for repression, presumably in P bodies, via both general and miRNA-mediated mechanisms. 
             Next, we investigated whether HPat interacts with the Drosophila Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (dFMR1), to regulate neuronal structure in a Drosophila melanogaster fragile X model. First, we demonstrated that HPat interacts biochemically with dFMRP in an RNAse independent manner. Second, we show that HPat genetically interacts with dFmr1 in the Drosophila eye although the phenotype is weak, however we did not see any interaction of hpat and dfmr1 to control synaptic structure at the NMJ. Finally, we screened additional P body components that might have function in FMRP mediated translation regulation. Interestingly, a luciferase-based translational repression tethering assays in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells showed the function of GW182 in FMRP-mediated translation regulation.

  <dc:title>Assessment of the Performance of a Resilient Hybrid Political System: The Case of Malaysia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Countries that come out of the &quot;gray zone&quot; during &quot;third wave democratization,&quot;  as ambiguous as they may seem politically, may not be a manifestation of a failed democratization attempt. Rather, their &quot;hybrid&quot; characteristics, portraying neither a full democracy nor outright authoritarian practices entrenched in the system, may plausibly serve as a panacea to governing, especially in a troubled state.
      Many studies that have depicted the &quot;hybrid&quot; political system have focused more on its conceptualization and typology rather than how this kind of regime actually performs and functions. However, studying this regime type only at its surface does not help us to understand the in-depth nature of a hybrid regime nor its political setup. A thorough assessment is needed for this purpose. Therefore, this case study evaluates the performance of the hybrid political system that is practiced in Malaysia.
      This study assesses the two democratic principles of popular control and political equality, using the assessment framework prepared by the internationally based intergovernmental organization, the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), whose aim is to support sustainable democracy around the world. The method prepared by International IDEA was based on the claim that &quot;democracy is not an all-or-nothing affair&quot; but is a shifting continuum. The IDEA method acknowledges that the democracy practiced in some countries is not perfect and is subject to the country&apos;s historical experiences, demographics, cultures, and realities.
      This study&apos;s results suggest that having partially practiced democratic principles, with support from semi-authoritarian apparatus, produces a political system with both positive and negative components that both facilitate regime transition and democratization as well as reinforce regime incumbency and dampen democratization. This study shows that, ultimately, the interactions between the positive and negative components may produce balancing mechanisms that help to strengthen both the regime&apos;s persistence and the country&apos;s resilience.

  <dc:title>Hope&apos;s Voice: Listening to Urban Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For several decades, there has been a large gap between the achievement scores of urban youth of color and their white counterparts. This achievement gap persists despite the efforts of educators and policymakers to close it. This descriptive study examined the perceptions of urban youth of color regarding their role in school and the support and barriers they encountered related to academic achievement in school. 
      Duncan-Andrade (2009) compares schooling in underserved communities to growing roses in concrete. He argues that the conditions of life for urban youth of color are in themselves oppositional forces. He writes that hope is required urban youth face such forces. Hope is composed of three parts: goals, pathways, and agency (McDermott, 2002; Snyder, 2003).  
      This study examined the goals, pathways, and agency for urban youth of color and their perception of what schools are doing to support them.  Through the use of focus groups and surveys in two high schools in the Denver metropolitan region of Colorado, students&apos; stories were collected. These groups were facilitated by student leaders from Urban Youth Ambassadors. 
      Major findings in this study include that students identified a greater number of barriers to engagement than they identified sources of support. All three sources of support (teacher/student relationships, family influence, and teacher quality) were also potential barriers to engagement according to the students. School climate and limiting mental models were the other two barriers to engagement. The teacher was central in two of the support and barrier themes: Teacher/Student Relationship Quality (TSRQ) and Teaching Quality (TQ).The teacher&apos;s ability to develop a strong, productive relationship with the students can be the factor that changes a student&apos;s experience and success. The students articulated hope through relationships and displayed evidence of personal resilience toward accomplishing goals. The goal orientation that emerged in this study was more about relationships and the people in student&apos;s lives than it was about academic achievement or the standardized testing.

  <dc:title>A Mixed Methods Examination of Structural Bigenderism and the Consequences for Transgender and Gender Variant People</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For years, transgender activists and their allies have spoken out about the oppression that transgender and gender non-conforming people experience in relation to societal systems and institutions, due to policies and practices that do not acknowledge non-binary experiences of gender, that do not recognize that one&apos;s gender may change over time or may not match cultural expectations for gender expression, and that punish and discriminate against trans people (Gilbert, 2009; Lombardi &amp; Davis, 2006; Markman, 2011; Spade, 2006; WWRC, 2010). Scholars have called for human services professionals and researchers to critique the failures of institutions in society (and the people within them) that continue to reproduce oppressive patterns related to gender (Davis, 2008; Markman, 2011; Spade, 2006; Wilchins, 2004). This dissertation examines the topic of structural bigenderism, using a mixed methods analysis of data based on the lives of transgender and gender non-conforming people in two settings of interest to social workers--social welfare settings and higher education.
      This study analyzes secondary data from two community-based projects: a qualitative participatory research project in Colorado of 30 transgender people&apos;s experiences in higher education, and a national survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force of transgender people&apos;s experiences of discrimination across a variety of settings (Grant et al., 2011). Qualitative themes provide detail about problematic institutional practices, interactions with people who embody the power of the institution, and suggestions for improving higher education settings. Quantitative findings (with sample sizes ranging from &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 296 to &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 3,480, depending on the model) indicate a general pattern that transgender people who held multiple marginalized identities were at greatest risk of unequal treatment in social welfare settings, being denied access to or thrown out of homeless shelters, being denied financial aid or scholarships, being denied access to gender-appropriate spaces at school, and being prohibited from changing their student records to reflect their gender. Joint data displays explore the role of intersectionality in transgender people&apos;s experiences in higher education. The study concludes with a discussion of implications for social work practitioners and educators.

  <dc:title>Mimicry, Mirroring, Subversion, and Critique: Reading Heterotopia in the Cubicula of the Sacraments</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation examines the spaces commonly called the Cubicula of the Sacraments, five rooms in the Callistus Catacomb in Rome, in light of Michel Foucault&apos;s concept of heterotopia. I argue that the Christian communities that created the Cubicula constructed their spaces and construed the symbolic worlds they conjured there as a way of mimicking, mirroring, subverting, and critiquing the &quot;other&quot; spaces and cultures that surrounded them. 
      This work takes place along four lines of inquiry. The first of these is space and place, and uses Foucault&apos;s and Henri Lefebvre&apos;s notions of heterotopia to describe the Callistus Catacomb&apos;s location in the Roman landscape--its relationship to other spaces, structures, and ideas. The second is art; the rich decorations in the Cubicula provide opportunity to think about the communities&apos; creative use of new and traditional iconography to construct a uniquely Christian world-view in art. The third is texts. Much of the art in the Cubicula is drawn from or connected to textual sources, and examination of those texts reveals selections and interpretations that tend toward spatial readings and meanings. The fourth is practices; the Cubicula of the Sacraments contain references to practices such as baptism and meals, and served as locations for practices such as funerals and pilgrimage--all serving to underscore and enhance the heterotopian nature of the spaces. 
      Together, the evidence of space and place, art, texts, and practices, when viewed through Foucault&apos;s work, reveal that the Cubicula of the Sacraments were heterotopias, or &quot;other spaces,&quot; within the Roman landscape. These were spaces of contestation, expression, and the formation of communal identity--venues for the construal of Christianity and its place in the world, and meticulously constructed microcosms of the world as they thought it ought to be. 
      This dissertation, then, provides a holistic, theoretically grounded view of catacomb spaces, and demonstrates the usefulness of approaches that combine various types of evidence available in the catacombs to &quot;read&quot; them as wholes. It also illuminates Christian construals of themselves and the Roman Empire in the period before Constantine, shedding light on the development of Christian traditions.

  <dc:title>Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment: Does Family Systems Therapy Improve Family Functioning and Decrease Drug Use?</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Family systems therapy is a way of working with individuals, couples, families, or a group of people that emphasizes relationships and a person&apos;s/family&apos;s greater &quot;system&quot; as important factors in establishing change and health (Haley, 1976; Minuchin, 1974).  Treating adolescent substance abuse with family systems therapy has been demonstrated in the literature as being an effective method of intervention (Coatsworth, Santisteban, McBride, &amp; Szapocznik, 2001; Kumfer &amp; Alvarado, 2003; Leichtling, Gabriel, Lewis &amp; Vander Ley, 2006; Liddle, 2002; Liddle et al., 2001; Rowe &amp; Liddle, 2003), as the various ecological and epidemiological factors associated with adolescent substance abuse can be addressed effectively with family systems work (Cunningham &amp; Henggler, 1999; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 1979; Liddle et al., 2001; Szapocznik &amp; Williams, 2000).  The dissertation used a sample of 71 families who participated in a family systems therapy intensive outpatient substance abuse program in the greater metro-Denver area from 2006 to mid-2008.  The youth, aged 13-17 years old, tended to be highly involved with substance abuse, were not motivated to change, and were not interested in participating in treatment.  A three-month follow-up survey was evaluated and demonstrated that both youth and parents/guardians found that that family systems therapy was effective in increasing the family&apos;s functioning, decreasing the youth&apos;s substance use, increasing the youth&apos;s school performance, and decreasing the youth&apos;s court involvement.

  <dc:title>Editorial Collaboration and Control: Laura Riding and the Seizen Press Years</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      With the founding of Seizin Press in 1927, Laura Riding began a new epoch in her career as poet and literary theorist.  Along with her partner, Robert Graves, Riding worked among and with important literary tastemakers of the Modernist era, such as Gertrude Stein, Len Lye and James Reeves.  Riding&apos;s demanding and intense editorial and collaborative style resulted in some unique and fascinating works, such as the bizarrely beautiful &lt;italic&gt;Life of the Dead&lt;/italic&gt; and the egomaniacal &lt;italic&gt;The World and Ourselves&lt;/italic&gt;. Beyond close literary examination of the above works, this study looks at the pressures both within the Seizin Press community and without--such as the demands of new publishing standards on small presses, and the intrusion of the Spanish Civil War. Ultimately, the control Riding exerted on both her own work and the works of those around her reflected more than the hysterical micro-managing of which she and so many other women editors were accused.  Instead, her obsessive desire to control every word written by her collaborators and clients spoke to her radical view of language as not only stable, but the only link with ultimate truth.  Authors, especially poets, became more and more suspect as purveyors of lies in Riding&apos;s point of view.  During her years at the press, Riding&apos;s understanding of the poet&apos;s role in society shifted from one akin to priest into one akin to charlatan.  For Riding scholars, it is especially important that we consider the impact of Riding&apos;s years at Seizin Press in her infamous disavowal of poetry in 1941.  This study therefore works to place in conversation Riding&apos;s years at Seizin with her language theories and, in turn, explore the way such theories defined Riding&apos;s reality through her work at the press.

  <dc:title>Applying a Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding and Evaluating the Effects of Family Treatment among Sexually Abusive Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Families are frequently identified as a risk for supporting and perpetuating sexually abusive behavior among youth. Traditionally, the field has focused on deficits of families rather than considering them as a resource to promote change. Although emerging literature strongly argues the need to target families in the healing process, treatment initiatives rarely follow suite, and research has failed to comprehensively document the effectiveness of family-inclusive treatment. Knowing there are several gaps in literature, the current study was conducted to investigate the process of engagement in treatment, understand the nuances of family treatment, and to uncover positive outcomes associated with family involvement. An embedded mixed methods design was carried out in collaboration with the Colorado Sex Offender Management Board. Quantitative data were collected from probation files of adjudicated youth (N = 85) in three different Colorado jurisdictions, and qualitative data were collected from approved Colorado treatment providers (N = 19). Rigorous data analyses techniques were employed, including a qualitative Grounded Theory approach using structural, values, and focused coding schemas to analyze qualitative data and logistic regression models to analyze quantitative data. Qualitative results reveled the high level of stress among families and underscored the therapeutic relationship and treatment components as reciprocal provisions of treatment, whereby one is contingent upon the other for ethical service delivery. Quantitative logistic regression models demonstrated that youth with greater family service involvement (measured on a continuous scale composed of constructs of family therapy, multi-family group, family multi-disciplinary team, informed supervision, and family reunification) were three times more likely to successfully complete treatment than those who did not receive any family services. A conceptual model emerged that revealed strategies to move families through the treatment process. Inherent implications suggest that: crisis prevention initiatives are important to avert high levels of family stress; current treatment frameworks should be revised to include family protective factors; critical mechanisms of change should be tested quantitatively; and family services should occur uniformly. Overall, future research steps should detail a manual for how to pragmatically move families through the treatment process, test the effectiveness of that manual, and then disseminate effective methods to the provider community.

  <dc:title>Human Action Recognition Via Fused Kinematic Structure and Surface Representation</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Human action recognition from visual data has remained a challenging problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. This dissertation introduces a new methodology for human action recognition using motion features extracted from kinematic structure, and shape features extracted from surface representation of human
      body. Motion features are used to provide sufficient information about human movement, whereas shape features are used to describe the structure of silhouette. These features are fused at the kernel level  using Multikernel Learning (MKL) technique to enhance the overall performance of human action recognition. In fact, there are advantages in using multiple types of features for human action recognition,  especially, if the features are complementary to each other (e.g. kinematic/motion features and shape features). For instance, challenging problems such as inter-class similarity among actions and performance variation, which cannot be resolved easily by using a single type of feature, can be handled by fusing multiple types of features.
      This dissertation presents a new method for representing the human body surface provided by depth map (3-D) using spherical harmonics representation. The advantage of using the spherical harmonics representation is to represent the whole body surface into a nite series of spherical harmonics coefficients. Furthermore, these series can be used to describe the pose of the body using the phase information encoded inside the coefficients. Another method for detecting/tracking distal limb segments using the kinematic structure is developed. The advantage of using the distal limb segments is to extract discriminative features that can provide sufficient  and compact information to recognize human actions. Our experimental results show that the aforementioned methods for human action description are complementary to each other. Hence, combining both features can enhance the robustness of action recognition. In this context, a framework to fuse multiple features using MKL technique is developed. The experimental results show that this framework is promising in incorporating multiple features in different domain for automated recognition of human actions

  <dc:title>Thermal and Electrical Transport in Ferromagnetic Metal Thin Films</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The recent emergence of spin caloritronics has focused considerable attention on the interplay between spin, charge, and temperature gradients in magnetic materials.  A reliable and energy efficient method for generating pure spin currents would signify an important step toward future spin-based nano-electronics that may offer lower power consumption and greater processing capabilities.  To develop new technology using thermoelectric effects in magnetic thin films, it is essential to understand thermal and electrical transport through these films. One possible source of pure spin currents is the so-called spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in which a thermal gradient applied to a ferromagnet is thought to produce a pure spin current detectable by measuring a transverse voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) generated by the inverse spin Hall effect.  However, recent work on spin-dependent transport in thin film nanostructures supported by bulk substrates has underscored the difficulty in understanding thermal gradients in these systems due to uncertainty in the direction of the applied thermal gradient through a substrate with a thermal conductance several orders of magnitude larger than the sample conductance.  These results suggest that early SSE experiments may have been strongly affected by other effects such as the anomalous Nernst effect.  They may also have been affected by thermoelectric effects generated from planar thermal gradients such as the planar Nernst effect which develops a V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; in a film with a planar thermal gradient and magnetization.  
      In this dissertation, I introduce the concepts of thermal conductivity, the Wiedemann-Franz law, and thermoelectric effects including the Seebeck effect, the Peltier effect, and the planar Nernst effect (PNE).  Next, I describe our experimental method for measuring thermal and electrical transport in non magnetic and ferromagnetic metallic thin films using suspended Si-N membrane structures.  Our membrane method reduces the background thermal conductance contribution by 5 orders of magnitude when compared with similar experiments conducted on thin films supported by bulk substrates.  This confinement to the plane of the platform and film ensures a thermal gradient in the x- or y-direction only.  The experiment therefore enables exploration of thermoelectric effects in a  completely 2-D configuration.  Next, I present results of several experiments probing thermal conductivity and the Lorenz number in thin films.  Both the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity of metallic thin films is lower that bulk values from literature.  The deviation of the Lorenz number from the theoretically predicted Sommerfeld value in all films indicates imbalances between the heat and charge currents in the films from scattering or additional thermal conductivity contributions from magnons and phonons.   I also present results from experiments measuring the Seebeck effect or thermopower, and anisotropic magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic thin films.  In these films, the thermopower scales with resistance as predicted by the Mott equation, and the magnetic field dependence of the thermopower results from the same spin-dependent scattering responsible for the AMR.  I present the first results from experiments designed to probe the PNE and related effects such as the SSE in ferromagnetic thin films.   The results share features previously attributed to the SSE such as linear delta T dependence and sign reversal on hot and cold sides of the sample, however, the voltage generated transverse to the applied thermal gradient is always even in applied field due to spin-dependent scattering.  The data display a sin&amp;theta;cos&amp;theta; angular dependence predicted by the PNE rather than the cos&amp;theta; angular dependence expected from the SSE.  In these experiments, we observe no evidence of a thermally generated spin current, and the upper limit on the SSE coefficient in our experiment is 15-30 times smaller than previously reported by experiments conducted using bulk substrates.  Finally, I present first results from experiments designed to measure the Peltier effect in thin films and test the interdependence between the Peltier and Seebeck effects predicted by Onsager reciprocal relations.  These are the first measurements of the Peltier effect and Onsager reciprocity in ferromagnetic thin films near room temperature, and are an important step to confirm the validity of the theoretically predicted Onsager reciprocity in these systems.

  <dc:title>Individual and Family Factors Related to the Reduction of Risk Behavior in Asian Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation study examined the risk and promotive factors that can hinder or help adolescents as they transition into adulthood. Chinese, Japanese and Korean adolescents were surveyed in order to examine the individual and family factors influencing risk behavior in adolescents. Correlation and regression were used to examine the relationship among variables. Findings from the analysis revealed that promotive factors including: autonomy, easy temperament, emotional intelligence, humor, moral development, optimism and physical beauty, and risk factors including: history of physical abuse, history of sexual abuse, domestic violence, favoritism of siblings, parental depression and parent not aware, were found to be predicative in North America, Europe, and Australia are also predictive for East Asian cultures. Implications of these findings for theory, research, policy and social work practice are explored.

  <dc:title>Navigating the Paradox: An Examination of Compliance-gaining and Relational Development in Hostage Incidents</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study sought to examine potential relationships between compliance-gaining strategy use and the outcome of hostage negotiation events. Persuasion has been identified as being a critical yet understudied part of the negotiation process. Utilizing the theory of Speech Acts, this study argued that compliance-gaining strategies play an essential role in the hostage recovery process. Specifically, compliance-gaining strategies allow the negotiator to exercise persuasion during the negotiation process while also building an interaction context that allows the hostage taker to feel as if the negotiator is working with, rather than against, the perpetrator. This type of relationship allows the negotiator to exert a greater degree of influence in the incident. Through analyzing nine hostage incidents, this study was able to identify compliance-gaining tactics that related to the outcome of hostage events. Compliance-gaining tactics that reduce relational distance were related to peaceful outcomes and compliance-gaining tactics that increased relational distance were related to unsuccessful outcomes. This study also found that the use of compliance-gaining tactics was particularly important in the final Resolution stage of hostage incidents. In examining the ways that the parties respond to the use of compliance-gaining techniques, the hostage takers&apos; use of Agreement or Disagreement were discovered to be related to incident outcome. Practical applications for negotiation professionals, disciplinary contributions, and study limitations were also discussed.

  <dc:title>Therapists&apos; Attitudes Toward Forgiveness: The Influence of Four Conceptualizations on Predicted Likelihood to Assist Clients to Forgive During Treatment</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Research supports the use of forgiveness in psychotherapy; however, little is known about how this process is integrated into treatment. Views on the utility of forgiveness appear to be mixed. Differences in conceptualization appear to exist between interventionists who promote its use and those who argue against it. This study explored the potential relationship between therapists&apos; conceptualization of forgiveness, categorized as either agreeing with popular interventionists or not, and their predicted assistance of client forgiveness, as well as relationships between attitudes toward forgiveness and other potentially related variables Two hundred sixty nine participants recruited from practice-focused graduate training institutions completed a web-based survey. Results indicated there was no significant relationship between therapist conceptualizations and their belief that they will help clients forgive. More positive attitudes toward forgiveness and greater religious commitment were significant predictors of likelihood to assist clients forgive. Attitudes were significantly predicted by religious commitment and dispositional forgiveness, when controlling for likelihood to help clients forgive. Limitations, future directions, and results are discussed in the context of multicultural training, values, and therapeutic decision-making.

  <dc:title>Thinking, with Heidegger, the Religion-Science-Theology Relation</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This work is an attempt to think the essential nature of the interrelationships among religion, science, and theology (RST) out of Heidegger&apos;s engagement with the question of Being. Three primary questions initially motivated this inquiry: First, how are the interrelations (if any) among religion, science, and theology to be understood? Second, is a relation of &quot;dialogue,&quot; in some sense, possible among the three elements of the RST triad? And third, does theology have a rightful place in the public square dominated by the view that science serves as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for rationality and truth? The inquiry interweaves five threads, or lines of inquiry, which are posited as pertinent in the current RST discourse and central to Heidegger&apos;s thought. The first thread consists of the chapter themes: phenomenology, truth, technology, and ethics. The other four threads--comportment toward things, reflection, thinking, and destiny--each &quot;cross-cut,&quot; or traverse, the chapter themes.
      By Heidegger&apos;s lights, each cross-cutting thread harbors a duality: comportment toward things as objectification or non-objectification; reflection as &lt;italic&gt;Reflexion&lt;italic&gt; or &lt;italic&gt;Besinnung&lt;italic&gt; (mindfulness); thinking as calculative or meditative; and destiny as fate or the sending of Being (&lt;italic&gt;Geschick&lt;italic&gt;). Heidegger&apos;s critique of each duality--and the expanded global context suggested here for thinking the RST relation--offer fresh opportunities for reinscribing the customary formulation of theology (i.e., reflection upon religious experience and belief) as a basis for a compelling dialogue among religion, science, and theology today.

  <dc:title>The Journey to Teaching Online: A Case Study of Faculty Preparation And Experiences in Online Teaching</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      When Bill Gates published his book &quot;The Road Ahead&quot; (1995), he summarized the transformative implications of the personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global information super highway.  Almost twenty years later, the tsunami of online programs and the MOOCs (massive online open courses) is impacting the structural integrity of postsecondary institutions and changing the competitive landscape of higher learning at an unprecedented pace.  When Allen and Seaman (2013) asked the question of whether faculty acceptance of online education increased in their Sloan Consortium annual report, only 30.2% of chief academic officers believe their faculty accept the value and legitimacy of online education.  This rate is even lower than the rate recorded in 2004.  With an apparent widening gap between institutional strategy and faculty acceptance, each organization needs to conceptually map its road ahead.  However, only an institution as a whole can decide for itself what kind of change is needed and define what constitutes evidence of lasting change.  This implies a unique transformation of institutional philosophy, culture, strategy, and reward systems for faculty members.  
      Complex adoptive system (CAS) theory (Olson &amp; Eoyang, 2001), suggests that the most powerful organizational transformations occur not at the macro level but rather at the micro level where behaviors and changes began to emerge.  Thus, instead of trying to measure, evaluate, or categorize which faculty member fits into which stage of online faculty development under which framework, this study asked four tenured faculty members to reconstruct their experiences on why they teach online, how they learn to teach online, and what factors influences their journeys to teaching online.  Their narratives painted a landscape of faculty acceptance in institutions and the online learning phenomena in our society.  Ultimately, their stories are really about change.  By studying the &quot;change agents&quot; in a changing organization in a changing industry, this study is not an exercise to identify the best practices.  Rather, this study hopes to inspire new ideas for new ways to conceptually frame the problem facing the faculty, the institution, and the industry in their road ahead in teaching online.  
      The researcher hopes that this study may be used by institution leaders, faculty developers, and other faculty members to: (1) assess the level of progress of their current and future distance learning program, (2) determine how distance learning programs should be established, (3) evaluate faculty development efforts, (4) improve strategies and implementations for institutionalization of their distance education programs, including academic programming and faculty reward structure, and (5) improve online student retention and learning outcomes.

  <dc:title>Emotion Processes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescent Depression</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for adolescent depression, recent findings indicate that positive treatment effects are reduced among youth with a history of childhood interpersonal trauma (CIT). The processing of emotionally-difficult content has been previously emphasized in therapeutic models for the treatment of depression, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The present study evaluated the impact of emotion processes on treatment outcomes in two forms of psychotherapy (CBT and usual care treatment) for adolescent depression. This study observationally coded client emotional involvement, specifically during discussions of trauma-related content, as a potentially critical mechanism of change in proximal (emotion dysregulation) and distal (depressive symptom) treatment outcomes. Findings showed that client emotional involvement can be reliably evaluated, and further parsed into two separate constructs. Overall, results demonstrated limited evidence to support the link between client emotional involvement and treatment outcomes, as no statistically significant associations were found. Methodological and clinical implications are discussed.

  <dc:title>&quot;Wee Women&apos;s Work:&quot; Women and Peacebuilding in Northern Ireland</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      International norms on intrastate conflicts, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, call for women to participate in peace processes in countries emerging from conflict and civil strife, including those divided by identity-based conflict.  However, scholars of post-war recovery in international relations and comparative politics have raised questions about the extent and effect of women&apos;s participation in peace processes, and in politics more generally, in divided societies given underlying social, economic, and political barriers that impeded access to decisive or authoritative political decision-making.  A critical question in the literature on women&apos;s participation in post-conflict reconciliation-related dialogue and joint action relates to whether intra-group &quot;community development&quot; focusing principally on social and economic concerns can contribute to fostering women&apos;s participation in intergroup reconciliation and peacebuilding.  This study explores the experiences of community development in Northern Ireland with the research question: How and under what conditions do women contribute to peacebuilding? The research represents formal interviews with experts in the community and voluntary sector and the women&apos;s sector, informal focus groups, and six months of ethnographic field research based primarily in Belfast. Northern Ireland is a case of protracted social conflict in which the society is still deeply divided, despite successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Women played a significant role in the peace process by forming their own political party--the Northern Ireland Women&apos;s Coalition--and yet are poorly represented in political institutions today. Instead, women dominate the field of community development contributing to peace through capacity-building and other bottom-up practices. Women pursue community development in this case for two broad reasons: first, because it is not political in the formal institutional sense; second, in an environment where women are expected to play traditional roles, community development is interpreted as an extension of these roles allowing women to navigate through the constraints of a gendered public space and employ their roles as women to seek change that does not threaten the political status quo.

  <dc:title>Vegetation Response After Invasive Tamarix Spp. Removal in the Riparian Zone and Semi-arid Rangeland Ecosystems</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      ABSTRACT
      	Removal of Tamarix spp. (a.k.a. tamarisk, saltcedar, Athel) invasion is often involved in restoration of Western, riparian habitat; however monitoring of vegetation after removal is often neglected and thus opportunity for adaptive management lost. To address this need, I have conducted three and half years of monitoring vegetation response after invasive Tamarix removal in twenty-five sites on the East and Western Colorado, starting fall 2009. I am also comparing six different methodologies: Point intercept, line transect, nearest neighbor, meter-square quadrats, nested Whittaker plots, and densitometer with the objective of developing monitoring protocols that can be used by scientists and land managers alike. This project is in collaboration with Branson Trinchera Conservation District (BTCD), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). 
      	My intent is that this monitoring project will help to answer the controversial questions about the ecological impact of Tamarix removal, including testing the prediction that removal of Tamarix will increase native cover, and that an increase in the cover and diversity of desirable species will also prevent secondary invasion of introduced and noxious species. Overall, the project will help to better understand the ecological impact of the invasive species on the invaded native habitat and whether or not restoration efforts are valuable.

  <dc:title>Sound Reason: Radiolab and the Micropolitics of Podcasting</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Over the past 10 years, the practice of podcasting has migrated from the margins of technological conferences to a central role in popular culture. Podcasting is an Internet-based broadcast medium that relies on Real Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds--a peer subscription service--to automatically retrieve and upload content to a portable MP3 player. In light of its growth and popularity, I ask, &quot;what is the podcast&apos;s political potential?&quot; In this project, I argue that the podcast has the potential to serve as an instrument of liberal and neurological reasoning. My project will pursue this line of inquiry by asking three research questions: first, what is the cultural history of the podcast? Second, what are podcasts&apos; political potential? And finally, what are the ethics of critical podcast argumentation? To answer these questions, I will attend to the popular and critically acclaimed podcast, Radiolab. 
      In contrast to technological histories that revolve around the figure of the inventor, I will write a history of the &quot;podcast present.&quot; This method requires attention to the localized moments that become inscribed into podcasting and dictate its use. First, I explore the Duke iPod experiment, which is largely viewed as a watershed moment for podcast pedagogy, enabling podcasting to become educational. Second, I locate the podcast within a historical conjuncture. Additionally, this section theorizes Radiolab acts as a &quot;listening technology&quot; that entrains neurological and liberal sensibilities. Finally, I attend to Radiolab&apos;s &quot;yellow rain&quot; controversy, which problematizes neurological and liberal dispositions by demonstrating how they can court epistemological injustice. On the theoretical level, this project registers the recursive relationship between new media and argumentation to clear a space for new tactics to engage this shifting political terrain. I extend argumentation scholarship by updating traditional argumentative concepts and by inventing new heuristics to accommodate emerging digital practices. This dissertation also intervenes in digital media studies by exploring how political projects and programs recruit new media. On a practical level, this project advocates that podcasts are beneficial instruments that provide citizens with new procedures to adjust their habits and dispositions.

  <dc:title>Acculturation, Marianismo Gender Role, and Ambivalent Sexism in Predicting Depression in Latinas</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study explores acculturation, the Latina gender role of marianismo, and ambivalent sexism in predicting depression in a community sample of Latinas. A review of existing literature regarding these variables reveals that all three constructs can be both risk factors as well as protective factors. Since marianismo and ambivalent sexism may share similar traits, both may be self-protective coping mechanisms by Latinas in the context of a patriarchal environment with structured gender roles and strong gender disparities. One hundred and thirteen adult Latina participants from various ancestries of origin were solicited from the community using an Internet survey tool. Acculturation in this study was measured by the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS); marianismo by the Latina Values Scale-Revised (LVS-R); and ambivalent sexism by the Ambivalent Sexism Scale (ASI). The outcome variable, depression, was measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results showed that Latinas who endorsed higher hostile sexism tended to endorse higher benevolent sexism. Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo tended to endorse higher benevolent sexism. Further, Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo also tended to endorse higher overall ambivalent sexism (the sum of hostile and benevolent sexism). Finally, Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo tended to endorse higher satisfaction, or lower perception of conflicts, with their marianista traits. The correlation between acculturation and marianismo, acculturation and hostile sexism, acculturation and benevolent sexism, as well as marianismo and hostile sexism were all non-significant. Linear regression was conducted to examine whether acculturation, marianismo, hostile sexism and benevolent sexism predicted depression in Latinas. Results indicated a significant model - in particular, marianismo was a significant predictor of depression in Latinas. The other predictors failed to predict depression in Latinas. After controlling for demographic variables, the incremental regression model was non-significant. Despite the model&apos;s overall non-significance, the predictor of age was found to be significant, that is, as age increased, depression tended to decrease. Finally, benevolent sexism was also found to be significant in the incremental regression model, that is, as benevolent sexism increased, depression tended to increase. Marianismo and the other predictors were not found to be significant in the final model. The limitations of the study were discussed, including a small sample size, higher socioeconomic status, as well as the use of an online data collection method. Clinical implications of the study included adding to the knowledge of multicultural competency in the field of psychology, specifically the importance of considering the impact of bicultural acculturation, gender role, clients&apos; perceived satisfaction with their gender role, as well as clients&apos; sexist experiences.

  <dc:title>Social Media and Relationship Development</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The present study examined the use of social media to represent romantic relationships among a diverse, national sample (N=831) of Facebook users aged 20-37. Taken together, results from this study indicate that relationship representation via Facebook is associated with various aspects of commitment, including couple identity, prioritization of one&apos;s relationship, and commitment to the future, and was also associated with stability of the relationship over time. Social media relationship representation was also found to be associated with lower levels of sexual infidelity, alternative partner monitoring, and partner&apos;s jealousy, as well as higher levels of perceived social pressure from friends and family for one&apos;s relationship to continue. No gender differences in relationship representation via social media were found among individuals who were currently in relationships, but single men were found to be more likely than single women to display their single status via Facebook. Among single individuals, displaying one&apos;s single status via Facebook was associated with sexual activity with a higher number of sexual partners. These results are consistent with hypotheses based on commitment theory, self-presentation theory, and economic signal theory. Results are discussed in light of commitment theory, and the fact that many social scientists have perceived a recent societal trend toward ambiguity in relationship development processes among emerging adults. The findings lend support to the notion that social media provides individuals and society with the opportunity to adopt clear, public emblems of commitment, thought by many social scientists to be on the decline. The importance of the volitional nature of social media relationship representation is considered, as are the clinical, methodological, and societal implications of the present results. Limitations of this study and the challenges and possibilities of social media in the field of relationship research are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.

  <dc:title>Clinicians&apos; Perceptions of the Mental Health of Gay Clients and the Effects of Diversity Competency and Modern Homophobia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Attitudes within the psychological community regarding sexual minorities have evolved over time with a significant history of assigning pathology to lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) clients. Though attitudes have shifted, prejudice has not disappeared. Modern forms of homophobia are less overt and subtler expressions of contempt, disapproval, or discrimination and are rooted in internal conflict. In mental health training programs, LGB clients have historically received little attention, failing to prepare professionals to competently work with this population; encouragingly, this trend is changing. The present study investigated how mental health clinicians assess the level of mental health of gay male clients considering modern homophobia and LGB competency. Specifically, it was hypothesized that less mental health would be assigned to gay clients when compared with heterosexual clients, higher levels of modern homophobia would lead to lower levels of assessed mental health, and LGB competency would moderate both of these associations. Eighty-six mental health trainees and clinicians were randomly assigned a case vignette with either a gay client or a heterosexual client. The vignettes maintained the same symptoms and presenting concerns, yet implied different sexual orientations. Participants completed instruments measuring the mental health of the client, modern homophobia, and diversity competency. Results revealed that the sexual orientation of the client significantly predicted the level of mental health functioning assigned with more health being ascribed to the heterosexual client; however, LGB competency did not moderate this relationship. Modern homophobia did not significantly predict the extent of mental health assigned nor was it moderated by LGB competency. Post-hoc analyses suggested that there might be a difference in the assessment of mental health versus assessment of pathology, with the latter being significantly related to modern homophobia. Implications of the study for practice and training are discussed.

  <dc:title>Social Presence and Therapeutic Demands: The Role of Technology in the Therapeutic Alliance</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This research explores whether access to technology mediated resources that expand social presence opportunities during mental health treatment play a role in what therapists report as difficult therapeutic alliance demands. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious mental health problem, characterized by unstable relationships, anger outbursts and impulsive behaviors. People with BPD tend to be high service users and have difficulty remaining in the treatment setting long enough to benefit from treatment services. Treatment studies have found that the therapeutic alliance is a significant contributing factor to successful outcomes; however, the relational and behavioral difficulties inherent among those diagnosed with BPD can make the development and maintenance of a strong therapeutic relationship difficult. As a result, those with BPD are often stigmatized and denied care. To help ensure appropriate access to care and treatment success for this population, those providing treatment for people with BPD need specific tools and techniques for building and managing the therapeutic relationship. One possibility that is gaining popularity in mental health treatments is the use of information and communication technologies as a part of treatment services. However, little is currently known about how the therapeutic alliance is built and maintained through technology mediated communications. To understand the role technology plays in the therapeutic alliance, specifically when there are high demands on the relationship, this research explored how therapists treating persons diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder might use web-based Internet resources specifically targeted for adjunctive use in therapy. In this study, supportive, Internet based treatment resources for a specific form of evidence based BPD treatment, Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT), were incorporated into a DBT Website and presented in various technology based formats, e.g. video, text, or animations, to intentionally vary and expand the opportunities for social presence between the client and therapist.  A concurrent, mixed methods design was used to deepen understanding of what role social presence and web-based resources play in the therapeutic relationship.  The study used a parallel process in which therapeutic alliance, therapist burnout and client outcomes were measured before and after the implementation of the DBT website, using validated measurement tools.  At the same time, therapist and client reports were gathered through qualitative techniques during and after the experimental period.  Results indicate that when different opportunities for social presence were available, therapists increased their communication with clients and did not rely solely on face to face encounters as the basis for maintaining the therapeutic alliance. Opportunities for social presence were reported as positive influences on the therapeutic alliance in the areas of client learning and provision of therapeutic support. In addition, therapists reported a reduction in burnout by having additional therapeutic support options available. The study also found that variations in social presence had a positive impact on client outcomes, as indicated by decrease in symptoms. In addition, there was also a statistically significant difference in the impulse control scale during the intervention period that was not present in the non-intervention group. Implications from this study indicate that variations in social presence and the range of therapeutic tools available for managing therapeutic relationships may result in an improved therapeutic alliance, improved client outcomes and reduced therapist burnout. The exploratory design of this study had several limitations, primarily related to limited ability to link website use directly to client and therapist outcomes. Despite these limitations, this study begins to create a foundation for use of increased opportunities for social presence as a potential support for the treatment alliance.

  <dc:title>Needs Assessment for Animal-Assisted Interventions: Factors Influencing Implementation of Dogs as Judiciary Aids in Criminal Justice Processes in CPS Cases.</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The study presents findings from a needs assessment exploring the critical features or core elements that bear on professionals regarding the inclusion of dogs as judiciary aides in the investigation and prosecution of child maltreatment cases. Specifically, the objectives of the current needs assessment were examined through the following questions: (1) What are the perceived benefits of implementing programs with dogs as judiciary aids throughout criminal justice? (2) What specific roles do professionals identify for dogs within criminal justice, (3) What are potential barriers to the implementation of dogs as judiciary aids programs, and (4) How are the needs and expectations of agencies considering incorporating dogs similar to or different from those agencies that are currently incorporating dogs.
      The study identified a number of differences in the identified roles, barriers, and important factors reported by survey respondents. Quantitative analysis of responses regarding the role of dogs in the criminal justice setting revealed professionals identified roles for dogs that matched their particular scope of influence. Moreover, qualitative findings provided additional insight into participant&apos;s concerns and convictions and their varying perceptions of factors central to the inclusion of dogs in criminal justice processes for child maltreatment. The study relies heavily on qualitative responses of participants. Implications are discussed with regard to micro and macro levels of social work practice and the field of implementation research.

  <dc:title>Modeling HRTF For Sound Localization in Normal Listeners and Bilateral Cochlear Implant Users</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems and for testing algorithms through simulation that would be difficult or expensive to implement.  This dissertation presents a model that attempts to simulate the sound localization performance of persons using bilateral cochlear implants.  The expectation is that this model could prove to be a useful tool in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies.
      The head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of this model, and in the ideal case, provides the base characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects.  This defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues that are important to sound localization.  By building on the HRTF, a sound source localization model can be constructed.
      This model was first developed to simulate normal hearing persons and validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization.  The model was then further developed to account for the differences in the signal pathway of the cochlear implant  (CI) user due to sound processing effects, and the microphone location versus pinna and ear canal acoustics.  Finally, the localization error calculated from the model for cochlear implant users was compared to published localization data obtained from these hearing impaired patients in order to validate the modified model.
      Results of the normal hearing model correlated closely with localization performance data published in the literature, with localization error of the model only slightly greater than that of normal hearing subjects.  The cochlear implant population has a more broadly distributed range of localization error than that of the normal hearing population, and in addition, the mean error is significantly poorer.  The performance of the cochlear implant model fell within the range of error reported in the research literature for cochlear implant users.  This close correspondence with the published performance data suggests that the model developed in this dissertation provides a reasonably good approximation of sound source localization for normal hearing subject and persons with bilateral cochlear implants.

  <dc:title>Longitudinal Effects of Improving Inter-Parental Relationships in Low-Income Couples: Child Outcomes</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Poverty and economic hardship create tremendous stress for families, and subsequently are risk factors for child psychopathology.  The Fatherhood, Relationship, and Marriage Education (FRAME) program is a 14-hour psychoeducation intervention developed specifically to strengthen the ability of low-income mothers and fathers to reduce conflict, cope with stress, and co-parent effectively, hopefully helping to create more stable and secure environments for children.  The FRAME study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a couples-based intervention in a sample of 301 ethnically diverse low-income cohabiting mothers and fathers who are parenting at least one child together. Couples were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups or to an assessment-only control condition.  The current research evaluated the impact of the intervention program on a range of parenting behaviors and child outcomes across four time points for both mothers and father, and examined relationships between economic strain and parenting, and parenting and symptoms of psychopathology across four time points.  Hierarchical linear modeling was used for primary analyses. FRAME effectiveness results showed significant time by group interactions for Anxious/ Depressed and Thought Problems symptoms, as well as Parent-Child Positive Interaction, indicating improvements for intervention participants as opposed to controls, as well as a time by group by gender interactions indicating that mothers in the intervention groups reported the steepest decline for Anxious/Depressed symptoms and Internalizing Problems symptoms across all four time points.  Economic strain was significantly related to a number of parenting difficulties, and parenting variables were significantly associated with symptoms of psychopathology for all participants across time. Implications for future studies involving interventions with low-income families are discussed.

  <dc:title>RADAR Based Collision Avoidance for Unmanned Aircraft Systems</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have become increasingly prevalent and will
      represent an increasing percentage of all aviation. These unmanned aircraft are
      available in a wide range of sizes and capabilities and can be used for a multitude of
      civilian and military applications. However, as the number of UAS increases so does
      the risk of mid-air collisions involving unmanned aircraft. This dissertation aims to
      present one possible solution for addressing the mid-air collision problem in addition
      to increasing the levels of autonomy of UAS beyond waypoint navigation to include
      preemptive sensor-based collision avoidance. The presented research goes beyond the
      current state of the art by demonstrating the feasibility and providing an example of a
      scalable, self-contained, RADAR-based, collision avoidance system. The technology
      described herein can be made suitable for use on a miniature (Maximum Takeoff
      Weight &lt; 10kg) UAS platform. This is of paramount importance as the miniature
      UAS field has the lowest barriers to entry (acquisition and operating costs) and
      consequently represents the most rapidly increasing class of UAS.

  <dc:title>The Last Citizen--A Response to Rawls&apos;s Challenge on Impairment: A Third Principle of Justice, and Extra-Rational Contribution</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      John Rawls, in Political Liberalism, acknowledges that justice as fairness, as it stands, &quot;may fail&quot; to deliver justice to people with severe cognitive impairment.  He continues, &quot;How deep a fault this is must wait until the case itself can be examined.&quot;   The intent of this work, then, is to revisit Rawls&apos;s justice as fairness in light of intervening decades of disability consciousness and the emergence of competing theoretical constructs pertinent to the lives of people with impairment, specifically to people with an inability to reason or to reason fully, and determine whether new perspectives can expand its scope into a more comprehensive model.  
      A fully democratic theory of justice cannot exclude the &quot;hard cases,&quot; so in addition to Rawls&apos;s two principles of justice, the author will argue that a third principle of justice must be included to assure true democratic outcomes.  The new principle will state: All structures arising from the first two principles must be open to all human beings--fully inclusive--without exception.  The author expects that this third principle will be embraced by the reasonable and rational designers because it is in their self-interest to do so.  The concept of self-interest--that interest, which might sway a person&apos;s choices toward personally favorable outcomes--is seen, by this author, as inclusive of favorable outcomes for all people with whom the designer self-identifies.  Arenas of self-interest expand past the boundaries of an individual&apos;s actual person and past the confines of time, to encompass others, including one&apos;s future self, whose well-being is of such importance to the designer as to define her own well-being.  
      Rawls means to assure a form of empathetic behavior when he constructs the veil of ignorance.  In the original position, because the designer is veiled from all of his individual characteristics, Rawls forces consideration of the circumstances of every possible person the designer could be.  The designer must consider those of all possible ethnicities, cultures, genders, classes, economic brackets, endowments, and other individual characteristics.  Yet, the veil can never hide from the designer the fact that she can reason, and, if the designer were to make choices based on a narrow version of self-interest, the circumstances of people with cognitive impairment would remain unconsidered.  Yet, people actually act within a broader definition of self-interest.  The veiled designer cannot know if impairment affects his child or others with whom he identifies, nor can he know, given the nature of impairment, whether he will become impaired imminently or in the future.  The unpredictable and non-discriminating nature of impairment means that its lack of consideration in the original position will expose participants, who all have impairment in a potential state, to the consequences of policy, which fails to address circumstances that might define anyone&apos;s future.  Within an expanded notion of self-interest, the circumstances of people with severe cognitive and physical impairment will be represented because, among many reasons, it is personally advantageous for participants to do so.  
      The social relevance of people with cognitive impairment, the author will argue, highlights the need for a theoretical restructuring of concepts of contribution and value, beyond rationality, that would lead to a reconceived notion of rights-bearing status and positions of respect.  Can theory redefine personhood in a non-traditional way that can, but need not, include the ability to make moral choices, in order to extend value to previously excluded individuals, who nonetheless benefit society through extra-rational contribution?  The author will explore the contributions and subsequent value to society of people with cognitive impairment (and all impairment, for that matter).  Notions of value should not be confused with ideas of intrinsic human worth.  Acceptance of the latter does not lead individuals seeking community, based on mutual advantage, to court the participation of a non-contributor.  Only social valuing can uproot the entrenched notion of worthlessness inherent in terms like &quot;useless eaters.&quot; 
      For all people, life as a human being involves living inside a vessel, which is subject to entropy, disease, injury and imperfection.  Historically, society has sequestered those who provide reminders of the frailty of the human body and mind, and in so doing has doggedly clung to a chosen, comfortable illusion.  What has been lost in this collective behavior is the opportunity to lead truly authentic lives, to embrace and incorporate the complete human experience.  People with impairment can lead us in claiming our full humanity and in so doing make an invaluable contribution.

  <dc:title>Spectacle, Sacrifice and the State: The Legacy of European Fascism and the Revival of Martyrdom in the Modern World</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The rise of political martyrdom in the contemporary world is not a new phenomenon but can be traced back to at least the early Twentieth Century with the rise of European Fascist movements. Both they, and the fascist-like movements of today, share a cluster of characteristics that allow for fruitful comparisons of the ways in which martyrdom spectacles are used to communicate with constituent populations, facilitate a culture of violence, perpetuate their revolutionary zeal and demonstrate the characteristics of the ideal citizen. Examining four major movements; Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, the Palestinian Hamas and the modern Iran, this dissertation argues that 1) the use of martyrdom by today&apos;s fascist-like fundamentalists is not unique, but follows a well-known path taken by the earlier fascist movements of the twentieth century; 2) martyrdom spectacles can be used to build support within the population and present a narrative of the ideal citizen; 3) there are different uses of martyrdom spectacles between the regime phase and the movement phase for both fascist and fascist-like movements. By exploring the relationship between martyrdom spectacles and their disciplining nature, we can better understand the logic of contemporary fundamentalist movements and the techniques they used to achieve power and maintain control.

  <dc:title>The Influence of Gender and Alcohol Use On Depressive Symptoms Among Men and Women</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study investigated the extent to which gender influences self-reported prototypical and masculine-specific symptoms of depression in men and women and whether or not alcohol mediates this relationship. Secondly, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the Denver Comprehensive Depression Inventory (DCDI), in measuring prototypical and masculine-specific depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical samples of men and women. 
      This paper summarizes the literature on gender differences in depression and the assessment of depression and gender, and outlines the current research on masculine-specific depression. It is argued that current assessment instruments identify prototypical symptoms of depression, as outlined in the DSM-IV-TR, but do not assess for masculine-specific symptoms of depression. Next, this paper outlines the methodology of the study, including participants, procedures, measures and data analyses, followed by the results and a discussion of the findings.

  <dc:title>Attrition in a Telephonic Intervention Program for Depressed, Low-Income Patients in a Primary Care Setting</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Telemental health interventions are currently being implemented in primary care settings in order to reduce the cost of providing treatment and increase access to services of underserved groups. Studies of the efficacy of telemental health interventions have generally demonstrated high rates of attrition. Eysenbach (2005) suggested that the reality of high attrition rates in telemental health studies prompts further investigation into the factors related to attrition. Such research should focus on identifying the characteristics of clients who drop out of treatment and at what points such clients are likely to drop out. The purpose of this study was to identify client characteristics associated with dropout from a telemental health intervention for depressed primary care patients. Clients who dropped out at different time points during the intervention were compared to determine whether they differed demographically or on certain baseline characteristics, including severity of depression, self-efficacy, acculturation, treatment expectancy, and co-morbid mental illness. In addition, differences in attrition rates between therapists were examined to determine whether observable therapist characteristics impacted retention in telemental health treatment. Results suggested that participant age and baseline depression scores, therapist age, and changes in participant depression scores over time were significant predictors of attrition from the intervention. Implications and comparisons of attrition in telemental health and traditional psychotherapy interventions are discussed.

  <dc:title>Depression and Suicide Behavior among College Students: Understanding the Moderator Effects of Self-Esteem and Suicide Resilience</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      As suicide-related incidents on college campuses increase and receive intense media coverage and a growing percentage of college students experience suicide ideation and attempts, there is a desperate need for a more profound understanding of suicidality and its risk and protective factors among college populations. Recent years there has been a growing interest in the buffering effect of resilience on suicidality (Johnson, Wood, Gooding, Taylor, &amp; Tarrier, 2011). This study adds to the suicide literature by exploring the relationship among depression, self-esteem, suicide resilience, and suicidality. Undergraduate students from a large university in the Western United States were asked to assess their depressive symptoms, level of self-esteem, level of suicide resilience, and thoughts and behaviors of suicide. Multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between these variables. The results indicate that depression was a statistically significant predictor of suicide behavior. Results also suggest that high self-esteem and high suicide resilience were buffers that protect college students who experience depression from developing suicide behavior. A three-way interaction of depression, self-esteem, and suicide resilience in predicting suicide behavior was also found to be statistically significant. It suggests that when self-esteem and suicide resilience were both high, the association between depression and suicide behavior was the weakest; when self-esteem and suicide resilience were both low, the association was the strongest. Additional clinical implications, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are addressed.

  <dc:title>Fresh Squeezed:The Dilemma of Local Food Production along Colorado&apos;s Front Range Urban Corridor</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Today, the Front Range Urban Corridor of Colorado is one example from the urban/agricultural battlefield. The history of food production and urbanization in this area is similar to many regions throughout the western United States. Originally an extraction based economy, Colorado later became agriculturally/pastorally based, and more recently became a service-based, urban economy. On the Front Range Urban Corridor specifically, the urban core of Denver and Boulder developed with rich agricultural lands toward the northeast to Weld County along the northern border of the state. Though a semi-arid region, this agricultural zone produces a volume and variety of food-based crops due to a vast irrigation network on the rich piedmont soils of the Platte River valley (Whitney 1983, Acevedo and Taylor 2006). Urban development, however, is overtaking agricultural areas as cities grow towards each other and spread out along transportation networks (Acevedo and Taylor 2006). Unfortunately, the same rich, flat, irrigated soil used to grow food is also favored by land developers and home owners. As development and food production are starting to challenge the finite limits of the land, there are choices to make regarding land, development, and local food production. By combining data from the U.S. Agricultural Census with results of an author-driven survey of local producers in Colorado, this project will consider these choices and illuminate the complex web of their interdependence. The principal results display that
      Colorado faces increasing competition for food production and urban development space potentially pressuring local food prices upward and forcing producers to peripheral land or out of food production.

  <dc:title>Mitochondrial Glutathione Transport: Implications for Bcl-2 and Neuronal Survival</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Oxidative stress is a contributing factor to many neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, mitochondria are a key source of oxidative stress due to electron leakage at the level of the electron transport chain. To combat the endogenous production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species mitochondria are equipped with several redox-cycling systems, such as glutathione (GSH). Mitochondrial GSH has been shown to be a critical reservoir of this antioxidant, where selective depletion of mitochondrial GSH can induce apoptosis in several systems. Many studies have intricately linked Bcl-2 to cellular GSH status and it has been previously shown that Bcl-2 is a GSH binding protein. Therefore, we hypothesize that Bcl-2 may play an important role in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport. 
      Here, we show that inhibition of Bcl-2 in primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) induced apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress, selective depletion of the mitochondrial GSH pool, and led to inhibition of mitochondrial GSH transport.  Furthermore, we found that Bcl-2 is an interacting partner with a previously identified mitochondrial GSH transporter, the 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), and this interaction is modulated by GSH. To further support a role for Bcl-2 in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport, we show that Bcl-2 requires OGC for protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and to increase the mitochondrial GSH pool. These data suggest that Bcl-2 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport and that the enhancement of the interaction between Bcl-2 and OGC by GSH may increase mitochondrial GSH transport.  
      The mechanisms of mitochondrial GSH transport thus far have only been extensively studied in liver and kidney, where the OGC and the dicarboxylate (DIC) carrier have been identified as inner membrane mitochondrial GSH transporters. Most studies examining mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms in brain have not allowed for the distinction between neuronal and glial cell mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms. Therefore, we employed primary cerebellar astrocytes and primary CGNs as a system to study mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms and differences between neuronal and glial cells. It was found that cerebellar astrocytes use both the OGC and DIC to transport GSH into mitochondria, while CGNs preferentially use the DIC. In addition, discrete inhibition of one mitochondrial GSH transporter (DIC) using chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown, in CGNs, led to increased susceptibility to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. Overall, this suggests that inhibition of a single mitochondrial GSH transporter is sufficient to predispose neurons to oxidative stress, such as the conditions observed in neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Finally, the consequences of overexpressing a mitochondrial GSH transporter were examined. Stable NSC34 motor neuron- like cell lines were produced which overexpress OGC. The stable OGC cell lines had significantly increased mitochondrial GSH levels and were markedly resistant to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. More importantly, the stable OGC cell lines up-regulated Bcl-2 expression (a protein we have shown previously to interact with OGC) and this phenomenon was due to increased mitochondrial GSH levels. The up-regulation of Bcl-2 was required to sustain increased mitochondrial GSH levels and resistance to oxidative stress. Overall, this study implicates the importance of not only the mitochondrial GSH pool, but mitochondrial GSH transport for neuronal survival. These findings suggest that modulation of 
      mitochondrial GSH transport could be a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

  <dc:title>Faculty Engagement with Learning Outcomes Assessment: A Study of Public Two-Year Colleges in Colorado</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The problem addressed in this study was the assumption that faculty at the postsecondary level in the U. S. are not sufficiently or effectively engaged with student learning outcomes assessment (LOA) activities and/or practices. This issue emerged in two primary ways within the Scholarship of Assessment (SoA) body of literature: (1) as a misalignment of learning outcomes assessment practices between faculty and their institutions, and (2) as a lack of transparency concerning what faculty are, in fact, doing with respect to LOA activities. Two-year colleges reportedly have particular difficulty in discerning whether or not these issues impact institutional efforts to ensure effective assessment practices; thus, this study sought to determine if faculty perceptions about institutional conditions that presumably elicit greater engagement with LOA aligned with academic leaders&apos; perceptions within a community college system.
      A new survey measure was developed and tested to explore faculty and academic leaders&apos; perceptions on three newly established constructs, to examine the relationships between the three constructs, and to solicit faculty perceptions about their own levels of engagement with LOA practices. The new instrument was found to be both reliable and valid within the parameters of this study. Findings also reflected the presence of conditions that reportedly elicit greater faculty engagement, and that increased faculty engagement with LOA practices predicted achievement of effectiveness indicators for both faculty and academic leaders. A gap existed between groups concerning whether or not these conditions increased faculty engagement with LOA practices. Faculty demonstrated they were engaged in LOA practices considered to be effective and achieve institutional indicators for effectiveness, although part-time faculty were considered less engaged than full-time faculty. Gaps existed between faculty and their institutions concerning how to use LOA data to improve teaching and student learning, and how to communicate evidence of student learning to the wider community.

  <dc:title>Longitudinal Interplay of Dating Anxiety and Romantic Cognitions and Behaviors from Adolescence to Young Adulthood</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Dating is normative in adolescence and young adulthood, but can be disrupted and distressing to individuals experiencing dating anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral theories suggest dating anxiety impacts romantic cognitions and behaviors, and romantic cognitions and behaviors impact dating anxiety. Thus far, investigators have been unable to explore the interplay between dating anxiety and romantic cognitions and behaviors because studies are limited by cross-sectional designs. The present study examined longitudinal associations between two types of dating anxiety (dating interactions and active intentions for dating) and romantic appeal, jealousy, and compliance during conflict. Two hundred adolescents participated in the study, which began in the 10th grade and continued for nearly eight years. Autoregressive latent trajectory models revealed appeal, jealousy and compliance were concurrently associated with dating anxiety from adolescence to young adulthood. These cognitions and behaviors also predicted changes in dating anxiety during adolescence and young adulthood, but not vice versa, with one exception. There was some evidence that anxiety predicts an increase in jealousy over time. The findings suggest cognitive modifications of romantic appeal and jealousy as well as social skills interventions to reduce jealous behavior and submissive compliance during conflict could have ongoing benefits for dating anxious individuals. Bidirectional associations between active intentions anxiety and jealousy also highlight jealousy&apos;s role in maintaining anxiety. This study moves the field toward an ultimate goal of enabling adolescents and young adults with dating anxiety to initiate, develop, and maintain beneficial romantic relationships.

  <dc:description>In the late 20th century and early 21st century, contemplative education/studies courses, concentrations, and initiatives have emerged in the academy. Although there has been significant discussion of postsecondary courses and programs that have integrated contemplative views and practices in the literature, there have been few studies of contemplative curricula and pedagogy in higher education. Additionally, there have been even fewer inquiries of the influence of contemplative education on performing arts training within conservatories and college and university departments. The aim of this qualitative study was two-fold: (1) to describe, interpret, and appraise the impact of contemplative education on the curricula of an interdisciplinary conservatory level performing arts program, MFA Contemporary Performance, at Naropa University; and (2) to disclose, compare, and analyze MFA student perceptions of the influence of contemplative education on their professional and personal development. The following questions guided this study: (1) How do faculty and students characterize contemplative education within the MFA in Theater: Contemporary Performance Program? (2) How does contemplative education impact the intended and operational curricula of courses within the MFA Contemporary Performance Program? (3) How do graduate students perceive the effects of contemplative education, offered by the MFA Contemporary Performance Program, on the development of  their communication abilities, presence-in-performance, sociolinguistic perspectives, and aesthetic perspectives?Based on the research methodology of educational criticism and connoisseurship, this investigation provides a vivid description and interpretation of the intended and operational curricula of three core courses within the MFA program. These curricula were examined through five dimensions: intentional, curricular, pedagogical, structural, and evaluative. In order to shape our understanding of the contemplative and performative nature of the curricula, the significant and subtle qualities of the courses were further captured by preparation, context-building, reflective, showing, and closing conventions. Since the courses were grounded in postmodern view, they were evaluated according to Doll&apos;s criteria of richness, recursion, relations, and rigor for the evaluation of postmodern curricula.MFA first- and second-year students primarily characterized contemplative education as body/mind training for performance and personal development, sitting meditation, and cultivation of mindfulness and awareness. Student perceptions of the impact of contemplative education on the development of their communication abilities, presence-in-performance, sociolinguistic perspectives, and aesthetic perspectives, throughout the course of their two-year training, are presented in a dimensional analysis.The research reveals eight different themes that intersect the three core curricula and interviews with MFA students and faculty. These thematics include inclusivity, nowness, silence, improvisation, goodness, heart, training, and space. The beginning letter of each theme combines to form the acronym, insights. The framework of insights connects and illuminates the most potent aspects of MFA Contemporary Performance values and training.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Computational Biomechanical Modeling of the Human Knee During Kneeling</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Total knee replacement benefits patients who suffer from severe knee pain or joint stiffness and other joint related illnesses that limit everyday activities. There has been an increase in the number of procedures performed each year and a need to evaluate the performance of these implants during specialized activities such as kneeling. Most computational studies lack insight into inter-patient variability and the results do not apply to large population. This study developed: (1) three-dimensional explicit finite element (FE) models to investigate natural and implanted knee joint kinematics and bone strain and (2) a platform to enable population-based evaluation by combining statistical model and joint function. Verification of a finite element model confirmed a strong agreement between model predicted and in-vitro kinematics of specimen-specific patellofemoral (PF) joints of four cadaveric knees in simulated kneeling. Three different commonly used PF implants were employed in an additional broader patellar bone strain study to assess the relative performance of these implants during highly demanding activities. This study predicted that the medialized dome design achieves the optimal balance of sufficient congruency between PF articular surfaces while still facilitating sagittal plane tilt to reduce isolated loading of the distal nose of the patella. A combined statistical shape model and FE method were utilized to successfully identify the most important shape characteristics affecting joint performance during kneeling. Scaling in the knee joint has minimal effect on PF joint kinematics but greatly affects joint contact mechanics. Knee soft tissue dimensions alter the kinematics. The patellar bone strain model described here provides a novel platform for further implant performance analyses. The statistical shape-function model is a tool for population based studies to help predict the clinical outcome of joint replacement.

  <dc:description>The maintenance of network connectivity is essential for effective and efficient mobile team operations. Achieving robust mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) connectivity requires a capable link maintenance mechanism especially if the network experiences expected intermittent connectivity due to a hostile environment. One applicable example of such network scenarios is multi-robot exploration for urban search and rescue (USAR). With the proliferation of these robotic networks, communication problems such as the link maintenance problem are subject to be raised quickly. Although various routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks have been proposed, they solve the problems of message routing and link maintenance separately, resulting in additional overhead costs and long latency in network communication. Traditional routing protocols discover existing links, connect these links, find the best path and minimize the path cost. The limitation of previous routing protocols motivates us to develop a new concept of routing mechanism for a robotic network. This routing mechanism is named Meta-Routing. Meta-Routing expands current routing protocols to include not only the normal routing of packets, but also the maintenance of links in mobile agent scenarios. Thus, Meta-Routing minimizes the communication path cost and the overhead cost, the latter of which results from discovering a route, repairing a link or establishing a new communication path between nodes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With the advent of globalization and technological development, English has become a necessary tool of international communication in many areas such as education, business, politics, commerce, science, and technology throughout the world. Also, English has become the most widely taught foreign language in the world (Kachru &amp;Nelson, 1996). Moreover, the issue of successful implementation of the English language curriculum has been the focus of a number of studies. In the case of Libya, however, little research has been conducted on teachers&apos; perceptions of the new English language curriculum in Libyan high schools. Thus, teachers&apos; voices have not been examined or heard regarding this issue in the TEFL field. This study was conducted in a region of Libya called Tarhuna, southeast of the capital Tripoli, where there has been no study with the scale and scope of this research.  The study showed that there were differences between the degrees of CLT principles practice. The percentage of CLT principles practice was 75.4%, with an average mean score of 3.77. Results also showed a number of factors that are considered as major concerns by the participants. These factors included teacher&apos;s limited time for teaching CLT materials, insufficient funding, students&apos; low English proficiency, teachers&apos; lack of training in CLT, few opportunities for in-service training in CLT, large classes, lack of support from colleagues and administrators, a focus on rote memorization in teaching and learning, students&apos; resistance to a learner-centered classroom, students&apos; lack of motivation for developing communicative competence, and students&apos; resistance to class participation. The mismatch between the realities of the classroom, student resistance, and the principles and goals of the new curriculum created a significant challenge for teachers. The data indicate that there is a gap between what is expected in the new curriculum and what is actually being done in classrooms. 
Therefore, I believe the findings of this study provide invaluable information that can be used for the revision and improvement of the English language curriculum in Libyan high schools. The study also sheds some light on the strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum, reveals some of the obstacles and barriers that teachers encounter in implementing the curriculum, and provides recommendations to overcome these barriers where they exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate the implementation process of the new English language curriculum in Libyan high schools by examining teachers&apos; perceptions of the curriculum and how it is taught and reflected in their classroom practices.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The physical structure of cellular membranes plays a critical role in lipid and protein sorting. A novel biosensor was developed to probe the influence of curvature on sorting. This biosensor mimics large, two-dimensional membranes in dynamic equilibrium, achieves high spatial resolution between curvature and molecules of interest, and has high sensitivity, enough for single particle detection. The biosensor consists of continuous supported lipid bilayer formed over nanoparticles (40 to 200 nm diameter) deposited on a glass substrate. The nanoparticles determine the extent of curvature. This biosensor is the first to observe large-scale 2-dimensional diffusion of biomolecules on a supported lipid bilayer with small radii of curvature in equilibrium with flat areas of fluid bilayer. This will allow correlation between protein function and the physical shape of a membrane. Fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify spatial sorting of lipids and a protein relevant to cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein (CRP). Two lipids, fluorescein labeled hexadecanoic acid and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, sense curvature by accumulating in areas over nanoparticles, and both are able to laterally exchange with surrounding lipids. Dynamic fluidity of the bilayer was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Lipids directly at sites of curvature recover more slowly than lipids over flat sections. The spatial distribution of CRP was also assessed. Curvature sensing of CRP is isoform dependent where native CRP does not sense curvature and modified CRP does sense curvature. Finally, we show that a ribonucleic acid aptamer will bind specifically to modified CRP and not native CRP, enabling isoform specific studies of CRP to be conducted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Wind is one of the most popular renewable energy sources and it has the potential to become the biggest energy source in future. Since the wind does not always blow constantly, the output wind power is not constant which may make some problem for the power grid. According to the grid code which is set by independent system operator, ISO, wind turbine generator systems need to follow some standards such as the predetermined acceptable power fluctuations. In order to smooth the output powers, the energy storage system and some power electronics modules are employed. The utilized power electronics modules in the wind turbine system can pursue many different goals, such as maintaining the voltage stability, frequency stability, providing the available and predetermined output active and reactive power. On the other side, the energy storage system can help achieving some of these goals but its main job is to store the extra energy when not needed and release the stored energy when needed. The energy storage system can be designed in different sizes, material and also combination of different energy storage systems (hybrid designs). Combination of power electronics devises and also energy storage system helps the wind turbine systems to smooth the output power according to the provided standards. In addition prediction of wind speed may improve the performance of wind turbine generator systems. In this research study all these three topics are studied and the obtained results are written in 10 papers which 7 of them are published and three of them are under process.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study presents a curriculum history of theological field education at Denver&apos;s Roman Catholic seminary, St. John Vianney. The study utilizes archival material and the historical method to construct an educational historiography of the evolution and development of theological field curricula from 1910-2010. The research questions focus on two areas: the role of the Catholic Church in shaping seminary curricula and the adaptation and application of these Church guidelines by practitioners in the local context. The study utilizes the conceptual tools of Kelly Ritter (2009) to analyze the findings in the light of socio-historical forces which shape curricula. According to Ritter&apos;s conceptualization, socio-historical processes have a greater impact on curricula than “theoretical research-based arguments” (p. 19). The role of the Church in providing prescriptive guidelines for curricula in Catholic seminaries and the application and adaption of these prescriptions in the local context“opens the possibility of generating new conceptual frameworks” and “adds an important dimension to curriculum history” (Kliebard, 1992, p. xiii).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study investigates the formative experiences that nurture ecological habits of mind in youth. The study builds on the ecological habits of mind defined by Moroye and Ingman: caring, a sense of interconnectedness, and ecological integrity. A combination of methods was used in this study: in-depth phenomenologically based interviewing, and educational criticism and connoisseurship. Data collection included two interviews each with five teenagers, one interview each with the teens&apos; mothers, photographing of artifacts, and a focus group with six additional teenagers. Observations and interpretations were filtered through ecological and aesthetic lenses. 
Several key findings emerged. First, it is proposed that three qualities of ecological mindedness be added to those already defined: imagination, active engagement, and self-efficacy. Second, a review of the data revealed that the values of ecologically minded teens include relationship, commitment, and growth. Third, formative influences on the teenagers included experiences in nature (including place, play, and aesthetic experiences), experiences with animals, adult mentorship, community, peer and sibling influence, religion, and story. The aesthetic dimensions of learning (connections, risk-taking, imagination, sensory experiences, perceptivity, and active engagement) were all found to be present in the experiences of the teens; it is proposed that crafting nature-oriented learning experiences with these dimensions in mind helps to nurture ecological mindedness. This study has implications for environmental and ecological education as well as education in general, including implications for teacher education. The values and experiences of the teens help inform the recommendations that educators provide opportunities for natural aesthetic experiences as well as ecological mentoring.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation dwells on the intersections of language-use and perception. The premise is that language makes literal sense and this reality has profound implications for those Burke called &quot;symbol-using/mis-using animals.&quot; Communication scholars have long accepted a model of communication that positions language as &quot;constitutive articulate contact&quot; as opposed to a discrete means of transmission (Stewart, 1994), but a great deal of work remains to be done in terms of developing the implications for individuals and their language-use. Chapter One explores the stances embraced by rhetorical materialists struggling to describe how language matters. The first chapter fields a series of critiques that essentially argue that a &quot;grounding logic&quot; is needed to organize our understanding of the processes of linguistic sense making. Embodied-embedded cognition serves as that &quot;guiding logic.&quot; Chapter Two explores Embodied-embedded cognition, a counter-perspective to cognitivism - the approach that positions sense-making in a dualistic environment where the sense-able stuff of the &quot;real world&quot; and the sense-maker considering that world are different. Embodied-embedded cognition suggests an &quot;enactive&quot; view of worlding that recruits that attitudes and actions of the sense-maker in determining what ultimately becomes real. Chapter Three ties these two conversations together through the use of metaphor, arguing that metaphors make sense. Metaphors can be looked at metaphorically, as a form of &quot;grasping&quot; at the world that is remarkably creative as well as abundant. This perspective on metaphors vindicates the stances of embodied embedded thinkers and rhetorical materialists alike that argue that language matters. 
Chapters Four and Five speculate on some implications for public speaking pedagogy and ethics. Teaching language as a form of &quot;grasping&quot; changes fundamentally the kind of practice that is necessary to improve. Likewise, noting that the language that we employ has a literal effect on perception transforms the ethical implications of our speaking. Chapter Five concludes by suggesting a logic of non-violence as a practical and productive response to the ethical demands placed on symbol-users.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using the discourse of Political Theology as a mode of inquiry we can overcome a longstanding tension between aesthetics and history that characterized much of twentieth century thought. Focusing on literary and occasionally musical works from the mid twentieth century, my aim is to show how works displaying psychedelic aesthetics are important venues for political deliberation with regard to citizenship. Through affective means, psychedelic aesthetics re-imagine the boundaries of liberal subjectivity through a consciousness expansion and return from that expansion. The subject who returns from a psychedelic &quot;experience&quot; - which can be attained in various ways - comes to ethically realign and re-norm his or her &quot;self&quot; according to a moral authority beyond the authority of the nation state. While critical of liberalism on one level, this &quot;expanded&quot; citizenship ultimately offers liberalism political advice in crisis situations by performing a public sacrifice on the state and disseminating social responsibility to individuals. Psychedelic aesthetics perform this `public sacrifice&apos; through affective enchantment, using spiritual and religious rhetoric to change the relationship between citizen and state. Because artistic works of the mid twentieth century are essentially &quot;ahead of the game&quot; regarding states of exception and economic crises, it is to this period that we should look for methods of cultural recovery in current ones. But this requires that we take both aesthetic and religious enchantment seriously in a post-secular world</dc:description>

  <dc:description>First, this research presents experimental and theoretical investigation of the response of micro scale dual-plate thermal-piezoresistive resonators (TPR) and self-sustained oscillators (TPO) to different gases and pressures. It is demonstrated that the resonant frequency of such devices follows particular trends in response to the changes in the surrounding gas and its pressure. A mathematical model has been derived to explain the damping dependent frequency shift characteristic of TPO. The solution of the model indicates that the stiffness of the actuator beam decreases as the value of damping coefficient drops at lower gas density caused by the change in the gas molecular mass or pressure. When operated in the TPR mode of the same device, however, the frequency shift of the same silicon structure is mainly a function of gas thermal conductivity. The two different sensing mechanisms are confirmed by the measurement results showing opposite frequency shift for the TPR and TPO in helium-nitrogen mixtures. In pressure tests, frequency shifts as high as -2300ppm were measured for a TPO by changing the air pressure from 84kPa to 43kPa. Second, the effect of geometry on thermoelastic damping (TED) in micro beam resonators is evaluated using an eigenvalue finite element formulation and its corresponding customized MATLAB program. The vented clamped-clamped (CC) and clamped-free (CF) beams with square-shaped vents along their center lines, are both analyzed. The quality factor and resonant frequency are obtained as functions of various geometrical parameters including the location, number and size of the vents. The numerical results reveal that the addition of vent sections in the clamped end region can significantly enhance the quality factor under TED. The maximum improved quality factor as high as 3,801 and 2,257 times as those of the solid CC and CF beams are realized. The methodology presented in this work provides a useful tool in the design optimization of micro beam resonators against TED. Third, a new method to compensate the TED by taking the advantage of piezoresistive effect is proposed. Such method is implemented by applying an electrostatic field through the MEMS beam resonator with negative piezoresistive coefficient. In the case of vibration, the stretched part of the beam generates higher electrical power thus higher temperature and vice versa. Such temperature distribution can compensate the opposite thermoelastic temperature to suppress TED. The work principle is described by a set of coupled differential equations and then solved by an eigenvalue finite element method. The numerical result indicates that the TED in beam resonators can be completely suppressed when the strength of electrical field reaches a critical value, namely CEF. The value of the CEF is further analyzed by parametric studies on various material properties and geometric factors</dc:description>

  <dc:description>There has been steady interest in the ideology of equity in schooling practices reflected in the written artifacts of the United States, especially in the last thirty years. However, equality-laden language is often used without definition or critical examination. The assumed meaning of equality terminology is problematic--especially for classroom teachers who are directly held accountable for the practice of equality policy. This inquiry critically evaluates the multiple implications of this common-sense usage of language related to issues of equality, equity, sameness, and even democracy. Using the combined methodologies of educational criticism, critical discourse analysis, and self-ethnography, this transdisciplinary investigation describes, interprets, and evaluates the way staff members in a Head Start/early childhood education organization conceive of, and act upon, conceptualizations of equality policy. A close examination of these conceptualizations can serve to assist educational researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in evaluating the implications equality policies have on the teaching practice as a whole, and by extension, the specific learning lives of students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this dissertation, we discussed the shape, energy level and density of defects in Organic Photovoltaic devices(OPV) by both theoretical and experimental methods. Energy band structure and intrinsic junctions of general standard and inverted OPV devices are investigated in detail. Transportation of separated holes and electrons in both structure are well analyzed. In chapter II, we developed a Monte-Carlo model to simulate charge transport process in organic materials. Marcus theory is applied to calculate the carrier transfer rate to build up hopping process in ideal lattices. Results of this model showed several properties of carriers regarding mobility, reorganization energy and Poole-Frenkel behavior. Time-of-Flight(TOF) measurement is simulated by our Monte-Carlo model. Typical four phases of TOF are fitted in simulation exactly as in experiment data. In chapter III, we introduced Impedance Spectroscopy as a useful technique to examine overall electronic component and internal structure. Geometric capacitance and depletion region are found to describe the equivalent circuit of OPV. Another part of this chapter showed that impedance data can be also used by Mott-Schottky analysis to calculate the doping density and built-in voltage of schottky junction, which is widely considered existing in standard OPV devices. Degradation and Life time study are the major topics of chapter IV. We compared three devices within different thickness of active layers under different illumination intensity. Open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor are deeply analyzed to explain the decrease of conversion efficiency during degradation process. In addition, we present simple method to estimate the lifetime of free carriers. In chapter V, impedance spectroscopy is used to investigate the electronic structure of OPV devices, with the goal of understanding the role of defect states. Capacitance-voltage measurements in the temperature range of 77 - 300 K are carried out to determine the activation energy of trap states. Preliminary results show at least one type of defect state residing at 165.6 meV in standard blends of P3HT:PCBM. Furthermore we compared three different molecular weight of P3HT in both standard and inverted devices. Result shows that higher molecular weight provides deeper defects energy level, and density of defects generated during fabrication is different for standard and inverted structures. In chapter VI, JV curve behavior, Capacitor-Voltage analysis and efficiency comparison before annealing and after annealing are showed to conclude that P-N junction is formed at ZnO/P3HT interface in inverted device. We also discussed the free carrier transportation in both structure and explain why annealing leads to different conversion efficiency change. Finally the equivalent circuit is confirmed by geometric capacitance coincidence as well as structure and transportation analysis in whole dissertation</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Poverty has been linked to reduced workforce opportunities, reduced college-going rates, increased social-emotional challenges, and even negative health consequences. Postsecondary educational opportunities, offered during high school, that contribute to the acquisition of social capital may improve academic outcomes for students from impoverished backgrounds. The Colorado concurrent enrollment legislation, provides one opportunity for students to enroll in college level coursework and receive college credits with tuition being paid through state funding while in high school. Concurrent enrollment (CE) programs support the college application, financial aid and enrollment processes. Most importantly, they also support the development of social networks that may foster beneficial secondary and postsecondary outcomes. This dissertation examines the participation and representation rates of free and reduced lunch (FRL) students in CE programs at the state and local level. Next, the impact of CE participation on secondary and postsecondary outcomes in students from impoverished backgrounds is examined. The quasi-experimental research design included a matched control group generated by logistic regression and propensity score matching techniques. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate unaccounted for variance that may have contributed to any observed between-group differences. Between-group differences were examined for a range of outcomes at the high school and postsecondary level. The study analysis was replicated utilizing two additional groups of program participants across two years to increase confidence in the obtained findings. Overall, the findings indicate that FRL students were underrepresented as concurrent enrollment participants during the 2010 and 2011 academic years. A limited number of local education agencies had FRL student participation rates that exceeded enrollment expectations. Statistical analysis indicated that FRL students earned CE credits at a lower rate than their non-eligible peers. In contrast, the FRL students enrolled for a larger number of CE credits than non-eligible students. Additional analysis revealed that a number of positive secondary and post-secondary outcomes were related to concurrent enrollment participation for economically disadvantaged students. The results of sensitivity analyses indicate that other, unaccounted for variables were unlikely to have impacted the obtained findings. The findings of this study indicate that concurrent enrollment opportunities may mitigate some of the deleterious impacts of poverty by improving academic achievement and college-going rates. The beneficial role of social capital for achievement of post-secondary success is discussed</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A novel architecture is presented for reducing communication delay variability for a group of robots. This architecture relies on using three components: a microprocessor architecture that allows deterministic real-time tasks; an event-based communication protocol in which nodes transmit in a TDMA fashion, without the need of global clock synchronization techniques; and a novel communication scheme that enables deterministic communications by allowing senders to transmit without regard for the state of the medium or coordination with other senders, and receivers can tease apart messages sent simultaneously with a high probability of success. This approach compared to others, allows simultaneous communications without regard for the state of the transmission medium, it allows deterministic communications, and it enables ordered communications that can be a applied in a team of robots. Simulations and experimental results are also included.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This exploratory case study examined the perspectives of state-level elected officials regarding what influences policy decisions related to child abuse and neglect issues. By interviewing six former state-level elected officials, the study explored what policy makers believe about their ability to impact child abuse policies, how they define, and ways they have experienced. evidence-based policy, and what they know about risk factors and protective factors with regard to child abuse-related policy. The study design was inspired by the Harvard Family Research Project&apos;s (2005) Bellwether Methodology, which bases advocacy strategy on the knowledge base and input from influential policy makers. The findings from this study are intended to provide insights about how advocates, researchers, and other stakeholders can most effectively influence child abuse-related policy decisions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation presents a design to examine the effects of environmental factors in a country such as education systems levels, corruption, and social freedoms on investment outcomes. The literature review suggests that countries with poor education at the secondary level tend to have lower standards of living, lower levels of freedom, as well as high levels of corruption which appear to have negative effects on their market economies. This study was designed to examine existing data from multiple sources along multiple dimensions, and use a hierarchical linear model, as well as a portfolio optimization model, to assess the impact of these factors. This was accomplished by posing research questions, and collecting and analyzing data from Standard and Poors, Transparency International, and the World Values Organization, as well as the Programe for International Student Assessment. The outcomes of this study generally support the thesis that country-level factors do, in fact, have a bearing on investment outcomes, and that further research in this area is warranted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Harmonics are always present in electrical power systems. Harmonic distortion is harmless as long as its level is within the limit. However, with the recent rapid advancement of power electronics, i.e. non linear loads, the use of the variable speed drives are increasing day by day. Harmonics produced by non-linear loads are a potential risk if they are not evaluated, predicted, and controlled. The power electronic switching devices like thyristor used in the rectifier circuits inject harmonic distortion to the utility grid in different applications. The harmonic distortion causes different problems in the power system. To minimize the unwanted effects of harmonic distortion, IEEE Std 519-1992 recommends the amount of harmonics that is acceptable in the power system. IEEE Std 519-1992 suggests that an individual harmonic distortion to be under 3% and the total harmonic distortion, THD, to be under 5% of the fundamental component. Harmonic distortion can be mitigated using different methods. Based on the system configuration either active filters, passive filters, or phase shifting methods are used. In medium voltage high power applications, generally, phase shifting method is better suited. In addition to harmonic distortion in AC side, AC-DC converter produce ripple in DC side. DC ripple can be mitigated by the use of filter circuits. However, when phase shifting method is used in AC side for harmonic mitigation, a method called pulse multiplication can be used in DC side to mitigate DC ripple. Phase shifting and pulse multiplication methods are investigated in detail in this research. A three-phase 6-pulse rectifier is modeled in Alternative Transients Program (ATP). Voltage and Current waveforms are obtained and the amount of harmonic distortion produced is calculated. It was found that the harmonic distortion produced by an ideal three-phase 6-pulse rectifier to be 31.1% and not under IEEE 519-1992 recommendation. Therefore a 12-pulse rectifier has been investigated. The analysis shows that a 12-pulse rectifier produces 15.3% THD and provides a window opportunity to be used in certain areas where the grid is comparatively stronger. For a rectifier to be able to be used without ac side filter and dc side filter, and to mitigate the THD under the IEEE std 519-1992 recommendation and the dc ripple under the specified value, a higher pulse rectifier will be needed. Further investigation is needed using 18-pulse and 24-pulse phase shifting rectifiers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Algebra is typically the gatekeeper for higher-level math coursework. Low math performance on standardized assessments impedes access to these higher-level math classes. Limited math progress in high school affects future career opportunities and quality of life. High school students who have historically struggled with math need interventions that work. Research indicates that the research on reading interventions far outnumbers the research on math interventions. With the passage of new federal legislation requiring schools to document progress for all groups of students and allowing schools to use Response to Intervention models, the need for evidence based math interventions becomes even more pressing. This research examined the effects of the MIND Research Institute&apos;s Algebra Readiness program in order to provide an evidence base for this intervention. In this pre- experimental study, two groups of high school students were exposed to the MIND Research Institute&apos;s Algebra Readiness program and changes in their math performance were analyzed. Students with and without diagnosed disabilities, were assigned to two tiers of intervention. The double dosed students received instruction with the core Algebra I curriculum and the Algebra Readiness program whereas the single dosed students only received the Algebra Readiness intervention. Independent samples t-tests; ANCOVA, percentage change, qualitative teacher responses and correlation procedures were used to analyze the scores of students. The outcome measures included scores on a post test, grade level curriculum based measures and the state sponsored standardized assessment. Because of limited sample size and possible lack of sensitivity of the outcome measures, overall no significant growth was detected. The students who were double dosed showed significant growth on the end of year, grade level assessment as compared to those students who only participated in the intervention. Although the sample size was small, the effect sizes were large, indicating potential practical significance for this intervention. This research suggests that using visual spatial representations in a mostly nonverbal, computer-based format may show promise as an intervention for students. More research with a larger sample size and a more controlled research design will help definitively answer the questions about the effectiveness of the Algebra Readiness program</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Techno-economic and systems studies on microalgal growth scenarios to date are abbreviated and missing a number of important variables. By including these variables in a detailed model integrating biology, chemistry, engineering, and financial aspects, a more defined systems analysis is possible. Through optimizing the model productivity based on the resulting net profit, the system analysis results in a more accurate assessment of environmental and economic sustainability of specific algal growth scenarios. Photobioreactor algal growth scenario optimization in the system model has resulted in realistic engineering design requirements based on algal growth requirements and fluid dynamics analysis. Results show feasibility for photobioreactor growth scenarios to be economically sustainable when co-products are included, but definite technological advancements and productivity improvements must be made. The main factors inhibiting a cost effective photobioreactor growth scenario are culture density, temperature, and lighting distribution for solar illuminated photobioreactors, and lighting cost for artificially illuminated photobioreactors. Open pond algal growth scenarios do not show any prospect of economic or environmental sustainability with current technology due to the large amount of surface area required, inefficient water use, and low culture density. All algal growth scenarios are inferior to petro-diesel regarding energy inputs, carbon emissions, and environmental sustainability. No algal growth scenarios analyzed in this study meet the U.S. requirement of biofuel emitting at least 20% less carbon emissions than diesel from crude oil.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Teacher burn out contributes to the epidemic of early career exit. At least half of all new K-12 teachers leave the profession by the time they reach their fifth year of teaching. Conversely, there are urban teachers who survive burn out and thrive as career- long educators. This qualitative study is an in-depth look into one 40-year veteran teacher&apos;s career narrative, answering the question: How did this teacher not only survive but also thrive as a career-long urban teacher? Additionally, the following sub-questions are explored: a) How is her spirit sustained throughout her teacher life cycle? b) How can her story contribute to the literature as a counter-narrative to the current rhetoric focused on &quot;teacher bashing&quot;? A critical socio-political lens guides this study. The socio-political forces that lead to urban teacher burn out are explained. The idea of teacher burn in, in which educators experience the symptoms of burn out, but choose to remain in the profession and exist as toxic influences, is discussed and related to teacher career theory. However, the more hopeful idea of urban teacher thrival is uncovered through narrative methodology. This narrative study reveals three salient themes. First hope springs eternal is the idea that sustaining hope supported the veteran teacher&apos;s career thrival. Next, the extended education family is the notion that familial-like relationships at school nourished the teacher&apos;s longevity. The third theme, creative autonomy, reveals that by being empowered with opportunities for curriculum development and instructional decision-making the teacher maintained her passion. Each theme was influenced by the participant&apos;s internal dispositional factors and external conditional factors. These factors are discussed. The above themes, combined with deeply rooted caring relationships with students, proved to be the most important aspects of the participant&apos;s sustained spirit. Furthermore, this study illustrates how teacher narratives can act as counter-narratives to teacher bashing through revealing the systemic impact that can be made by the career of one thriving teacher. Implications for teachers, educational leaders, teacher educators and researchers are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Increasingly, colleges and universities in the United States are adapting toward amodel of behavior that incorporates issues of sustainability. This adaptation inuniversities and in society has implications on the organizational and nation-statelevel, the very core of which may serve to reshape the social contract between thetwo. In addition to supplying a strong counter-hegemonic argument that alters thecompetitive economic agenda-setting paradigm, this study serves as a tripartitecomparative case study analysis of university adaptation toward socialsustainability. By employing a social capital lens to understanding socialsustainability in higher education, this study seeks to examine the relationshipbetween higher education, sustainability, and the nation-state.The conceptualframework of this analysis will draw on Putnam&apos;s concept of social capital, in theeffort to understand the relationship between higher education, sustainability, andsocial capital as well as what a sustainability paradigm could mean in terms of a&quot;new&quot; social contract.The methodology of this study is exploratory and aimed at understandinguniversity adaptation in three ways: first, elements of organization andadministration aimed at advancing sustainability; second, teaching and researchefforts that have been established within a sustainability frame; and third,community and outreach efforts that examines the role of the university in itslocal environment as well as the work toward public service. The specificmethodology employed can be categorized as comparative case study (Yin, 2003).To validate findings, data is triangulated via a between-methods design andcollected through: qualitative survey, contextual content analysis, andcomparative discourse analysis respectively (Jaeger, 1988).  The result iseffectively a 3 x 3 mixed methods design so that each individual case studyemploys each of the three methodologies in order to provide a rich description ofthe social sustainability phenomena and offer data for comparative discourseanalysis.Findings reveal three distinct strands amongst the case studies in the analysisof sustainability discourse. Results show the importance of the role of,organizational context, personal approach of the chief sustainability agent, andorganizational saga in contributing to adaptation. In this way, sustainabilityapproaches and the priority and university adaptation differed. These threeapproaches can be described as: an energy/operations/facilities perspective, aresearch and academic-focused perspective, and a humanistic-grassrootsapproach.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines African-American Islamic culture from 1920 through 1959, a period I label the &quot;African-American Islamic Renaissance&quot; (AAIR). The AAIR is characterized by a significant increase in interest in Islam, extreme diversity in views about Islam, and the absence of a single organization dominating African-American Islamic culture for a significant amount of time. Previous works dealing with African-American Islam in this period have failed to fully recognize these features, particularly the last of these. As a result, explanations for the rise of the Nation of Islam (NOI) have not satisfactorily explained why it was only the NOI--and not other Islamic groups that were more popular than the NOI up until the mid-1950s--that became a &quot;mass movement,&quot; gaining the allegiance of tens of thousands of African Americans. There has been some tendency, for instance, to assume that the NOI was the most popular African-American Islamic group by the early 1950s, a notion that is probably an inference drawn from two other popular but inaccurate assumptions: that the NOI&apos;s rise was due primarily to its radical racialized doctrines and its charismatic leaders, particularly Malcolm X, who became a popular minister for the group in the early 1950s. I argue, however, that the NOI was in fact not the most popular African-American Islamic group until at least 1955, and even as late as 1959 its official membership numbers were not particularly large by AAIR standards. Also, its doctrines were not especially unique in the AAIR, nor was its having extremely charismatic leaders. I contend that the success of the NOI in the mid-to-late 1950s was the result of three levels of changes at the time: internal, external in the AAIR community, and external in the broader U.S, culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick&apos;s disease, and corticobasal degeneration, the deposition of fibrils composed of misfolded tau protein is observed. Recent evidence suggests that tau fibrils transfer between cells and spread throughout the brain, underscoring the significance of fibril propagation. Six tau isoforms exist in the adult human brain that can be grouped into 4-repeat (4R) tau and 3-repeat (3R) tau based on the presence or absence of the second of four microtubule binding repeats. We demonstrate in vitro that seeded fibril growth, a prerequisite for the spreading of the tau pathology, is crucially dependent on the isoform composition of individual seeds. Seeds of 3R tau and 3R/4R tau recruit both types of isoforms. Seeds of 4R tau recruit 4R tau, but not 3R tau, establishing an asymmetric barrier. Conformational templating of 4R tau onto 3R tau seeds eliminates this barrier, giving rise to a new type of tau fibril. Tau fibrils formed in vitro routinely utilize polyanionic molecules as cofactors to stimulate nucleation. A broad set of negatively charged cofactors, including nucleic acids, polypeptides, and glycosaminoglycans were applied to induce fibril assembly. Utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we found that the core structure of the fibril is conserved, regardless of cofactor used. Additionally, we assessed whether a cofactor provides a role in tau aggregation beyond inducing the initial nucleation events, and observed that the presence of a cofactor is needed for fibril propagation to be sustained. The cofactor-fibril interaction was investigated, revealing that cofactors are bound to the fibril and that the basis of the interaction is electrostatic. Cofactor binding is dynamic, as introduction of an alternative cofactor was shown to result in exchange with the bound cofactor. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a tool used for the detection of dilute concentrations of prion fibrils. We have successfully applied this concept towards the amplification of tau fibrils for the first time and demonstrated that fibrils can be amplified, even when diluted by several orders of magnitude. These findings provide basic mechanistic insights into the seeding, propagation, and diversification of tau fibrils. Importantly, we demonstrate that cofactors are not only of consequence for inducing nucleation events, but decorate the fibril and provide a critical role in fibril propagation</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study explores relationships among several established correlates of trauma in women exposed to intimate partner abuse (IPA), including PTSD, depression, and dissociation symptoms as well as alcohol use as well as other trauma-related variables, such as social support and violence exposure. Two analysis methods were utilized: variable-oriented methods, which examine relationships between variables, and person-oriented analysis methods, which examine groupings of participants within a larger sample (N = 233). Results of the variable-oriented analyses indicated positive links among depression, PTSD, dissociation, and alcohol use in women exposed to IPA, as well as positive links between the aforementioned psychological symptoms and exposure to violence. Social support was related to decreased psychological symptoms. Person-oriented analyses indicated the presence of four unique profiles of women within the larger study sample: Profile 1, which was labeled High Dissociation, Low Depression/PTSD; Profile 2, which was labeled Low Symptoms, High Social Support, Profile 3,  which was labeled Low Dissociation, High Depression/PTSD; and Profile 4, which was labeled High Symptoms, Low Social Support. This research supports previous findings about the relationships among several variables related to IPA as well as suggests the need for careful consideration of differences among women within the larger context of research, advocacy, and clinical interventions related to IPA.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Under what conditions do multiethnic political parties win elections in deeply divided societies? Using the cases of India, Indonesia, and South Africa, this dissertation first argues that the nature of liberation movements creates a soft path dependence that affects party formation. Ethnically inclusive liberation movements create conditions conducive to the formation of multiethnic political parties. Yet after this juncture point of party formation, multiethnic politics have dominated India and Indonesia while South Africa has experienced a slow degeneration into ethnic politics. To explain this divergence, this dissertation next examines the interaction of election rules and ethnic cleavage structure. India and Indonesia reinforce broadly crosscutting cleavages with multiple-district and candidate-centered elections. This forces parties to contest elections in ethnically diverse districts with local candidates, which encourages broad-based, inclusive political appeals. South Africa&apos;s electoral system does the opposite. Its functionally single-district proportional representation system incentivizes identity politics by translating control of the ethnic majority into control of parliamentary power. This has resulted in the slow degeneration of Mandela&apos;s multiethnic liberation movement into an ethnically exclusive political party</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Psychotherapy research reveals consistent associations between therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes in the youth and adult literature. Despite these consistent findings, prospective associations are not sufficient to support the claim that the alliance is a change mechanism in psychotherapy. The current study examined the direction of effect of the alliance- outcome relationship, the contribution of early symptom change in treatment to the development of therapeutic alliance, and the potential for pretreatment interpersonal functioning characteristics to be third variables that account for the association between alliance and outcome. Participants were adolescents with depression and a history of interpersonal trauma that presented to a community mental health center for treatment. Findings demonstrated that a more positive therapeutic alliance predicted greater subsequent symptom improvement, even after removing symptom change occurring before the measurement of alliance. Results also suggested that early change only slightly contributed to alliance development. Finally, though pretreatment interpersonal functioning was related to the first session alliance, these pretreatment client characteristics were not related to later alliance or symptom change. Overall, results provided some support for therapeutic alliance as a mechanism of change in psychotherapy. Methodological and clinical issues are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Among the reasons behind construction of the light rail system in the 1990s and 2000s and currently the FasTracks lines, in Denver metro region, has been reduction of traffic congestion and consolidation of land use. This research analyzes the success of the rail transit system in achieving the above-mentioned goals. 
A temporal and spatial analysis of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data from 1992 to 2008 on the highways in Denver has been conducted to determine if traffic congestion has reduced after the initial light rail service began in 1994. Temporal analysis provides an insight into the changes in the level of highway traffic before and after the opening of three segments (Central, Southwest, and Southeast Corridors) of the light rail system. This part of the analysis also compares the traffic levels of highways affected by light rail with those not affected by light rail. Spatial analysis examines whether the changes have taken place uniformly throughout all the highways, or whether they have been concentrated on particular highways. Results indicate that light rail has reduced level of traffic along some of the adjacent highways for a short period of time. Overall, the three light rail corridors in operation have succeeded in lowering the rate of increase in the level of traffic on highways near the rail transit as compared to highways not near the rail transit. Change in the amount of different types of land use namely commercial, mixed, industrial, multi-family residential, and single-family residential has been examined from 1990 to 2010 for Denver and surrounding counties to determine whether greater developments have taken place within the rail transit corridors than outside. The change has been analyzed in terms of total square footage of the building areas as well as land use density. Besides descriptive statistics, inferential statistics have been used for Denver County only, to determine if the changes are significantly different within and outside the rail transit corridors. The growth of commercial land use has been higher within the rail transit corridors in all the counties. The growth has been statistically significant for Denver County. Single-family residential land use has noticeable increased outside the rail transit corridors in all the counties. However, the growth has not been statistically significant throughout the study time period in Denver County. The other types of land use have not shown any consistent pattern in their growth. Overall, the present and proposed rail transit lines in Denver metro region have been very successful in consolidating commercial land use around them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Even 150 years after Charles Darwin published &lt;italic&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/italic&gt;, public school teachers still find themselves dealing with student resistance to learning about biological evolution. Some teachers deal with this pressure by undermining, de-emphasizing, or even omitting the topic in their science curriculum. Others face the challenge and deliver solid scientific instruction of evolutionary theory despite the conflicts that may arise. The latter were the topic of this study.  I interviewed five teachers that had experience dealing with resistance to learning evolution in their school community. Through these in-depth interviews, I examined strategies these teachers use when facing resistance and how they help students deal with the cognitive dissonance that may be experienced when learning about evolution. I selected the qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship to organize and categorize my data.  From the interviews, the following findings emerged. Experienced teachers increased their confidence in teaching evolution by pursuing outside professional development. They not only learned more about evolutionary theory, but about creationist arguments against evolution. These teachers front-load their curriculum to integrate the nature of science into their lessons to address misunderstandings about how science works. They also highlight the importance of learning evolutionary theory but ensure students they do not have an agenda to indoctrinate students. Finally these experienced teachers work hard to create an intellectually safe learning environment to build trusting and respectful relationships with their students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation uses the connections between loops and their associated permutation groups to study certain varieties of loops. We first define a variety of loops generalizing commutative automorphic loops and show this new variety is power associative. We show a correspondence to Bruck loops of odd order and use this correspondence to give structural results for our new variety, which in turn hold for commutative automorphic loops. Next, we study a variety of loops that generalize both Moufang and Steiner loops. We extend on known results for Moufang loops and then extend two different doubling constructions for creating Moufang and other varieties of loops. We then give a general construction to create simple RCC loops from $GL(2,q)$ for $q$ a prime power. Finally, we consider a generalization of Bruck loops, and show that different companions of pseudoautomorphism live in certain subloops.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Trauma-focused Involvement in Psycohotherapy: Relations with Therapeutic Alliance andSymptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</dc:title>
  <dc:description> Childhood trauma is a risk factor for a wide range of psychopathology and other damaging outcomes later in life (Cohen, Mannarino, Murray, &amp; Igleman, 2006; Saunders, 2003). Among the many treatment models developed for maltreated youth and their families, both specific and non-specific therapeutic factors such as developing a trauma narrative (e.g., trauma self-disclosure) and forming a strong therapeutic alliance have been identified as ―active ingredients‖ that contribute to positive treatment outcome (Cohen &amp; Mannarino, 1996a, 1998a; Friedrich, 1990). The current study used data from the Aurora-Adolescent Mood Project, a community based randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioral treatment for adolescents with depression and prior interpersonal trauma experience. This study used the same participants from the Aurora-Adolescent Mood Project to evaluate an observational coding system (Trauma Involvement Rating scale - TIRS) for trauma-focused involvement within therapy sessions. The sample consisted of 29 participants between the ages of 12 and 18 with a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder (Major Depressive Disorder (n = 23), Dysthymic Disorder (n = 2), or Depressive Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (n=4). 142 segments that were flagged as having trauma-focused discussion from 29 cases were evaluated for level of involvement. It was hypothesized that the association between pre-treatment PTSD-Avoidance symptoms and trauma-focused involvement in therapy would be moderated by the therapeutic alliance. Hierarchical regression did not reveal a significant interaction between PTSD-Avoidance symptoms and therapeutic alliance in predicting mean trauma-focused involvement. In order to further explore adolescents&apos; involvement in trauma-focused discussion separate from the therapist contribution, TIRS item one (Does the adolescent initiate discussion or introduce topics related to his or her trauma experience) was examined individually. Using linear regression, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and PTSD-Avoidance symptoms significantly predicted adolescent initiation of trauma-focused discussion. These results indicate that the higher level of symptomatology and distress present at pre-treatment the more frequently adolescents are going to initiate discussion about interpersonal trauma they have experienced. Overall, this study was the first to investigate trauma-focused involvement using an observational coding system with a community sample of depressed adolescents who had experienced interpersonal trauma. Future research should continue to utilize observational coding methods to analyze trauma-focused involvement with a larger sample of youths who have experienced interpersonal trauma.

  <dc:title>A Theological Inquiry Regarding The Practice Of The Eucharist In Cyberspace</dc:title>
  <dc:description>This study looks at the Eucharist in cyberspace, beginning with a case study of a faith community who met with controversy after the group shared the ritual in cyberspace. Based on a qualitative study of the practice and its aftermath, the theoretical analysis includes the nature of the Internet itself and its capacity as a location for
networked communities; its capacity to operate as a communication medium for a religious ritual; and the involvement of active users. The users in this case were members of a religious community interested in preserving their Eucharist theological tradition. The first set of major issues revolves around the process of negotiating the manner in which the practice and the use of technology can be reconfigured to accommodate the innovation. Such reconfiguring involves a level of interaction in which the criteria of a networked community for
Eucharist can be said to exist. Negotiating a use of the Internet should give attention to aesthetic elements that makes for a robust engagement using the medium. The next set of major issues involve evaluating whether or not a Wesleyan/holiness theology of Eucharist, nuanced by a Calvinistic view of Christ’s presence, would be fitting to an online venue. I explored a creative redeployment of these theological traditions in terms of Eucharist in cyberspace being a networked communication of grace characterized by the agency of the user, who joins other participants in a sacramental encounter with Christ. I analyzed what each piece looked like theologically in tandem with a cultural perspective of the Internet and religious practice in cyberspace. I concluded that there was theological warrant for adapting the Eucharist to cyberspace for a legitimate practice that could fulfill the religious and theological purposes sought by a networked community.

  <dc:description>Education policy has focused on teacher quality and student achievement since the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, which defined teacher quality in terms of teachers&apos; professional qualifications and certification.  This is consistent with a history of econometric studies examining the effects of teacher background characteristics on student achievement.  More recently, researchers have argued that investigations of teacher effectiveness should examine what actually happens in the classroom, and that teacher attitudes and instructional practices are conspicuously missing from the prior research.This study uses a two-phase parallel mixed methods design to explore teacher perceptions of the influence of their background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement.  The first phase is a quantitative analysis using structural equation modeling and data from the Early-Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to examine the relative effects of teacher background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement.  The second phase is a case study of an innovative elementary school meeting State expectations for student growth.The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that teacher attitudes typically have a significant effect on student achievement, but teacher background characteristics and perceptions related to their instructional practices do not.  The teachers in the case study agreed that teacher attitudes are important and are likely to have an effect on students, as well as on other teachers.  However, the teachers in the case study also perceived that a number of instructional practices are crucial to increasing student achievement and closing achievement gaps.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Autism is a debilitating disorder (Yurov et al., 2007) that is diagnosed in 1 in 88 children in America (CDC, 2012). The autism population overwhelmingly performs weakest in reading comprehension as compared to other academic areas (Chiang &amp; Lin, 2007; Minshew, 1994). This identified weaknesses is concerning because comprehension is understood in the literature as the most critical curricular area (Chiang &amp; Lin, 2007). One potential reason for these comprehension problems could be impaired imagery. &lt;/DISS_para&gt;

&lt;DISS_para&gt;Neuropsychology research has found that children with autism cognitively process imagery differently than typical children, due to their unique brain structures (Just, Cherkassky, Keller, &amp; Minshew, 2004). This study sought to uncover whether or not children with autism show weaker abilities on imagery-related comprehension tasks than typical children. However, no instrument exists that is validated for this purpose.&lt;/DISS_para&gt;

&lt;DISS_para&gt;Archived diagnostic data were examined to develop a scale to assess imagery-related comprehension skills. Data were analyzed from 71 children (N=71), with and without autism, aged 5-13. A four phase approach from Benson &amp; Clark (1982) was used to develop the instrument. A multiple regression analytic method was used to see whether or not diagnosis was a significant predictor of scores on the imagery scale. Results were that children with autism scored significantly lower than typically developing children, controlling for the effects of IQ, age, and gender. Implications for practice are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Achieving effective learning via digital media continues to be a major concern in contemporary education. The daily use of all forms of digital media is part of our lives and therefore becomes a key component of education. Educators must consider the process of digital media curriculum as a learning model and form of experience adapted to education. This means the significance is on how to learn as well as what to learn. This study demonstrated how the implementation of digital media curriculum via the Scratch game-making project contributed to middle school students&apos; interaction with the entire educational process. The goal was to rethink the role of digital media in transforming schooling. Based on classroom observation and interviews with the teachers and students from four middle schools in Denver, Colorado, the qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship was employed to examine the use of digital media and the interaction between teaching and learning. Several themes emerged: (a) The production of digital media influenced students&apos; behavior and educators&apos; attitudes towards formal and informal learning; (b) digital citizenship is a substantial lesson in the course of digital learning and an understanding of the digital framework of society; (c) new literacy is critical, because ever-changing equipment supporting the digital experience provides dynamic and contrasting ways of connecting with society; (d) the reward of learning is by doing versus being told, and deeper learning is attained by students&apos; interacting with their own work; and (e) digital media programs, such as making video games for learning, provide students skills in communication, theoretical, aesthetic, creativity, and technical knowledge necessary for becoming successful digital citizens. The research revealed students&apos; enjoyment and effort in this new form of learning experience, which enhanced their critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity under teachers&apos; well-planned guidance. The challenge for educators is to constantly review and design educational approaches supporting students towards using the tools meaningfully and within a defined learning experience, continuing to help students become active participants and authors of their own identity and creativity. Educators need to find the best usage of digital media technology, providing students every advantage towards reaching an informed global perspective.</dc:description>
