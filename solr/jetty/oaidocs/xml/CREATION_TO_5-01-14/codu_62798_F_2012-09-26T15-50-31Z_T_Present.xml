  <dc:description>This dissertation addresses a complex cultural and social phenomenon: German multiculturalism in the framework of the European Union in the century of globalization and global migration. I use selected cinematographic works by Fatih Akin, currently the most celebrated German and European filmmaker, as cultural texts. This project illuminates cultural controversies, political complexities, and the discriminatory nature of German multiculturalism. Specifically, I show how and why the German society eagerly accepts and successfully integrates Italian immigrants, yet, culturally marginalizes and socially excludes the Turks. My work illuminates how complex historical and political processes of the past, guided by the principle of Euro-centricity, affect the multicultural dynamics in the German society. I also analyze Akin&apos;s positionality as filmmaker, political figure, and a poster-child of contemporary German and European cinema.This project invites critical re-consideration of the question of cultural diversity in Germany and in Europe and suggests transformative approaches towards multiculturalism. I use de-colonizing, critical cultural and critical feminist theories as well as art narrative with elements of performance ethnography for theoretical and methodological framework of my work. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute to the on-going scholarly, political and cultural research in the fields of multiculturalism, identity, and politics of inclusion.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive condition that affects the physical, emotional, and social functioning of individuals. Freed et al. (2001) conducted a double-blind sham-controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of fetal tissue transplantation for the treatment of advanced PD. The authors of that study examined the effects of the surgery across the dimensions of physical and neurological functioning. A quality of life (QoL) study was conducted to determine if there were differences in QoL when comparing those who received the fetal tissue transplantation with those who received the sham surgery (McRae et al., 2004).While there is little research on the effectiveness of fetal tissue transplantation as a treatment for PD, there is even less literature on longitudinal effects of this treatment. This study examined the longitudinal QoL among participants who received the fetal transplant surgery beginning in 1995. Participants included 11 people who were in the parent (Freed et al., 2001) and original QoL (McRae, 2004) studies. Participants completed several questionnaires that assessed many of the dimensions of QoL. Information from the questionnaires was compared to data collected before surgery, and at one and two years following surgery. Results indicated that Social functioning at baseline significantly predicted participants&apos; Physical functioning over ten years later</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since 1990, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has supported mixed-income redevelopment (MIR) strategies to address the problems of concentrated urban poverty neighborhoods with traditional public housing structures. This study focused on two neighborhoods in Denver, Colorado, with more than 38% of the residents living in poverty, which are facing transit-oriented MIR in the coming years. Residents in both neighborhoods have engaged in formal planning processes and community organizing as a way to be prepared for the change.The study posed three research questions: (1) what predicts a community&apos;s readiness for MIR, (2) what predicts resident involvement as community activists in neighborhood organizations, and (3) what are public housing residents&apos; responses to the evidence of previous HOPE VI project outcomes and their perspectives on what is needed for transition and relocation success. A mixed methods design was used that included a quasi-experimental survey of residents in the two neighborhoods (n=387), in-depth interviews (n= 25) of residents in one neighborhood where redevelopment is already underway, and the analysis of public artifacts and documents available during the study process. Residents participating in the survey were predominantly female (73%), Hispanic (44%) or African American (22%), and had incomes of less than $12,500 (76%). The majority of the sample resides in traditional public housing (66%), as well as those residing in redeveloped public housing (21%), low-income HUD subsidized apartments (11%), and neighboring houses (12%).Research question one found that readiness for transit-oriented MIR can be predicted with social cohesion, organizational collective efficacy, and having a transition and/or relocation plan. Research question two found that involvement in neighborhood organizations can be predicted by resident awareness of neighborhood problems, resident activism, and their perception of their community&apos;s capacity for change. Research question three found that residents facing a MIR move are already distressed, if they are going to move want to move up, and require multisystem support. The research addresses the HUD goal to build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination. Implications for social work practice include the need to include both clinical supports and community processes to help prepare residents for change.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This research project examined how forgiveness was managed by adult friends after relational transgressions. It studied how the emotion of empathy promoted the act of forgiving and why the construct of commitment related to trust and relational satisfaction among friendship dyads. Isolating the specific emotion empathy in regards to forgiveness heightened the understanding of what emotional behaviors were used to maintain friendships once a relational transgression was experienced. Measuring and analyzing the interaction between commitment, trust, and relational satisfaction helped to determine how these constructs promoted forgiveness among adult friends.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Study of Transient Variations in Cosmic Ray Proton Intensities Using BESS-Polar I Data</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The intensities of galactic cosmic rays are modulated upon entering the heliosphere. These variations, defined as solar modulations, are classified as long-term or transient modulations based on their durations.Studies have correlated the transient variations with the characteristics of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field. Therefore, studies of transients augment our understanding of physical processes in the interplanetary medium. Processes causing transient variations may also induce geomagnetic storms. Precise measurements of cosmic ray fluxes during a transient phenomenon will have immense use in validating models of space weather prediction.BESS (Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer), a US-Japanese collaborative program, directly measures light elements of cosmic rays in a large energy range (&amp;sim0.1 - several hundred GeV) thus bridging the gap between the low energy space-based and high energy ground-based experiments, has a large geometrical acceptance (0.3 m&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt; sr), and is highly sensitive in the lowest energy regime of cosmic rays where the solar modulations occur. BESS measurements can provide study of transient variations of cosmic ray protons and helium, for same energy but different rigidities (momentum per unit charge) or the same rigidity but different energies, as separate probes. BESS is sensitive to diurnal variations, unlike space based experiments.Proton fluxes from BESS-Polar I (flown from Williams Field, Antarctica, December 13-21, 2004), calculated for energies 0.1-100 GeV in time intervals as short as 4 hours, are analyzed for variations. Energy dependence of the observed variations is explored using smaller energy intervals. Neutron monitor data support our observations. To our knowledge, this is the first direct measurement of variations at the few-1% level by a balloon or satellite experiment at time scales of a few hours.Proton fluxes are presented in 4-hour averages, suitable for validation of solar wind and space weather prediction models. Suggested physical interpretations of the three observed features in the proton spectra, derived by comparison with the solar wind and IMF data from space-based experiments, include presence of a corotating interaction region or a magnetic cloud or a combination of both, a turbulent interaction region, and Compton-Getting anisotropy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Student achievement is not progressing on mathematics as measured by state, national, and international assessments. Much of the research points to mathematics curriculum and instruction as the root cause of student failure to achieve at levels comparable to other nations. Since mathematics is regarded as a gate keeper to many educational opportunities as well as, eventually, potential job prospects, critics are asking schools to fix the problem. This research project is a comparison of two different interventions used to improve student performance as tested on the Colorado State Assessment Program (CSAP). The first intervention, increased time-on-task, was used at Freedom High School for the school years 2004-2005 until 2008-2009. In those years, mathematics achievement did not improve and CSAP scores showed a negative trend. In the school year 2009-2010, Freedom High School used a computer-assisted instruction program as an intervention for low performing students. A matched-pair design was used to compare these two interventions to determine if the new intervention would improve student achievement.Eighth grade CSAP scale scores for both groups were used as a pre-test and ninth grade CSAP scale scores were used as a post-test. Pre-test mean scale scores were compared to determine variance between the groups. An analysis of covariance was used as a control for the mean differences. The statistical analysis showed that the computerassisted instructional program was ineffectual in improving student achievement in the sample group selected. Chapter Five offers discussion focused on the reasons why the computer-assisted instruction program did not work and possible solutions to correct the problems in the future. References are made to the fact that pedagogy must change if real achievement gains are going to be made by students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Class I (&lt;150 kg) autonomous helicopters are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of non-military applications such as, surveillance, reconnaissance, traffic monitoring, emergency response, agricultural spraying, and many other &quot;eye in the sky&quot; missions. However, an efficient landing/takeoff platform with refueling/recharging capabilities has not yet been developed to increase the endurance and decrease the cost for Class I helicopters.This dissertation presents a three-prong approach for increasing the range and endurance of Class I autonomous helicopters, which will then spur demand by non-military organizations wanting to take advantage of such capabilities and, therefore, drop their price.  The proposed Intelligent Self-Leveling and Nodal Docking System (ISLANDS) is developed as a mobile refueling/recharging station, which is one part of a three-pronged approach. ISLANDS is an electro-mechanical system that provides a safe landing surface for helicopters on gradients of up to 60%. ISLANDS operates &quot;off the grid&quot; and, therefore, must provide its own energy sources for the refueling/recharging tasks it performs. A method for determining ISLANDS&apos; energy needs for refueling/recharging of gas and/or electric helicopters for an arbitrary number of days is provided as the second part of the three-pronged approach. The final step for increasing autonomous helicopter endurance is a method for determining placement of ISLANDS nodes in the area to be serviced ensuring that the helicopters can achieve their mission goal.In this dissertation all aspects of the three-pronged approach are presented and explained in detail, providing experimental results that validate the proposed methods to solve each of the three problems. A case study using Commercially Off The Shelf (COTS) components that shows how all the parts of the proposed three-pronged solution work together for increasing the endurance of Class I helicopters is provided as a conclusion to the dissertation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, and to what extent, Conscientiousness, as part of the personality construct, and Self-Awareness, as part of the emotional intelligence construct, influence the occupational stress outcomes of absenteeism and burnout in culinary chefs. The research method and design selected for this study was a quantitative correlation and regression. The researcher selected the Self-Awareness factors from the ECI - 2.0, and the Conscientiousness factors from the NEO-FFI to measure the individual and interactive effect on absenteeism and burnout. The experience of burnout itself was measured the Maslach Burnout Inventory - GS, and absenteeism was measured by reported number of days absent from work. This study utilized an online survey of 66 questions, including 39 items based on these well-established measures in scholarly research and 27demographic items compiled by the researcher. Of the 213 restaurant chefs who were sent the survey, 70 responded rendering a return rate of 32.86%. The majority of the respondents were Caucasian males of an average age of 35. Nearly one-third of the sample was composed of Executive Chefs, while approximately 29 percent were Sous-Chefs. Another 14 percent were Chef Owners, and 13 percent were Junior Chefs. The vast majority (89 percent) worked at a free-standing restaurant. The findings of this study revealed that Conscientiousness significantly affect burnout in culinary chefs. No other tested variables correlated with statistical significance in this study. Several non-tested variables demonstrated significant correlations in the relationships between demographic data, Conscientiousness, and burnout primarily.This study contributes to the field by adding information for future research ideas, literature reviews, research design, and data collection and analysis when utilizing Conscientiousness, Self-Awareness, burnout and absenteeism in the study of occupational stress outcomes. Specifically, it addressed some important first step finding for understanding how certain personality factors and emotional intelligence factors might influence occupational stress outcomes in culinary chefs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A latin square of order n is an n by n array whose entries are drawn from an n-set of symbols such that each symbol appears precisely once in each row and column. A transversal of a latin square is a subset of cells that meets each row, column, and symbol precisely once.There are many open and difficult questions about the existence and prevalence of transversals. We undertake a systematic study of collections of cells that exhibit regularity properties similar to those of transversals and prove numerous theorems about their existence and structure. We hope that our results and methods will suggest new strategies for the study of transversals.The main topics we investigate are partial and weak transversals, weak orthogonal mates, integral weight functions on the cells of a latin square, applications of Alon&apos;s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz to latin squares, and complete mappings of finite loops.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Assessing the Success of Dual Use Programs: The Case of DARPA&apos;s Relationship with SEMATECH-Quiet Contributions to Success, Silenced Partner, or Both</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation investigates a major change in U.S. Government research and development policy away from its traditional mission-based model, toward a distinctly commercially-oriented research approach. The SEMATECH project is offered as an example of a Government Industry Partnership (GIP) dedicated to the development of dual-use programs (DUP) with the stated purpose of regaining technological superiority and market dominance in the production of a technology that had significant implications to national economic and military security.   The study, builds upon the previous research of Horrigan, 1996; Porter, 1990; Geisler, 1993, 1997, 2003; Fong, 2000; Harlen 2008, 2010; and Brown, 2010.  The study utilizes the process tracing methodology, and structured interviews to make some level of commentary concerning the effectiveness of the SEMATECH model and whether or not this model enabled the government and its primary sponsor, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to acquire any tangible technological benefits (equities) for the funds invested. This study also endeavors to ascertain under what conditions DARPA contributed to the success of this project, and if the government served a distinct and necessary purpose in advancing competitiveness.   The study presents unexpected findings concerning the government equities that should have emerged from SEMATECH.  The unexpected findings reveal that the government did not receive any tangible return on its investment in SEMATECH in part because it did, or could not focus its efforts on repeatedly emphasized government research agendas.  This inability to advance its research interest is a direct result of how SEMATECH was formed, and how it was funded.  In spite of the severe limitations associated with the U.S. government&apos;s abdication of direction setting prerogatives, DARPA still managed to make contributions that were necessary to the success of SEMATECH&apos;s commercial and competitive objectives.  Conclusions include indications that policy structured using SEMATECH as a model may not be the best model upon which to build future GIPs which focus on DUPs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&lt;italic&gt;Beyond This Point Are Monsters&lt;/italic&gt; is a creative work which establishes a fluid, unstable space between the mediated image and the written word. It addresses issues of repetition and difference in the TV melodrama and the inscribed surface of the house in the Gothic novel, performing the romantic and sensational tropes of the Gothic formula in order to subvert them. The project investigates and inhabits the soap opera &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; which aired daily on ABC from 1966 to 1971, and examines the manner in which the show defies its own genre conventions. I chose &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; as the foundational source for my text because it is a program which incessantly crosses its own boundaries. Conventionally, soap opera is a form of fictional realism, but the digressive concerns of &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; stray far from the everyday, while its necessarily fast production pace lacerates the program with constant failure and mistakes. &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; is flawed, but in a way which troubles the rules of genre and the viewer&apos;s relationship to the screen. My investigation is manifested in the form of fictional writings and photographs which borrow the conceptual metaphors and visual gestures of the show. Each &quot;episode&quot; of &lt;italic&gt;Beyond This Point Are Monsters&lt;/italic&gt; mirrors a plot that is anterior to the show&apos;s own official plot, leaking language and images that are withheld and effaced in the original.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The dissertation is a creative prose project entitled &quot;Big City.&quot;  The book will be divided into four sections. It consists of sets of twelve vignettes with the same titles that are interspersed within their sections, as well as longer poetic prose pieces, and twelve short stories. The first section contains twelve vignettes, each under the title of &quot;People in the city are alone in their beds.&quot; People&apos;s lives are difficult to &quot;get going,&quot; so are books, and so are cities. The hope is that the voices will create a sense the necessary masses that are the city. The first section of the book also contains two longer pieces entitled &quot;A man in the city is writing a story on a bus&quot; and &quot;There are horses and lights in the city.&quot; These segments are intended to capture the movement that is possible in a big city, that is possible in language, as well as become those singular structures, or monuments, that set a city apart. Throughout the text movement of thought is reflected, and reflects back on, the organization of the text itself. The first section also includes vignettes entitled &quot;A woman in a city misses a man in another city.&quot; These vignettes are as close as the book comes to telling a cohesive plot driven story. There is a progression of story line through the thoughts of the &quot;woman&quot; that eventually ends the full cycle of the book. The woman misses a man she fell in love with after she spent one day with him in his city, and so wants him to visit her in her city. The next section is twelve short stories told in different forms, from third person omniscient to dialogue only. All the stories are located by the fact that the characters, or voices, involved live in a city. The third section contains three sets of twelve vignettes. The first twelve vignettes are entitled &quot;Things that can only happen in the city.&quot; There proper names are used tell little mini life stories and situations that can only occur in cities. The next twelve vignettes entitled &quot;There are all kinds of people in the city&quot; are used to explore race and diversity issues in dialogue and thought only.  And vignettes entitled &quot;Why is the city beautiful?&quot; set out to give different perspectives on what creates a sense of aesthetics in such an unnatural environment. The fourth section of the book is twelve longer vignettes entitled &quot;The other cities&quot; narrated in the same voice as the one used in &quot;A girl in the city misses a boy in another city.&quot; The texts ends when the &quot;woman&quot; has gone to the &quot;his&quot; city and to another unnamed city and has come back to her own alone still.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Career Pathway Experiences of Three Female School Superintendents: A Phenomenology</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Women represent 75 to 80 percent of the teachers across the U.S. (Glass, 1992), and the percentage of female superintendents is not in alignment with the female workforce.  Research indicates that the career pathways of male and female superintendents differ. While male superintendents often have a sequential pathway to a superintendency, women tend to take more of a labyrinth type of pathway resulting in a longer, indirect path to the superintendent position (Eagly and Carli 2007). This study examined the career pathways of female superintendents, and the support needed to increase gender equity for the superintendency. This dissertation examines the career pathways of three superintendents in a Southwestern state of the United States. Standpoint theory framed the identification of female superintendents as a phenomenon, and qualitative interviews elicited the voices of the female superintendents.The results of this study were somewhat surprising. The female superintendents had similar career pathways as male superintendents, had male mentors, were not intentional about the superintendency, and perceived themselves as innovative. The linear pathways of these female superintendents contradict earlier research, and their self identification as innovators gives them an identity that is focused around a need.  This research provides insight into how to support women in their pathways toward the superintendency.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Caring Work:  Opening a Space of Possibility for Exploring Transnational Feminist Solidarity between Privileged and Marginalized Women</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Neoliberalism, through its emphasis on personal responsibility and individual freedom in accelerating economic development globally, has only pushed women further into the margin of society. Structural adjustment programs (SAPs), which impose state budget cuts on healthcare and welfare programs, particularly have kept poor women and women of color in poverty and generally, have exploited women&apos;s labor. However, in this age of neoliberalism, women&apos;s solidarity becomes more significant. Because neoliberalism is founded on individualism, its downfall rests on alliance-building. Against this backdrop, I explore the possibility of fostering transnational feminist solidarity between privileged and marginalized women engaged in formal caring work. I have used narrative inquiry in conducting this study to find out whether the signifying practices of care may potentially organize women without ignoring their differences. I examine specifically the narratives of a Filipina caregiver and a Filipina care administrator in the Inland Empire. I argue that caring work opens a space of possibility for building transnational feminist alliances because it enables BeLonging, loving, and transformation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation explores the impact of colorism on Spanish Caribbean literature--more specifically, works of fiction and memoir by both island and diaspora writers from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Colorism, or discrimination based on the shading of skin, manifests itself in Spanish Caribbean literature in a variety of ways. It is often used as a marker of class and/or class difference; it may reflect and/or play a part in shaping cultural standards of beauty or attractiveness; and it signifies the entrenched complexities of the Spanish Caribbean&apos;s history of conquest and colonization. Colorism appears in these texts as both a carryover from Latin America&apos;s problematic histories with race (in terms of slavery and racial mixing) and as an indicator of the problematic constructions of race existing (in the past and present) both on these islands and in the United States. Race, constructions of race, and racism have all played a complex role in the histories of these island nations, and it seems only fitting to address as many of these histories as is possible.This project is divided into two major sections, one on the Dominican Republic and one on Puerto Rico, with a general and theoretical introduction that frames the work within Critical Race Theory and both Caribbean and Latino/a literary studies. The history of Spanish colonialism and a general denial and/or denigration of the African component to the ethnic heritage of these communities results in a construction of race based on a color-continuum model, rather than a binary model; this racial schema, along with Dominican and Puerto Rican concerns with whiteness, skin tone, and &quot;European&quot; phenotypic features, and their denial/denigration of an African heritage, shapes and influences the works of Dominican writers Julia Alvarez, Junot DÃ­az, Nelly Rosario, Angie Cruz, Loida Maritza PÃ©rez, and Annecy BÃ¡ez, and Puerto Rican writers Rosario FerrÃ©, Ana Lydia Vega, Mayra Santos-Febres, Esmeralda Santiago, Judith Ortiz Cofer, Piri Thomas, and Edgardo Vega YunquÃ©. The project concludes by drawing connections between Dominican and Puerto Rican experiences and supposing possible impacts of the growing Latino/a population on the racial and cultural makeup of the United States.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Community colleges in the United States serve a vital educational role in job training, preparation for transfer to a four-year institution, granting academic degrees and certificates as well as offering opportunities for personal growth and development.  Persistence has traditionally been measured by degree completion or by transfer rates.  However, students who enter community college with other goals may successfully meet their goal while not reaching traditional persistence milestones.  To date, much of the research on persistence has either focused on traditional students at four-year institutions, or on demographic risk factors among community college students.  Little has been done to evaluate the interrelationships between behavioral variables thought to influence community college student persistence.The purpose of this study was to use a national longitudinal dataset to evaluate a structural model integrating of the effects of behavioral variables associated with student motivation along with mediating factors that influenced community college students as they persisted toward their individual goals.  The initial goal was to establish a measurement model for the specified latent variables.  The second step involved an analysis of a structural model to establish relationships among the latent variables and endogenous variables.  The model was found to describe the community college student population of the BPS: 04/06 survey very well.Students&apos; combined cognitive ability, self-efficacy, and self-regulatory capacities do allow them to overcome external pull factors that have traditionally been shown to impede student persistence.  Students who have higher levels of cognitive abilities, self-efficacy, and self-regulation persist even though they may not feel integrated into the institution academically as indicated by faculty contact.  If a student is faced with the pull of outside employment and/or inadequate financial aid, is their capacity for self-regulation and their feelings of self-efficacy appear to enable the student to persist toward their goals.  The results of this study have shown that more than any other factor, motivation may indeed be the key to community college student persistence.  The results of this study serve to provide an alternative lens through which to view community college student persistence.   This viewpoint has not been extensively considered in the extant research literature up to this point.  The model presented in this study breaks from most traditional persistence models with the inclusion of psychosocial variables, and was found to be useful in identifying factors not commonly thought to be involved in student persistence.This study adds to the limited body of knowledge and addresses the gap in literature regarding differences in factors relating to persistence of community college students.  The findings should have important implications for research and instruction within the community college environment.  Such data could serve to reduce community college student attrition by: (1) aiding in the development of educational programs, (2) helping to develop institutional and public policy to sustain effective student support initiatives, and (3) target students, for whom specific policies should be developed to encourage persistence.  By considering how community college students&apos; needs and goals interact, federal, state, and college-level policy-makers might better consider how scarce resources may best be used to foster student success and persistence among the nation&apos;s fastest growing college sector.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>It has been projected that by 2020 one out of three children will originate from a culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) population (Rogers &amp; Lopez, 2002). Thus, school psychologists are called to reexamine and modify their service-delivery methods to better meet the needs of CLD populations (Guerrero &amp; Leung, 2008). The purposes of this study were: (1) to identify what a CLD problem-solving process looks like in the daily practices of school psychologists; (2) identify the impact of perceived value and skill level on the frequency of implementation practices of a CLD problem-solving model; and (3) identify if personal characteristics impact implementation practices of a CLD problem-solving model. Feedback from an expert panel was used to validate the content of a newly developed CLD problem-solving survey. An in-state procedural pilot study was conducted using a sample of state association members. The primary dissertation study was a revised version of the in-state procedural study using a larger, more representative sample of school psychologists identified in states with large CLD populations. Ratings for perceived value, skills level, and frequency of implementation practices were collected. Methods of analyses included: (1) item analyses; (2) descriptive statistics; and (3) multiple regression. A factor analysis was used to evaluate the underlying factors of the newly, developed CLD problem-solving process. Results are expected to better assist trainers with the improvement of professional development trainings related to CLD competencies of school psychologists.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Public education has experienced an unprecedented growth of diversity within the student population and accompanying that growth are inequities that are present in our schools and communities.  Many school teachers and administrators have a limited awareness of how their own class, gender, and race impact their work, and often, do not see how their views about others&apos; class, gender, and race help to reproduce the social hierarchy.  These limited or uneducated views may also contribute to the achievement gap that exists between students belonging to the minority and non-minority groups.It is important to study these views and ask whether educators are able to increase awareness of their own class, gender, and race and reflect on how their views and beliefs impact their teaching. This study employed a multi-site design to compare four public middle schools in Colorado on perceptions of cultural competency as well as investigating possible correlations between these perceptions and the disaggregated discipline data for each of the schools.While it was not possible to confirm a relationship was between the average school site score on the Cultural Proficiency Continuum and discipline referrals of Hispanic students the qualitative data illuminated the perspectives of the participating teachers regarding cultural proficiency and the classroom.  The qualitative data revealed significant negative perspectives held by the participants regarding the largest student group in the middle schools in the study.  The focus group data illuminated the perspectives of the teachers in this study as well as their perception of the effect race and culture have on the middle school classroom.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to develop and initially validate the Managerial Success Factors Inventory: Transportation Version (MSFI: TV), a scale generated to more accurately assess managerial competence in transportation than general managerial competence and leadership scales. The literature on managerial competencies, leadership, and the state of transportation management is summarized. Reigning models of general managerial competency were used with focus group and cognitive interview data to develop the scale. The conventional three-phase scale development research design was followed (exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and validation phases) by administering the instrument to a sample of 287 managers from a state Department of Transportation (DOT). The hypothesized 4 cluster-11competency general managerial competency model that the scale was based on could not be found in the exploratory factor analysis. Instead, a five-factor solution was most interpretable; problem solving, emotional competence, initiative, safety leadership, and integrity. This model was then confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis. A higher-order model was also confirmed indicating the measure can be treated as unidimensional. Rasch analysis confirmed these findings. The paper details the use of Rasch and structural equation modeling to analyze the psychometric properties of the scale. Implications for use of the scale in selecting, training, and promoting leaders in transportation and future research needs on the scale are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Few scales exist that assess social competence in children with Asperger&apos;s and high functioning autism (AS/HFA).  Due to the nature of the disorder, the current social competence measures that do exist are not designed to assess the social difficulties that many children with AS/HFA encounter.  To meet this challenge a scale was developed to better understand social competence in children with AS/HFA, the Children&apos;s Social Competence Scale (CSCS).  Two studies that report the development and initial validation of the scale were conducted with children between the ages of 3 and 8 with and without a diagnosis of AS/HFA.  First, an exploratory factor analysis of an initial item pool yielded three factors assessing subscales of social skills, self-esteem, and social-emotional regulation.  Second, a confirmatory factor analysis supported the CSCS three-factor structure.  Third, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and validity coefficients supported the viability, use, and potential for continued development of this new instrument.  Finally, significant differences were found for sex and for diagnosis in the social skills, self-esteem, and social-emotional regulation subscales.  Implications for theory and research on social competence in children are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Discovering Border Crossings in Pagan Epic Literature</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation argues that border crossings were important to the ancient Celts and Norse as evidenced by the vast quantity of occurrences in their literature,and have remained important themes in literature throughout the ages. Border crossings reflect man&apos;s fascination with concepts beyond his immediate existenceand understanding. His reactions to such inexplicable phenomena have provided inspiration to writers for hundreds of years. The investigation uncovers examples of border crossings in the epic stories captured in the &lt;italic&gt;Ulster&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Fenian Cycles&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;TheTÃ¡in&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;The Eddas&lt;/italic&gt;, and &lt;italic&gt;The Mabinogion&lt;/italic&gt;.Border crossings remain important for modern literary scholars to consider because they have not vanished. Although they are perceived differently, the concepts remain an integral part of our literary heritage. Analysis which implements border crossing themes explored in this work enables critics to employa new methodology for engaging with literature, enhancing subtleties and observing moods and tones which might otherwise go unnoticed and unappreciated.  Man&apos;s natural, instinctive continuing curiosity regarding the supernatural and mystery of the unknown provide a continuing thread of border crossing examples.The epics of Ireland, Iceland, and Wales establish the foundation and environment of Otherworld activity for the romance and gothic genres which follow. The beautiful fairy-woman who convinces a mortal to follow her into the Otherworld; the &quot;beheading&quot; game; witches and potions; castles hidden in mists - these themeswill be employed by later authors to define the mood and tone in works such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Macbeth, and Dracula.Stories of the supernatural have fascinated mankind since storytelling began and scholarly research in the area of border crossings must begin with the early epics. Pagan stories of border crossings have a very different view of the themes than works written in a Christian environment. This work examines border crossings in the environment where the people actually believed an Otherworldexisted as part of their own world. The research provides a baseline of border crossing themes and a reflection of how the ancients perceived them. This investigation is summarized with a look at the themes through the centuries, observing how border crossings have changed and evolved. Identifying the significance of border crossings in the early epics provides an insight into understanding where and how they are implicated in later literary works, and offersa view where scholars may continue to search for new literary border crossings. Such occurrences should be taken into account because identifying the continued presence of border crossings in hundreds of years of literature allows us to engage with these works in a new way, implementing a new analysis methodology to seekother worlds while broadening our reading experience.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The enterprise of comparison has been regarded by some as one of the most vital characteristics of a healthy academic study of religion. However, the failed legacy of Eliadian Comparativism has caused others to suggest that the art of comparison has not yet lived up to its promise. This study brings together the best tools of what the author calls &quot;Smithian New Comparativism.&quot; In order to demonstrate concretely a rigorous and responsible critical comparative analysis, and to chart a course for future academically beneficial cross-cultural comparisons, this project presents a case study that compares two religious traditions&apos; doctrinal responses to a conceptually analogous ontological presupposition. Specifically, it analyzes comparatively the Reformed Christian doctrine of limited atonement and the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist doctrine of akunin shoki. The comparative examination of these teachings illuminates the respective traditions&apos; doctrinally divergent responses to a common understanding of the human predicament, reveals previously unseen structural and conceptual parallels between the traditions by examining deeply-rooted Western ideas through the lens of Buddhist theories, and suggests finally that despite the appearance of surface resemblances between Shin Buddhist and Reformed Christian thought the two religious paths lead ultimately to differing religious ends.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>As world communication, technology, and trade become increasingly integrated through globalization, multinational corporations seek employees with global leadership experience and skills.  However, the demand for these skills currently outweighs the supply.  Given the rarity of globally ready leaders, global competency development should be emphasized in higher education programs.  The reality, however, is that university graduate programs are often outdated and focus mostly on cognitive learning.  Global leadership competence requires moving beyond the cognitive domain of learning to create socially responsible and culturally connected global leaders.  This requires attention to development methods; however, limited research in global leadership development methods has been conducted.  A new conceptual model, the global leadership development ecosystem, was introduced in this study to guide the design and evaluation of global leadership development programs.  It was based on three theories of learning and was divided into four development methodologies.  This study quantitatively tested the model and used it as a framework for an in-depth examination of the design of one International MBA program. The program was first benchmarked, by means of a qualitative best practices analysis, against the top-ranking IMBA programs in the world.  Qualitative data from students, faculty, administrators, and staff was then examined, using descriptive and focused data coding.  Quantitative data analysis, using PASW Statistics software, and a hierarchical regression, showed the individual effect of each of the four development methods, as well as their combined effect, on student scores on a global leadership assessment.  The analysis revealed that each methodology played a distinct and important role in developing different competencies of global leadership.  It also confirmed the critical link between self-efficacy and global leadership development.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Teachers are at the frontline of education and student learning; districts and schools are investigating innovated, yet cost-effective, ways to positively address organizational variables such as job satisfaction and immediate intent to stay.  The implementation of employee health and fitness program could be a relatively simple way to not only address these issues but also positively impact the health and overall well-being of all employees.  Even with the supporting research regarding employee health and fitness programs, gaps and contradictions still exist; future research is necessary in order to draw conclusions regarding program value and justification.  The present study therefore sought to contribute to the knowledge base regarding the correlation between employee health and fitness programs and job satisfaction and intent to stay in the public school settings.  A number of district level directors and school level principals from public school districts in the state of Colorado completed an electronic questionnaire regarding the existence of an employee health and fitness program, details about such a program, reasons for sponsoring or not sponsoring such a program and whether or not incentives are linked to such a program.  Descriptive statistics and correlations were computed to test several hypotheses.In general, employees in districts and school sites that sponsor employee health and fitness programs seem to have higher job satisfaction than those who work in district and/or school sites that do not sponsor such programs.  There was no correlation between a sponsored employee health and fitness program and immediate intent to stay in education.  School districts that sponsor health and fitness programs seem to have higher job satisfaction than employees of school sites that sponsor health and fitness programs.  School districts and school sites that sponsor employee health and fitness programs have found a valuable way to impact job satisfaction among their employees.  These findings have important implications for school districts and school sites considering sponsoring and implementing a health and fitness program for their employees.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Response to Intervention framework is an effective means for or of identifying Specific Learning Disabilities.  This study examined one school&apos;s utilization of the framework in meeting the needs of a continuum of learners from those who struggle to those in need of advanced options.  A case study format was utilized, involving an elementary school in a suburban school district in Colorado.  Through classroom observations, teacher interviews and dialogue with the site&apos;s Problem-Solving Team, principal, and a focus group, the Response to Intervention framework proved to be an effective model in meeting the needs of all learners.  In addition, the RtI framework was used at this site as a more inclusive approach for identifying and serving gifted learners than traditional identification methods. The findings of this study have important implications with regard to instructional practices in general, as well as in gifted identification and programming practices.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the convergent validity between a third-party rating scale of executive function (EF) and a task-performance measurement of EF; examined the effects of age, gender, and dual language experience on preschool children&apos;s EF skills (inhibition, working memory (WM), and shifting) and on early mathematical skills; and investigated the contributions of inhibition, WM, and shifting to early mathematical skills. Ninety-two children attending Head Start were assessed. Correlation analyses revealed a number of relationships between the EF rating scale and the EF task-performance measure. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed a main effect of age on all EF measures and the math assessment and a significant difference between language groups on the measures of inhibition and shifting. Finally, hierarchal regression analyses revealed that WM and inhibition made unique contributions to children&apos;s early mathematical skills, and vocabulary scores made more contribution to early mathematical skills than either inhibition or WM. These findings extend previous research by (a) highlighting the issues involved with the assessment of EF in young children; (b) further supporting findings of preschool age-related changes in EF; (c) demonstrating EF differences with a DLL population; and (d) highlighting the importance of WM, inhibition, and language to mathematical learning, demonstrating the effects in early childhood. Implications of these findings for EF assessment in young children and prekindergarten curricula are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The national principal shortage caused by the competing factors of an aging workforce, along with recent changes to the role expectations of the principalship making the position less desirable to potential candidates have been well documented in recent years.  Effective schools research shows that principals are second only to classroom teachers in having a positive impact on student achievement.  Traditionally, new principals come from the ranks of current teachers.  This study explores the motivating and inhibiting factors that educators consider when deciding to pursue the principalship.A web-based survey was administered to teachers in a large school district with urban, suburban, and rural schools and 196 responses were analyzed.  The data from this study suggest the primary motivating factors to pursue the principalship are; the desire to make a positive difference for others, the ability to influence or improve a school, instructional leadership, the ability to initiate change, professional challenge, higher salary, developing and implementing a vision for school improvement, the desire to be a leader, personal challenge, and job opportunities for the future or movement along a career path.  The primary inhibiting factors are; the amount of stress, the politics of the position, working with parents in negative or contentious situations, bureaucracy, the impact on family life or family responsibilities, the distance from the classroom or student contacts, the length of the work day, the length of the work week, accountability for student achievement, and the amount of responsibility.  These results are consistent with Hertzberg&apos;s Motivation-Hygiene Theory, which states that motivating factors are primarily intrinsic and inhibiting factors are primarily extrinsic.  Additionally, this study showed relationships between other factors and motivation to pursue the principalship.  Specifically, encouragement by others, participation in a leadership role, and possession of a principal&apos;s license were all linked to increased interest in the principalship.  Finally, recommendations are offered to districts and higher education regarding ways that they can mitigate or address the factors surrounding the principal shortage.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Family systems providing informal care and support to their aging relatives, who were residing in assisted living systems and receiving formal care were central to this study. A broader understanding of family involvement, with respect to exploring both care-receiver and caregiver roles and relationships, within the regulatory and environmental context of assisted living was sought through a qualitative research process. This study employed a phenomenological approach to conduct in-depth interview sessions with eight pairs of participants, comprising elderly residents in five assisted living facilities and their respective caregiving family members, typically a daughter or son and, in one case, a close friend, all of whom were personally interviewed. A total of 16 participants were interviewed individually. The three dominant themes that emerged from care-receivers and their caregiving relatives&apos; experiences, which characterized and impacted their family involvement, were (1) Coping efforts and attitudes that characterize the aging, the care-receiving, and the caregiving processes; (2) Enduring and changing roles and relationships in family systems; and (3) The paradox of institutional long-term care, as it created both relief and stress for elderly care-receivers&apos; and their caregivers in family systems. A systems/ecological framework is applied to explicate these findings, and policies pertaining to assisted living, and their economic implications for the long-term care process are also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study explored the differences in experiences of social class identity dissonance between first-generation college students and non-first-generation college students. Additionally, this study aimed to examine the effect of social class identity dissonance on psychological distress in first-generation college students, as well as, whether an anti-social dominance orientation partially buffers the relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress.A total of 1,109 college students from two local, four-year institutions participated in the study. The first research objective was to examine the differences between first-generation college students and non-first-generation college students on reported levels of social class identity dissonance. The next objective was to investigate whether social class identity dissonance mediates the relationship between generation status and psychological distress. The last objective was to explore whether having an anti-dominance orientation helps buffer the relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress. An independent samples t-test and hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the three hypotheses.A number of important findings were revealed by the results of the study. There appeared to be a significant, positive relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress. As social class identity dissonance increases in individuals, symptoms of psychological distress also increase. Additionally, social class identity dissonance was a significant predictor of psychological distress. No significant differences were seen between first-generation college students and their peers in this sample, and there did not appear to be a significant relationship between generation status and psychological distress, therefore, hypotheses one and two were rejected. Furthermore, social dominance orientation did not significantly moderate the relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress; thus, the third hypothesis was also rejected.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This work addresses how traditions associated with canon law of late medieval international society granted authority to myriad polities in fifteenth and sixteenth century questions of societal governance. In international relations, the late medieval period has rarely been given much attention; scholars have argued that the late medieval period is too &quot;local&quot; of an event to be considered within broader historical discussions of international societies and systems. This, however, is highly ironic considering that late medieval international society saw itself in universalist terms. It is precisely because late medieval international society was founded upon universalism, but organized on the basis of particular polities that it is such a valuable resource for understanding modern international society.I provide a historical narrative of the process in which a &quot;tradition of canonical status&quot; developed and allowed multiple political actors to all claim authority based upon the same universal foundations; this &quot;tradition of canonical status&quot; is understood as the set of historical practices, norms and ideas--starting as early as the second and third centuries--that allowed the formal system of canon law to develop in the twelfth century. I argue that it did not disappear with the inception of a formal legal system, but rather its customary practices took place in the context of the new legal system. The narrative then explains how this tradition of canonical status was brought into the Reformations era--which is  periodized here as 1414-1563--and in doing so it illustrates the traditional character of the period, which runs counter to both historians&apos; and IR scholars&apos; renditions of the era as a sharp break from the past.In international relations, this sharp break is associated with the emergence of the modern nation-state and sovereign territoriality. This work instead argues that myriad polities continued to base their authority on the tradition of canonical status, which I demonstrate through a discussion of outcomes at societal congresses. Specifically, in the fifteenth century, the predominant theme was the debate regarding conciliarism--the school of thought that viewed the council as potentially the highest societal authority--while the sixteenth century, or the period of confessionalization, was dominated by discussions of documenting discordant understandings of previously shared practices. Out of these historical processes arose the &quot;invention of religion&quot;: before the sixteenth century, the religious and the political were inseparable, while after this religion and politics became distinct but interdependent. Their continuing interdependence informs an understanding of the gradual, but not inevitable process towards modern international society based on territoriality.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer and accounts for 30 - 35% of all cancers in children. Significant improvement in the treatment of pediatric ALL has been achieved in recent years. Only 50 years ago, the disease was uniformly fatal with an Overall Survival (OS) rate &lt; 5%.  Modern-day, multi-drug chemotherapy is associated with an overall survival rate over 80%. Standard-risk ALL comprises the majority of ALL with an overall survival approaching 90%. Despite this success, children who relapse from this disease accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths in children. The backbone of treatment protocols have incorporated somatic but not host genetic features in the treatment regimens. The current study examined 12 genetic polymorphisms affecting the pharmacodynamics of antileukemic drugs in an attempt to identify biologic markers related to the risk of disease relapse.In the current research program, 125 standard-risk ALL patients who were treated at The Children&apos;s Hospital were enrolled in a retrospective study. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms and risk of disease relapse in this study cohort. The GSTM1 null genotype was associated with a decreased risk of disease relapse (HR = 0.394, 95% CI = 0.127 - 1.224, P = 0.107). A combination analysis of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes revealed a stronger association between the both the GSTM1 and GSTT1 normal genotype and an increased risk of leukemia relapse (HR = 2.73, 95% CI = 0.9 - 7.9, P = 0.063), compared with patients having either the GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotype. A &quot;drug exposure&quot; model was used in this study. The risk of relapse in individual with a low or intermediate &quot;drug exposure&quot; genotype increased 2.4-fold (HR = 2.39, 95% CI = 0.8 - 6.9, P = 0.107) compared with the high &quot;drug exposure&quot; genotype. No significant associations with relapse were observed for the CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, MTHFR C667T, MTHFR A1298G, or TYMS polymorphisms. The findings from this single institution study suggest that polymorphisms within genes of the GST superfamily may influence the treatment outcome in standard-risk ALL. They also point to the need of prospective, large multi-institutional studies to validate these findings prior to clinical implementation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation traces the emergence of the global human rights movement, investigates the role of popular culture as a vehicle for mobilization, and critically examines why the movement has failed to adequately politicize its supporters in the process. Beginning in the mid-1970s, a broad shift began to take place in which ordinary people were routinely confronted with human suffering, as conflict and crisis assumed a role as ritualized news events. The public response to these phenomena demonstrated a capacity for solidarity and engagement based on cosmopolitan premises. The inception of a collective ethos of compassion, an awareness of the other based on empathy, can be considered a symptom of globalization, of a moral variety, and is a byproduct of shifting economic trends, advances in technology, and efforts toward transnational organization. Support for human rights advocacy has gained traction as a mainstream social cause and provides a set of principles with which average people mediate the world and their role in it. Yet, this transformation did not occur spontaneously, but rather was deliberately cultivated by movement architects through a series of popular culture mechanisms. However, the methods and strategies deployed to enlist the public in defense of human rights shaped the substance of their engagement. This dissertation addresses the discrepancy between the political content of advocacy campaigns and the failure of the campaigns to politicize supporters, suggesting flaws in the foundation of the human rights movement. In order to set itself on a path toward relevance and effectiveness, the movement must inculcate political engagement, maintain an alignment of principle and action, and resist the seductive features of the age of consumerism.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Over the past decades there has been a great deal of research on developing high frequency micromechanical resonators. As the two most common and conventional MEMS resonators, piezoelectric and electrostatic resonators have been at the center of attention despite having some drawbacks. Piezoelectric resonators provide low impedances that make them compatible with other low impedance electronic components, however they have low quality factors and complicated fabrication processes. In case of electrostatic resonators, they have higher quality factors but the need for smaller transductions gaps complicates their fabrication process and causes squeezed film damping in Air. In addition, the operation of both these resonators deteriorates at higher frequencies.In this presented research, thermally actuated resonators with piezoresistive readout have been developed. It has been shown that not only do such resonators require a simple fabrication process, but also their performance improves at higher frequencies by scaling down all the dimensions of the structure. In addition, due to the internal thermo-electro-mechanical interactions, these active resonators can turn some of the consumed electronic power back into the mechanical structure and compensate for the mechanical losses. Therefore, such resonators can provide self-Q-enhancement and self-sustained-oscillation without the need for any electronic circuitry. In this research these facts have been shown both experimentally and theoretically. In addition, in order to further simplify the fabrication process of such structures, a new controlled batch fabrication method for fabricating silicon nanowires has been developed. This unique fabrication process has been utilized to fabricate high frequency, low power thermal-piezoresistive resonators. Finally, a new thermal-piezoresistive resonant structure has been developed that can operate inside liquid. This resonant structure can be utilized as an ultra sensitive biomedical mass sensor.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Identifying Quality Mentoring Based On New Teacher Perceptions of Professional Development</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Despite the fact that new teacher mentoring had its inception in the late 1960&apos;s and is currently mandated in schools and districts across the country, there are still questions as to whether effectiveness has been obtained (Keay, 2007).  Stewart (2004) arrived at a definition of &quot;quality mentoring&quot; based on five areas of support (i.e., Personal Support, Classroom Support, Professional Support, Evaluative Support, and Reflective Support), and her research provides definition to the kind of support that mentees desire and need.The purpose of this study was to examine an existing survey that was designed for a large urban district&apos;s evaluation of a grant-funded teacher-mentoring program (i.e., the New Teacher Support Program).  The researcher coded the existing program evaluation survey according to Stewart&apos;s categories, and this process identified the presence of research-based categories within the existing evaluation of a mentoring program.  The researcher then analyzed the results from the two groups of new teachers involved in this study, the New Teacher Support Program participants (NTSP) and the Non-New Teacher Support Program participants (Non-NTSP), to understand which components of mentoring were the most important to the mentees based on their perceptions.The findings from this study were that all survey respondents perceived that they received support from their mentors.  All survey respondents perceived more support in the Personal Support category, followed very closely by the categories of Professional Support, Classroom Support and Reflective Support.   The existing survey contained items that corresponded to all of Stewart&apos;s categories except Evaluative Support.  There were differences between the responses of the two groups (i.e., the NTSP and non-NTSP participants) especially in the category of Reflective support.  There was also evidence that the mentees used the support received from their mentors to adjust their instructional practices.The findings demonstrate that the new teachers in one urban school district did perceive support from having a mentor.  More research should be conducted regarding how support from mentors translates into improved instruction and student outcomes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Currently there is an increasing focus on teacher quality in educational reform, a lack of empirical research on exactly what culturally responsive teaching looks like, and a great deal of confusion on how teacher dispositions may be important in education. This study seeks to examine what great teachers believe, intend, and do while examining their dispositions in the process.Three research questions guided this study: 1) What are the intentions and beliefs of culturally responsive teachers? 2) How does culturally responsive teaching operationalize? 3) What are the dispositions of culturally responsive teachers? To respond to these questions, I use Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship, a qualitative research method developed by Eliot Eisner (1998). Educational criticism is comprised of four dimensions: description, interpretation, evaluation, and thematics.The findings suggest that there are similarities in the intentions, beliefs, operations, and dispositions of culturally responsive teachers. However, it was readily apparent that culturally responsive teaching operationalized differently for different teachers, leaving us to recognize that we cannot simply give teachers a checklist to ensure that great teaching manifests. Further, the study revealed that while the participants sought to reach the aims of what many culturally responsive scholars seek, they are confused by the label resulting in unintended consequences. This leads to the suggestion of evolving the label culturally responsive pedagogy to personalized pedagogy. Finally, the study recognizes the controllable and uncontrollable contexts of education. This has broad sweeping ramifications for policymakers and administrators, as they must recognize in their hunt for identifying what quality teachers do, there are a number of elements outside of teachers&apos; control that affect students&apos; educations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has consistently shown that approximately 40% of American students cannot read at grade level. In fact, most of these 40% of students read considerably below grade level. Unfortunately, these results have remained consistent in spite of reports such as the Nation at Risk in 1983 that first alerted everyone to the severity of the problem and provided remedies on how it could be remedied. The Nation at Risk Report was the impetus for a plethora of educational reform enactments at the federal level such as George H. Walker Bush&apos;s education summit in 1989, Goals 2000, the No Child Left Behind Act and the latest reform measure Race To The Top. In addition, states have enacted their own proficiency standards for student knowledge in reading. Several reading experts such as Louisa Moats and Louise Spear-Swerling have written reading standards that teachers should know to teach reading. The Common Core Standards have been adopted by at least 41 states that outline best reading practices and the International Reading Association has also developed reading standards.

The reading wars have also been a contributory factor to the poor reading scores. The reading wars pitted the whole language advocates against the phonics adherents. When the National Reading Report (2000) and the National Research Council Report (1998), released their results that reading instruction should include phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension, the reading wars were thought to be over. However, this has not been the case.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether a consensus exists for best reading practices among reading experts. Seven reading experts were interviewed and six of the participants agreed that reading instruction should include the five components: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. The seventh participant agreed that reading instruction contains the five components, however, the main component to teach reading is comprehension. The results have implications for developing a standard of care for reading (reading standards that can be adopted nationally) and the instruction of new teachers by universities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>At a time when institutions of faith are increasingly confronted with scandals that have brought the vulnerability of young children to the fore of religious consciousness, some scholars have pointed to Jesus&apos; special concern and affection for children in the Gospels. Scholars are struck by how often the authors place Jesus in relation to children: healing them, blessing them, and challenging their marginal status by characterizing them as models for understanding the kingdom of God proclaimed by Jesus. If the authors had concluded their stories of Jesus&apos; eschatological gathering with the blessing of the children, then their characterizations of children might seem nearly unparalleled. Yet, the narratives continue; children appear less; Jesus and the disciples move on.This work challenges the extent to which our long held interpretation that `Jesus loved the little children&apos; is well grounded in the gospel narratives. Instead, it is argued that the inclusion of young children in the kingdom of God presented in the Synoptic narratives is tempered by images of household disruption and alienation of children as a consequence of Jesus&apos; eschatological gathering of followers. Assuming the multivocality texts, a deconstructive literary approach is applied to the Synoptic Gospels, foregrounding children over other characters in relation to Jesus&apos; adult ministry. Passages such as healing narratives involving children, the `Child in the Midst&apos; (Mark 9:36-37 and par.), `One of These Little Ones&apos; (Mark 9:42 and par.), and `Let the Little Children Come to Me&apos; (Mark 10:13-16) are examined against sayings relativizing family ties and the lifestyle indicative of the radical call to discipleship in the Synoptic narratives. This work seeks not to resolve but to highlight the tensions between attempts at child inclusivity and the radical demands of discipleship on families.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study is an assessment of whether a language acculturation discrepancy (LAD) within families is most predictive of emotional and behavioral problems for Latina/o youth when relevant variables are controlled. A sample of predominantly Mexican American parent-child dyads was recruited to complete a language-based measure of acculturation and parent participants completed an assessment of their child&apos;s emotional and behavioral functioning. Results indicated a total difference value between parent-child levels of language acculturation to be most predictive of the outcome.  Additionally, the child&apos;s level of language acculturation, independent of that of the parent, was also found to account for a significant amount of variance.  Results indicate support for the acculturation gap-distress hypothesis based on discrepancies in language use and proficiency.  Limitations of the findings and directions for future research are also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Obesity is on the rise in the United States and reality television has also risen to the charge of representing fatness. More to Love was the first reality competition dating show to afford fat women a chance at reality show love. The purpose of the study was to look at how fat women are portrayed on reality competition dating shows. The purpose of this study is to understand how the mythic narrative of love through a feminist lens informed by LeBesco, Bordo, Hill Collins, and hooks are in conversation with each other in More to Love. This study found that the women were written into a fairy tale where they were afforded no ownership in their story. The bachelor, Luke, and their fatness controlled their destinies and their &quot;happily-ever-afters.&quot; Their identity was portrayed through their fatness, gender, and sexual orientation over any other identifying markers. The relationships with Luke and with food were found to be the main relationships evident. The study found that the show is unsuccessful in normalizing fat women as equally afforded the myth of love as thin women. It proliferates the totalizing of the identity of fat while minimalizing any other identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Despite the progress that has been made in revolutionary theorising over the past few years, most theorists of social change continue to neglect the influence of opposition leaders upon the revolutionary process. One of the few exceptions in this regard is Max Weber. In his analysis of legitimate authority, Weber asserts that the charismatic form of authority rests on popular devotion to the normative order ordained by a specific person at a time of crisis.Though his work offers some important insights into the revolutionary process, Weber fails to take into account the conditions that give rise to such forms of authority in the first place. This is why the state-in-society approach is so important. It analyses the interactions of multiple sets of formal and informal groups that promote different conceptions of political order. The focus here is not so much on whether a state provides opportunities for people to act, but how the practices of states generate justifiable collective grievances and ideologies in the first place.This is significant because revolutionary theorising needs to recognise the processes by which states influence the identities and ideas of various opposition groups in society. Where state practices contend with very different forms of social behaviour, people tend to be drawn into revolutionary movements because they are inspired by the vision of those who offer an escape from the unjust practices of the state. As we will see, this was certainly true in Cuba and Iran, where Fidel Castro and Ayatollah Khomeini came to assume paramount roles in revolutionary movements committed to very different forms of socio-economic justice.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis addresses several problems in the facility location sub-area of computational geometry.  Let &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt; be a set of&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; points in the plane.  We derive algorithms for approximating &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt; by a step function curve of size &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;n&lt;/italic&gt;, i.e., by an &lt;italic&gt;x&lt;/italic&gt;-monotone orthogonal polyline &lt;italic&gt;R&lt;/italic&gt; with &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;n&lt;/italic&gt; horizontal segments.  We use the vertical distance to measure the quality of the approximation, i.e., the maximum distance from apoint in &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt; to the horizontal segment directly above or below it.  We consider two types of problems: min-&lt;italic&gt;epsilon&lt;/italic&gt;, where the goal is to minimize the error for a given number of horizontal segments &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;/italic&gt;and min-#, where the goal is to minimize the number ofsegments for a given allowed error &lt;italic&gt;epsilon&lt;/italic&gt;. AfterO(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;)preprocessing time, we solve instances of the latter in O(min{&lt;italic&gt;klog n, n&lt;/italic&gt;}) time per instance.We can then solve the former problem in O(min{&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;nklog n&lt;/italic&gt;}) time.Both algorithms require O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;) space.The second contribution is a heuristic for the min-&lt;italic&gt;epsilon&lt;/italic&gt; problem that computes a solution within a factor of 3 of the optimal error for &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;/italic&gt; segments, or with at most the same error as the &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;/italic&gt;-optimal but using &lt;italic&gt;2k - 1&lt;/italic&gt; segments.  Furthermore, experiments on real data show even better results than what is guaranteed by the theoretical bounds.  Both approximations run in O(&lt;italic&gt;nlogn&lt;/italic&gt;) time and O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;) space.Then, we present an exact algorithm for the weighted version of this problem that runs in O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;) time and generalize the heuristic to handle weights at the expense of an additional &lt;italic&gt;logn&lt;/italic&gt; factor.  At this point, a randomized algorithm that runs in O(&lt;italic&gt;nlog&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;)expected time for the unweighted version is presented.  It easily generalizes to the weighted case, though at the expense of an additional logn factor.  Finally, we treat the maximinproblem and present an O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;3&lt;/super&gt;&lt;italic&gt;logn&lt;/italic&gt;) solution to the problem of finding the furthest separating line through a set of weighted points.  We conclude with solutions to the ``obnoxious&quot; wedge problem:  an O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;&lt;italic&gt;logn&lt;/italic&gt;) algorithm for the general case of a wedge with its apex on the boundary of the convex hull of S and an O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;) algorithm for the case of the apex of a wedge coming from the input set S.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A mixture of different mtDNA molecules in a single sample is a significant obstacle to the successful use of standard methods of mtDNA analysis (i.e., dideoxy dye-terminator sequencing). Forensic analysts often encounter either naturally occurring mixtures (e.g., heteroplasmy) or situational mixtures typically arising from a combination of body fluids from separate individuals. The ability to accurately resolve and interpret these types of samples in a timely and cost efficient manner would substantially increase the power of mtDNA analysis and potentially provide valuable investigative information by allowing its use in cases where the current approach is limited or fails. Therefore, this research was aimed at developing a strategy for the use of Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) as a developmentally-validated forensic application for resolving mixtures of mtDNA. To facilitate the adoption of this technology by the forensic community, a significant effort has been made to ensure that this technology meets the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) developmental validation criteria and interfaces smoothly with previously validated methods of forensic mtDNA analysis. To do this, the method developed using DHPLC employs mtDNA amplicons, PCR conditions and DNA sequencing protocols validated for use in forensic laboratories. These factors are essential in implementing DHPLC analysis in a forensic casework environment and for the admissibility of DHPLC and Linkage Phase Analysis in court.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Modeling social participation as predictive of life satisfaction and social support: Scale or index?</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Social participation in late adulthood through activities such as volunteering with charities, playing sports, and joining clubs can increase life satisfaction, directly by providing enjoyable engagement and indirectly by increasing a person&apos;s sense of social connectedness. When reported levels of different types of activities are used to measure social participation, conventional measure development procedures based on classical test theory lead to a proliferation of small participation subscales that don&apos;t show good reliability, don&apos;t have theoretical power, and don&apos;t match researchers&apos; conceptions of the dimensions of participation. Based on the poor performance of conventional approaches, some researchers have suggested that social participation should be modeled as an index composed of its indicators rather than as a scale in which indicators reflect an underlying latent factor. Typical approaches in psychosocial research rely on reflective-indicator models, which correspond to scale development, rather than incorporating composite variables with causal indicators. The latter approach, where manifest indicators are specified as causing the unobserved construct, is sometimes known as formative measurement, since the construct of interest is formed by its indicators. This study compared a scale model of social participation based on reflective measurement to an index model based on formative measurement.Using a sample representative of community-dwelling U.S. adults over age 65 from the Health and Retirement Study&apos;s 2008 wave of data collection, two alternative measurement models of participation were constructed using sixteen items that recorded frequency of participation in different activities. Because patterns of participation differed for males and females, gender-specific models were developed. The scale models assigned participation items to subscales based on item intercorrelations. The index model assigned items to participation composites based on predictive associations with the outcomes of social connectedness and life satisfaction.The index construction process led to a unidimensional representation of participation, composed of six of the original sixteen participation activity items. The initial attempts to build a scale model led to structures with many small factors and poor predictive validity. Based on the findings of unidimensionality for the index model, a single-factor scale model was explored for female respondents only. Results showed that both index and scale approaches have the potential to produce participation models that are parsimonious, well-fitting, and externally valid even though conventional scale development rules-of-thumb and current conceptions of the domains of participation lead the researcher to non-parsimonious, poorly-fitting solutions lacking predictive capability.Participation measurement instrument developers often theorize the existence of three or more dimensions of participation. Whether they use conventional (reflective indicator) or more radical (formative indicator) models, they are advised, based on this study&apos;s results, to evaluate a single-dimensional structure among their candidate models.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study gathered data from 147 employees in two U.S. headquartered multinational manufacturing companies. Participants responded to questions about their work-related values, perceptions of the productivity of their work teams, and the degree of operational integration between firms&apos; foreign affiliate offices and their U.S. based headquarters. Additionally, analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between team productivity and psychic distance, which is a measure of country-level cultural differences. Work values were assessed using The Values Scale (Neville &amp; Super, 1989), perceptions of team productivity were assessed used an instrument by Kirkman and Rosen (1999), degree of operational integration was measured using a set of items developed by Slangen (2006), and psychic distance was assessed using a scale created by Hakanson and Ambos (2010). As expected, work values were found to be different between a firm&apos;s headquarters and a foreign office and work values predicted perceptions of team productivity when controlling for the age of the team. Psychic distance was found to predict team productivity when team age was controlled, and a more highly integrated degree of operational integration was found to relate to perceived productivity. Contrary to expectation, a significant interaction was not found to exist between work values, degree of integration, and psychic distance. However, a significant interaction was found between psychic distance and work values. Implications of the findings, limitation of the data, and directions for future research are also presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation seeks to understand the role of women as political actors in the rise of Islamo-nationalist movement in Palestine. Using a historical and ethnographic approach, it examines the changing opportunity structures available to Palestinian women in the nationalist struggle between 1987 and 2007. It looks into the sites of political engagement of Palestinian women as mothers, organizers and political candidates, suicide bombers, and nonviolent activists with attention paid to the evolution of the Islamist ideology within these four pathways for political participation. The goal of this work is to engage the question of how some Palestinian women who appear to diverge from the commitments of feminist emancipatory visions are active participants in the Islamist transformation of the Palestinian nationalist struggle. In doing so, this dissertation seeks to unveil the evolution of gender relations within the Palestinian nationalist struggle while providing a deeper analysis of the emergence and significance of the Islamist movement in contemporary Palestinian society. It makes an interdisciplinary contribution to existing literature in nationalism and post-colonial studies, social movements, identity politics and feminist political thought in the Middle East.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using the General Theory of Family Communication Patterns (FCPT) and Emotion Regulation Theory (ERT) of Meta-emotion, Parenting, and Child Outcomes, this dissertation sought to investigate adults&apos; emotion socialization in their family of origin through an examination of multiple family schemata. Furthermore, the interactions of parental meta-emotions, family communication patterns, and family communication environments were investigated. Two surveys were used in this study. First, 228 adult-children across two universities in the western United States responded to items retrospectively describing the family communication patterns and family communication environments within their home of origin during their adolescence. Additionally, adult-children described the meta-emotion philosophies of their parents during the adult-child&apos;s adolescence. Analysis of the data revealed a positive association between emotion coaching (EC) and conversation orientation, as well as positive associations between emotion dismissing (ED) and both conversation and conformity orientations. In examining meta-emotion philosophies across FCP family types, unique interactions were observed across levels of EC, ED, conversation orientation, and conformity orientation. Notably, conversation and conformity orientations acted as reciprocal suppressor variables of ED within consensual families. Further, ED was undifferentiated across pluralistic, protective, and laissez-faire families. Levels of EC were undifferentiated between consensual and pluralistic families, and levels of EC were also undifferentiated between protective and laissez-faire families. Expressiveness and conflict avoidance were both predictive of EC, while all three family communication environments were predictive of ED. A second survey compared the perspectives of 63 adult-children recalling how they were parented against the perspectives of their primary caregivers recalling how they parented their child during adolescence. Adult-child and caregiver perspectives were undifferentiated in how they recalled levels of ED, however, caregivers recalled higher levels of EC than their adult-children. These results indicate the complexity of family schemata and how they influence family communication. Moreover, explaining levels of ED versus EC may be more complex than describing family expressivity or levels of interaction amongst family members. Lastly, the overall investigation of family schemata offers a unique description of family emotional environments. The implications of the results for FCPT, ERT, and family communication research, limitations, and directions for further research were also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) formerly known as domestic violence, is a chronic public health crisis affecting millions of women. Significant research has been generated related to the prevention and treatment of IPV; however, despite these efforts, there continues to be discrepancies in screening, referrals, and treatment of IPV which are compounded for ethnic minorities. Latinos are the fasting growing minority population in the United States, yet there continues to be a lack of public awareness and research related to Latina survivors of IPV. There are currently no studies exploring the subjective experience for Latina survivors of IPV in therapy.The objective of this study was to ascertain a culturally grounded understanding in Latina survivors of IPV perceptions of therapists&apos; cultural and IPV competence using a qualitative methodology. For this study, 10 Latina women over the age of 18 were selected, who self-reported experiencing IPV and who had participated in therapy for their IPV experience. Participants were recruited using flyers distributed in various community agencies, domestic violence shelters, and by Snowball sampling method. Each participant was interviewed twice and using a phenomenological methodology, structural and textural descriptions were generated and clusters of themes were identified from interview transcriptions.Findings in this study suggest that therapist characteristic&apos;s that allowed for a positive rapport was not necessarily related to their perceptions of their therapists&apos; cultural competence or competence in providing IPV counseling. Additionally, an ethnic match alone did not seem to compensate for cultural or IPV competence as expected. Themes generated from participant interviews identify specific behaviors perceived as Accepting Behaviors and Rejecting Behaviors. These themes provide valuable information on how culturally relevant interventions can be further enriched and developed in working with Latina survivors of IPV.In addition to themes generated from participant interviews, related to the proposed research questions, a number of contextual themes were identified. These themes provide a contextual framework for the cultural variables informing participant perceptions of therapy and the therapeutic alliance. They also provide valuable information on how cultural and socio-environmental factors deter Latina survivors of IPV from seeking treatment or disclosing IPV.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>While this research appears to be about horses and riding, it is really a project about the conditions of White women, White femininity, and feminist futurities. Driven by my investment in imagining possibilities of dismantling Whiteness and heteropatriarchy, this research begins to mark the dominant performances of White femininity and those fleeting moments of disruption by White women. My intentions for this project were to stage performances of feminist futurities that imagine feminist aesthetics as relational probabilities towards feminist alliances.The research was drawn from a six month critical performance ethnography of a local Hunter/Jumper barn. This critical performance ethnography was also informed by co-performative interviews, embodied cultural memory of my life long experiences within this community, and critical rhetorical analysis of vernacular discourses within the site to speak to and enlighten my ethnographic findings. My analysis was informed by my conceptualization of affective intersectionality.The research findings expose how White-supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy is served by White women and the possibilities within their performative disruptions of normative politics. The analysis reveals how the performance of class maintains affective qualities that discipline White femininity into serving White heteropatriarchy but these performances of White feminine elitist classism break the relational possibilities between horse and rider. The research locates the doings and undoings of White feminine civility when White women&apos;s bodies serve or disrupt normativity.Next, the relational aspects of the performance of riding render lessons in affective reasoning that reveals an embodied-communicative-performative space to deconstruct White femininity. Affective reasoning frames new forms of communication that are not beyond Whiteness but actually allots White women new means to negotiate the performance of White femininity. These potential feminist performatives challenges White capitalist heteropatriarchal binds on White women&apos;s bodies in order to engage with others.Finally, embodied feminist aesthetics best weaves these two analytical findings together to picture a culminating view of feminist futurities that stretch towards a horizon of feminist alliances. Embodying feminist aesthetics allots normative framings of power to become reshaped and perhaps remade. Feminist aesthetics stages utopian performatives that White women both can and should performatively engage in order to foster feminist futurities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The objective of the current study was to examine Relationship Satisfaction, Personal Commitment and Trust, and Perceived Partner Commitment and Trust among long-distance and proximally close dating relationships of graduate students.  The sample included graduate students in long-distance and proximally close dating relationships. The study found that Perceived Partner Commitment significantly predicted Personal Trust over and beyond Personal Commitment. Study results also indicate that Personal Commitment and Personal Trust significantly predicted Relationship Satisfaction, but that, Perceived Partner Commitment did not. Results also indicated that participants in short-term long-distance relationships reported higher levels of Personal Commitment than participants in long-term long-distance relationships. Results indicated there was no difference in Commitment based on which partner traveled more.  Finally, for long-distance participants, Visits Per Year (face-to-face contact) was not related to Personal Commitment, Personal Trust, Perceived Partner Commitment or Perceived Partner Trust. Future research examining the differences between long-distance and proximally close dating relationships, larger sample sizes, and random samples will help to contribute to the little that is known about these unique relationships.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explored several predictors of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in a sample of 169 breast, prostate and colorectal cancer survivors. The first aim was to determine the influence of Anxiety, Depression and Perceived Threat (defined as the combination of Life Outlook Threat, i.e., the degree a cancer diagnosis challenged a survivor&apos;s assumptive world, and Physical Threat, i.e., threat to mortality and physical well-being) in the prediction of Positive and Negative Cognitive Processing. The second aim was to examine the effect of Anxiety, Depression, Perceived Threat, and Positive and Negative Cognitive Processing in the predication of PTG.Cancer survivors who were treated at one of the Denver Division clinics of the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center participated in the study. Since little empirical research has been conducted utilizing the variable of cognitive processing in the psychological literature, the study sought to investigate how Anxiety, Depression, and Perceived Threat were related to Positive and Negative Cognitive Processing. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore four primary hypotheses.The results of the study revealed several important findings. Physical Threat, Depression, and Permanent After-Effects of Cancer Treatment significantly predicted Positive Cognitive Processing, with lower levels of Physical Threat and Depression and no After-Effects of Treatment predicting higher Positive Cognitive Processing. Life Outlook Threat, Positive Cognitive Processing, and Type of Cancer Treatment Received also significantly predicted PTG. The findings indicated that greater life outlook threat and positive cognitive processing as well as receiving more than one form of cancer treatment predicted greater growth. None of the variables reached significance in predicting Negative Cognitive Processing and Negative Cognitive Processing failed to significantly predict PTG.While perceived threat and cognitive processing have a strong theoretical basis in the emergence of growth, the constructs have received little empirical attention. This is the first study that has assessed how being diagnosed with cancer challenges, rather than alters, a survivor&apos;s assumptive world. The results of the study provide evidence that increases in life outlook threat and positive cognitive processing are related to PTG.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since traditional principal preparation programs were scrutinized for inadequately training 21st century principals, alternative principal programs were designed to prepare principals to improve the US educational system and student achievement. One particular innovative program, the Daly Leadership Program, was collaboratively developed between the Pintler School District and the Intrepid University. The Daly Leadership Program was not only designed to balance leadership theory and practice, but also to produce transformative leaders capable of to navigating a moral dimension and promoting second order change.The purpose of this study was to investigate the leadership style of graduates from the Daly Leadership Program that were employed by the Pintler School District. First, it was determined if the program graduates identified themselves as transformative leaders or leaders who have the capacity to make second-order changes. Then it was determined if program graduates serving as school principals were perceived as transformative by the teachers on their staff. The leadership style of graduates was measured using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire created by Bass &amp; Avolio to define leadership behaviors on a Full Range Leadership continuum from Laissez-Faire to Transactional to Transformational.The results revealed that Daly graduates perceived themselves to be transformative leaders at a higher rate than the national norms. Teachers who worked with program principals perceived their principals as transformative as well. However, principals perceived themselves more transformative than their teachers perceived them to be in the areas of intellectual stimulation (encourages innovative thinking), individual consideration (coaches people), and contingent reward (rewards achievement). In fact, teachers perceived their principals lower than national norms in these three factors, but higher than national norms for inspirational motivation (inspires others) and idealized influence (builds trust and acts with integrity).This study indicated that there was alignment between the goals of the program and the perceived leadership style of graduates. It also indicated that the context of formal leadership roles might impact the perceptions of principals and teachers regarding leadership style.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Children in foster care move two times per year on average.  School records are not always transferred in a timely manner, which leads to a lack of services.  Schools often are not aware of the legal issues surrounding foster care, such as who has legal rights to sign field trip permission slips or consent for educational evaluations.  This study led to the development of an informational guideline as to how best support the school transition process for children in foster care.  The Delphi technique was used to enlist the expertise of four respondent groups: foster parents, Guardians ad Litem, school psychologists, and social services workers.  Data was gathered in three rounds.  Round 1 gathered information the respondents believed to be pertinent when a foster child transitions schools.  Round 2 synthesized and formalized information gathered from Round 1, and asked respondents their level of agreement and suggestions for improvement.  Round 3 led to the development of an informational guideline to promote smooth school transitions for children in foster care for respondents to review and approve.  The end product was a refined informational guideline intended for schools to utilize when a child in foster care transitions schools so that the child and school are prepared for the transition in the best possible way.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Rebuilding Character: The Practices of Positive Youth Development Teachers in a Youth Correctional Setting</dc:title>

  <dc:description>&lt;bold&gt;Abstract&lt;/bold&gt;There is a worldwide call for alternatives to current systems focused on restorative justice.  The United States currently has a process but no plan in implementing effective programs for rehabilitating youth offenders.  For many years, the prevailing idea in youth corrections has been that nothing works as studies continued to have difficulty pinpointing effective programs. Yet, over the last several decades, prison populations have risen dramatically, as have penal housing costs.Positive Youth Development (PYD) offers a different framework focused on developing youth assets and promoting positive adolescent development.  Derived from research in behavioral sciences, PYD programs promote the development of the five C&apos;s: competencies, character, connection, confidence, and caring/compassion.  Three additional PYD elements are held in common: a focus on developing strengths instead of targeting deficits, the promotion of prosocial relationships, and the use of multiple contexts and environments for adolescent development.This study examines a unique Denver Public charter high school/ youth correctional program currently embracing PYD in Watkins, Colorado: Ridge View Academy.  The goal of the study is to answer four research questions regarding implementing PYD in a correctional facility: 1.What does Positive Youth Development look like in a correctional setting? 2. What are the intentions of a Positive Youth Development teacher in a correctional setting? 3. How are those intentions revealed in that teacher&apos;s practice?  4.  What is the significance of the theories and practices ofPositive Youth Development teachers in a correctional setting for education and society in general?  This study found common themes in each teacher&apos;s classroom in the intentional, structural, and curricular domains.  The research found commonalities in the teachers&apos; intentions when working with the adjudicated youth.In summary, PYD was found to be an appropriate and effective for framework for working with correctional youth.  Furthermore, the study found the teachers&apos; intentions to be a significant factor in their motivation to engage in their PYD practice and reach students.  The study suggests a need for further research into the system-wide PYD program at Ridge View Academy or at any other sites where PYD is used as a framework for developing at-risk adolescents.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Given the changing global environment and different experiences of the new immigrants, it is necessary to delve into the question of how the notions and patterns of immigration and assimilation change through the lens of transnational migration that focuses on the connection of immigrants to the context of both sending and receiving countries.  Recognizing the transnational religious activities and creative adaptations of the new immigrants to new environments can enrich the study of assimilation, which reflects the changing picture of multilayered American society and its constituents.  To examine the assimilation process of Korean immigrants through their transnational religious activities, my research examines both organizations and individuals seeking long-distance spiritual and practical guidance to negotiate identities in a new land and find meaning to their lives.  Rather than assuming the inevitable process of assimilation, this study of Korean immigrants&apos; assimilation under the influence of transnational engagements can provide a changing understanding of assimilation, which emphasizes dynamic and reciprocal adaptations between immigrants and both sending and receiving societies.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>SCHOOL REFUSAL BEHAVIOR: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF LATINO/A CHILDREN&apos;S EXPERIENCES</dc:title>

  <dc:description>School refusal behavior (SRB) is a subset of absenteeism in which children either altogether refuse to attend school or experience great difficulty remaining in class for the duration of the school day. Child motivated SRB is a growing problem that now affects between 5% and 28% of children and adolescents at some point during their lives.  The effects of SRB can extend well beyond the classroom. Long-term, SRB can lead to delinquency and psychiatric, occupational, and marital problems in adulthood. Additionally, children who consistently exhibit SRB are more likely to drop out of school, thereby limiting their career choices and their earning potential.Though there has been considerable research conducted with school refusing youth, studies examining the impact of environmental and contextual factors on SRB with Caucasian samples have been few and with Latino/a children have been nonexistent. Additionally, the research has shown that a significant number of school refusing youth do not meet criteria for a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers begin to look to external variables to garner an understanding of the factors that create and maintain SRB. The purpose of this studywas to gain a better understanding of the meaning and attributions children make of their school refusing behaviors.This study utilized a phenomenological design in which ten Latino/a children between the ages of 11 and 13 were interviewed on two separate occasions about their school refusal experiences. The students were asked open-ended questions about their relationships with peers, teachers, and family, as well as different facets of the school environment. All relevant statements from the interviews were categorized into themes in order to discover the essence of the experience.The interviews revealed each student faced multiple barriers to school attendance. In other words, their school refusal behaviors were impacted by many different factors. The co-researchers&apos; experiences were synthesized, and it was found that the most commonly endorsed factors concerned relationships, and their impact on SRB. Specifically, each child endorsed the quality of peer and teacher relationships as both being factors that heavily influenced his/her unwillingness to attend school. Other major themes that impacted the SRB of most participants were the way families viewed school attendance, children&apos;s support systems, relationships with parents, their experience of their schoolwork, and parental involvement. These and other findings highlight the systemic implications that need to address these concerns in order to better serve school refusing youth.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Serial Fictions: A Collection</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This collection of fiction that is not only a compilation of short stories, but a &quot;serial collection&quot;. That is, the stories are organized into series, and these series placed in a series as well, making up the book. The purpose of this organization is to figure out to what extent the arrangement of stories significantly contributes to the reader&apos;s understand of, and engagement with, the particular elements of each story as they are both replicated and modified within and throughout the series. If plot is, as E.M. Forster describes it, the narrative of events with an emphasis on causality, then this arrangement can show how plot can exist in varying forms. Specifically, it can disrupt the cause and effect rationale in favor of a more dynamic associative logic.In this collection, the first series of stories revolves around a set of characters, namely three sisters; the next around a single event, an abduction; and the third around a theme, the individual forging space in the social melee.Traditional story lines can oversimplify the correlative relationship between events--a single story line allows for a single answer--and ignore the complex interactions amongst characters, the stories that contain them, and the consciousness of the reader reading them. In Serial Fictions, aspects of the stories are interchangeable but not identical. The objective, then, is to require a different type of reader interaction than that most often required by the chronological structure; that is, one of participant rather than observer.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study tells the personal stories of three academically successful students of Mexican descent. The goal of this study was to give a counter to the stereotypical deficit view of Hispanic students in the eyes of teachers, parents, and other students.The participants were three high school students of Mexican descent attending an urban high school in Colorado. The research question of this study allowed the participants to tell their story of what it was like to be a student. The research question was: What are the personal and academic stories of academically successful Mexican urban high school students?Through in-depth interviews the students shared both their positive and negative experiences. The narratives revealed that each student had similar experiences. The study identified common experiences that became themes and through an analysis of the data, nine findings were identified: (listed alphabetically) adversity, college, discrimination friends/peer pressure, language barriers, parent/family support, pride, responsibility, and teacher support.By telling the stories of three successful students of Mexican descent, light will be shed on what helped these students become successful. These stories give the reader the opportunity to meet three students of Mexican descent though their stories of what it was like to be a student and to see how they were able to succeed and counter the narrative to the more commonly known deficit views of Hispanic students.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Survivor Song: The Voice of Trauma and Its Echoes</dc:title>

  <dc:description>For societies and cultures that experience mass torture and trauma, giving voice to the story of what happened is significant for both the specific individuals who have survived or witnessed the trauma, and the culture that is forced to process it and incorporate the experience into its collective identity. Testimonial literature that resulted from the detention and torture of desaparecidos under the military dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s and 80s, and the genocide of the Armenian people in 1915, reveals many different approaches in the ways that people write about torture and trauma. In attempting to find a voice to describe trauma, which is inherently indescribable, accounts range from factual histories to artistic endeavors intended to capture the truth of the experience being related. For many survivors, telling their stories is an act of resistance against the perpetrators&apos; attempts to silence them. Examining the voices of survivors and witnesses in the context of literary trauma theory and historiography allows the story itself to be considered in terms of the implications that it has for both those who tell it, and those who hear it. In the aftermath of trauma, the generations descending from the survivors are deeply affected by how the story of trauma has been transmitted through their families and cultures. It has powerful implications for both individual and collective identity, and this is vividly displayed in the gestures of memorialization, literature, and personal perspectives of those who live in post-traumatic cultures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation explores the rhetorical fragments in three case studies of the American Labor Movement constituting movement members in solidarity. Using Kenneth Burke&apos;s discussion of rhetorical substance, this project explores the possibilities for developing deep and broad forms of solidarity within the American Labor Movement. Rhetorical fragments of the Industrial Workers of the World, the United Farm Workers, and contingent faculty unionization efforts are explored.I argue Burke&apos;s ideas of substance and identification provide a powerful lens through which we can examine the solidary practices of social movements. Through the examination of the case studies mentioned, I demonstrate that solidarity was constructed using different points of identification for workers involved in the movement. These points of identification sometimes worked to the benefit and sometimes to the detriment of the movements described.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine the priorities of school principals in high poverty schools that have the potential to make the greatest impact on student achievement.   The study utilized secondary data analysis of a survey given to all Colorado educators to measure perceptions of school conditions, including leadership, along with school student achievement data.  The TELL (Teaching, Empowering, Learning and Leading) Colorado survey was administered online to educators.  The survey constructs were analyzed using Leithwood and Riehl&apos;s framework for effective leadership actions.  These actions include: setting direction, developing people, redesigning the organization and managing the instructional program.  The participants of the study are 167 schools designated by the state of Colorado as being high-poverty.   Data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential analyses. Schools were studied within two groups.  Schools identified as &quot;Centers for Excellence&quot; by the state of Colorado are designated high-poverty, high-growth schools.  A second, larger group of schools was classified as high-poverty, low-growth.  Leadership survey items were analyzed for both groups and comparisons made between the two.  Overall, results indicated that the higher perception of leadership within a school, the more likely the school was to be designated a `Center of Excellence&apos; by the state.â</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study utilized the ontological and epistemological foundations of critical realism posed by Margaret Archer (2000) to deepen social work&apos;s understanding of collaboration. Through the use of Danermark et al.&apos;s (2002) stages of explanatory research based on critical realism, the author found that agential and structural interactions of the Colorado Community Organizing Collaborative emerged. These findings illustrate that critical realism can be used in social work research to broaden the discipline&apos;s perception of human and environment. Archer&apos;s (2000) grounding of agency in three orders of reality, that practice is pivotal and morphogenesis is transformative aids in rediscovering how structure constrains or enables collaborative emergence.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Correlation Between Professional Learning Communities &amp; Collective Efficacy &amp; the Resulting Impact on Student Growth Data</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study in 2007 conducted by the National Center of Education Statistics revealed that the students in United States are scoring lower than several other countries in the areas of science and mathematics.  Students in other countries are able to compete globally for employment in professional occupations that were previously occupied by graduates from the United States.  Therefore, there is a sense of urgency to increase student achievement throughout the United States.  No Child Left Behind (2001) mandates that public schools develop accountability systems to ensure that all students achieve at the proficient or advance levels.  It goes further to mandate that school systems address achievement gaps between sub-groups.  Researchers have investigated the characteristics of effective schools in search of the solutions to address our student achievement gaps and achievement for all students.  Collective efficacy, the perception that a school has the capability to attain their goals, has been found to increase student achievement.  Likewise, research on effective learning organizations has also been found to increase student achievement.  There has been much research on each construct individually, however research on the relationships between these two constructs and the related impact on student achievement is beginning to emerge.This study investigates the correlation between teachers&apos; perception of collective efficacy and their school as an effective professional learning community and delving deeper to find a resulting relationship to student growth data.  Fourth and fifth grade teachers from a large suburban school district of 50, 000 students in the Denver Metro area participated in this study to assess whether there was a correlation between their level of perceived collective efficacy and their perception of their school as a professional learning community.  Roger Goddard&apos;s Collective Efficacy: Short Form questionnaire was used to assess collective efficacy.  Shirley Hord&apos;s School Professional Staff as Learning Community questionnaire was used to assess perceptions of learning communities.  Data from the Colorado Student Assessment Program of Spring 2009, student growth data specifically, was used to investigate correlations between student achievement to teachers&apos; perceptions of collective efficacy and learning communities.Analysis revealed that there is a positive correlation between collective efficacy and schools as professional learning communities.  The correlation was statistically significant at r= 476 p=.000.  Hord&apos;s questionnaire contains five dimensions of learning communities and four out of the five were found to be positively correlated to collective efficacy and were statistically significant.  However, the findings indicated that there was not a relationship between student growth data and collective efficacy or professional learning communities which was inconsistent with other studies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This pilot study undertook a mixed methods exploration of the interaction of art therapy and self-esteem in an adolescent eating disorder population.  Using therapeutic art books in a group format, adolescents created art about their feelings, their eating disorder, or whatever else they deemed important.  This art technique is relatively new and novel as an art therapy intervention.  Therefore, this study aimed to look at the technique&apos;s effectiveness at decreasing participants&apos; negative mood states and investigated the technique&apos;s ability to affect participants&apos; perceptions of their self-esteem.  Measures of global self-esteem and art therapy related self-esteem were measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Hartz Art Therapy Self-Esteem Scale, respectively.  In addition, the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) scale and visual analogue scale (VAS) of four negative mood states commonly found in individuals with eating disorders were also measured.  All participants were interviewed about their experience using the therapeutic art book technique at the conclusion of the study.  It was found that global self-esteem did not change over the four week study period.  Self-esteem related to art therapy trended upward, though still did not show statistically significant change.  The SUDS and VAS showed the greatest change after the first group session.  From participant interviews, four major themes were identified including art as distraction, significant difference from written journal, increased understanding of others, and art expressing more than words.  As this was a pilot study, future research ideas using this particular art therapy technique were presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Tyack &amp; Tobin (1994, p. 454) describe that the âgrammar of schooling,â like the shape of classrooms, has remained remarkably stable over the decades. This has frustrated generations of reformers who have fought to change standardized organizational traditions. Typically school reform has taken the form of innovations in education. Unfortunately, educational innovations don&apos;t usually last long or they were never truly innovations in the first place but rather a repackaging or reintroduction of age-old customary practices.The âEos Public Schoolsâ set out on a mission to integrate P-20 educational reform into its overall school system as a way to confront some longstanding 20th century practices and challenge the status quo. One way of accomplishing this was through the creation of a P-20 Educational Campus. Was the district, merely by their intentions and subsequent actions, able to truly innovate the way in which they conceptualized and reconceptualized schooling in the development of the P-20 Campus?  How did they âdo schoolâ differently? What specifically were the innovations and how significant were they?This study examined the conception and significance of specific innovations within the creation of the P-20 Educational Campus through case study methodology to tell the story of how this Colorado school district approached P-20 educational reform.  A mixed methods approach was used from a review of documents, interview responses combined with survey results. Serving as the conceptual framework for this case study, the key product (goods or services), process (production or delivery methods), organizational (organizational structures, practices, or methods), and marketing (design or packaging) innovations were illuminated.The research revealed the most significant innovations as the seamless, aligned P-20 Campus system, academic and career pathways, partnerships, and world languages. These significant innovations were accompanied by postsecondary and workforce readiness (PWR), new instructional technologies, the Campus leadership model, fluid movement of students, and plans of study.  Specific themes emerged through these innovations:  alignment and coherence, choice, connections, opportunities, partnerships, and 21st century learning.These findings will inform school reformers thinking about how to provide more instructional alignment and coherence toward a seamless, educational system from preschool through postsecondary experiences; to address PWR; and to create critical partnerships among P-12 education, higher education, and the community and industry.It is too soon to tell if these findings were enough to truly reshape the âgrammar of schooling.â  However, when considering innovations in education, these findings revealed the need for systemic structures to promote educational innovation for the 21st Century.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examines what effect the movement towards deeper economic and political integration in the EU has had on the domestic politics of a member country, Britain.  This study argues that this pressure to integrate by joining the single currency, or European Monetary Union (EMU), and its predecessor, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), has exacerbated the cross-cutting cleavages inherent in British party politics, making them potentially dangerous to party unity and to successful governance by making party management more challenging.  The pressure imposed by the EU on British parties and governments to follow the path of economic integration to its fullest extent exacerbates these cross-cutting cleavages in each time period examined in this study, forcing successive British politicians to seek an accommodation between pro- and anti-euro forces in their own parties.In particular this study examines two factors that condition British politicians&apos; reaction to the pressure to join the euro and the impact that the euro cross-cutting cleavage has had on the parties and on British government.  First, formal British political institutions, particularly the size of a ruling party&apos;s parliamentary majority but also the First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system, shape the range of decisions on euro policy available to a political actor.  Second, in keeping with the reiterated problem solving methodology employed in this study, this work considers the role of actors in managing the euro cross-cutting cleavages, especially prime ministers and/or party leaders and how they use their informal powers to manage their party.  Examining how these factors and their interaction with the EU-level integration pressure impacted the decisions Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair, and Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, made regarding euro policy provides insight into what range of options a future prime minister may enjoy when the pressure to integrate rises again.Finally, this work examines the broader repercussions of the EU impetus to deeper integration in other member countries currently struggling to balance the EU-level imperative of economic integration with domestic political realities.  The presence of euroskeptic countries such as Britain gives voice within the EU to alternatives to the dominant imperative to deeper integration whatever the cost.  Thus, Britain&apos;s protracted political agonizing over whether to join the euro has given the country a broader legacy in Europe by making the debate over economic and monetary union a more open and democratic one, allowing this &quot;reluctant European&quot; a key role in shaping the future of the European Union.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Shyness is associated with several emotional, social, and academic problems. While there are multiple difficulties that often accompany shyness, there appear to be some factors that can moderate negative effects of shyness. Research has demonstrated that certain parenting factors affect the adjustment of shy children in early childhood, but there is minimal research illuminating the effect of parenting factors in older age groups. The first purpose of this study was to examine relationships between shyness and loneliness, social anxiety, and school liking. The second purpose was to investigate whether the quality of the relationship between a parent and a 10- to 15-year-olds child influences the amount ofloneliness or social anxiety a shy child experiences or how the childfeels about school. Parent-child dyads served as participants andwere recruited from public and private middle schools and churchyouth groups in Colorado and Indiana. Child participants completedseveral self-report surveys regarding their relationship with a parent,shyness, loneliness, social anxiety, and their attitude toward school.Parents completed a survey about their relationship with their childand responded to questions related to their perceptions of theirchild&apos;s shyness. Data was analyzed with a series of correlation andregression analyses. Greater degrees of self-reported shynesswere found to be associated with higher levels of loneliness andsocial anxiety and less positive feelings about school. Due to aproblem with multicollinearity during data analysis, this study wasnot able to explore the effect of the parent-child relationship qualityon the associations between shyness and adjustment factors.Overall, these findings imply that shyness remains an importantissue as children approach adolescence. Further research isneeded to continue learning about the potential importance ofparent-child interactions in reducing maladjustment for shy childrenduring late childhood.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This quantitative study investigated student and faculty attitudes toward use of Digital Media Technology (DMT) at the University of Denver.  The purpose was to understand how and why students and faculty used DMT on campus. Uses and gratifications theory (Katz, Blumler, &amp; Gurevitch, 1974) was used as the theoretical model to interpret and understand Millennial college students&apos; DMT use, Langer and Knefelcamp&apos;s (2008) College student technology arc was used as a conceptual model. Two survey instruments were designed: one for faculty and one for students to collect data on DMT use and attitudes toward use, satisfaction, skill, and learning at DU.The survey reached 10,404 students, and 1,218 responded to the survey, Completed surveys totaled 1,033, which resulted in a response rate of 10%. The faculty survey reached 294 full, associate, and assistant professors on campus, and resulted in 20% response rate (n=59). Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, correlations, ANOVA, t-tests, and chi square. Nine factors emerged as relevant aspects of DMT use on campus (1) General use, (2) Use for learning, (3) BlackBoard skills, (4) Satisfaction with resources, (5) Social networking, (6) WebCentral skills, (7) Attitudes toward use, (8) DMT efficiency, and (9) Satisfaction with library resources. DMT was used constantly for personal use (64.6%), rather than educational (44.3%). The Attitudes Toward Use factor was highly correlated with Use for Learning (.642) and DMT efficiency (.584) factors. Both the Student (66.2%) and Faculty (66.7%) populations indicated they were mostly self-taught users of DMT. Chi square test examined individual use of faculty and student ownership/use of DMT and found that faculty owned more PC, Tablets, and e-Book Readers compared to students. However, Faculty had a lower mean (2.89) for Use for Learning compared to Students (3.16). The General Use factor was statistically significant indicating a slight difference between student generational cohorts, however, the lower mean (3.35) for Non-Millennials, versus the 1986-1989 (3.52) cohort difference was only .17, and was not considered meaningful. Overall, results demonstrated that the Millennial generation did not report any meaningful differences in their use of technology compared to other student generational cohorts at DU.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation explores Chinese communication practices. I focus on the performance of intercultural communication and how the &quot;New Face&quot; of China was performed to the world and in day-to-day intercultural communication encounters during the 2008 Olympics. I analyze the Olympic Volunteer Training Manual as performative text as well as interviewed Beijing Olympic volunteers about their encounters with international visitors. Specifically, I discuss why the Olympics were a crucial moment for China to unveil its &quot;New Face&quot; to the world, what the &quot;New Face&quot; of China entails, and the reasons why China is in need of a new image on the world stage. I argue that we need to use Chinese concepts and conceptualizations to understand the cultural context, political climate, and deeply complex historical foundations China has when we question Chinese communication practices and performances. I reconceptualize the concept of face with Performance theory to show how the presentation of &quot;New China&quot; and the &quot;New Face of China&quot; during the Olympics was a performance based on &quot;harmony&quot; and the Confucian values of ren (humanism) and li (ritual propriety). Furthermore, I concentrate on how the &quot;New Face&quot; of China and harmony were actually performed by Olympic volunteers on the ground in both public and hidden transcripts. While the Volunteer Training Manual works to performatively generate an image of New China, volunteers on the ground doing intercultural communication that they had learned during training sessions also generated an image of China on the ground, contrary to images in the U.S. imaginary, and in day to day encounters. Although China went to great efforts to present China as a harmonious society, on the ground we see that within harmony there is difference (in communication, performance, and practice) and negotiation through the struggles of everyday life Chinese deal with. More importantly, we find new possibilities and yearnings for peaceful coexistence.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the process of psychotherapy with adolescents in group psychotherapy, assessing the adolescents&apos; motivation to change behaviors, also called stage of change beliefs, and how these relate to the quality of the relationship, or working alliance, between the adolescent and therapist.  Adolescent ratings of group cohesiveness were also measured.  Twenty participants between the ages of 13 and 18 receiving group treatment in an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) at a psychiatric hospital in Colorado were included in the study.  The IOP group targeted parents and adolescents and implemented a manualized treatment to improve family communication and adolescent functioning.   The group met for five weeks with three sessions per week.  Assessment measures utilized included the Ohio Scales, the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form Revised (WAI-SR), and the Group Climate Questionnaire-Short (GCQ-S).  Participants completed the WAI-SR and GCQ-S four times to measure working alliance development and group cohesion.  The URICA was administered at the beginning and end of the IOP group to measure the participants&apos; stage of change beliefs.   Data were analyzed with profile analyses, independent sample t-tests, and Pearson product moment correlations.  Participants improved in overall functioning with decreased problem severity ratings during the group.  Working alliance and group cohesion were shown to be correlated during the second half of the IOP group.  Working alliance and stage of change beliefs were not correlated.  Working alliance ratings did not increase significantly over time.  Parent and adolescent ratings of the adolescents&apos; stage of change beliefs at the beginning and end of the IOP group were not correlated.  Adolescents with previous mental health treatment rated their stage of change as Precontemplation most often while those with no prior mental health treatment rated stage of change as Preparation or Action.  Overall, these findings suggest that brief group treatment may improve adolescent functioning and decrease their ratings of problem severity.  Also significant for adolescent group psychotherapy research is the relatedness of working alliance and group cohesion.  Further research is needed to learn how stages of change beliefs affect adolescents and how the working alliance develops in psychotherapy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation study examined the relationship between vicarious traumatization and job retention among 1,192 child welfare professionals in five different child welfare organizations.  Propositions from Constructivist Self Development Theory (CSDT) were utilized to examine the differential factors influencing the impact of vicarious trauma on child welfare professionals&apos; intent to leave their organization, including coping strategies, professional efficacy, and professional satisfaction.  Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to assess the degree of fit between the observed data and several hypothesized theoretical models examining the relationship between vicarious trauma, coping strategies, professional efficacy, professional satisfaction, and retention.  Findings from SEM analyses revealed a significant relationship between vicarious traumatization and intent to leave, as mediated by professional efficacy and professional satisfaction.  This finding indicated that child welfare professionals who experienced higher rates of vicarious traumatization were more likely to leave their organization.  Implications of these findings for theory, research, and social work practice are delineated.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Technology-based education is learning primarily based in constructivist styled pedagogies. It is neither good nor bad; its value is inherent to the user and environment where it is placed. While some churches place a high value on the benefits gleaned from its use, others abhor it in religious education.Why churches incorporate or reject technology-based education is a phenomenon that baffles most educators because the logic invoked is neither sound nor empirical. Either way, technology continues to evolve in education circles beyond the walls of the local church. In order to preserve the historical traditions and the distinctive cultures of their organizations, many churches have refrained from using information and communication technologies for educational purposes. Instead, technology is relegated to office functions and sermon preparation practices. However, through the provisioning of grants, restructuring of budgets, and the generosity of alumni, theological schools have implemented information and communication technologies to expand their reach into religious education markets. In religious education, a divide exists between leaders and laity regarding educational development. Education for clergy adheres to guidelines prescribed by their respective religious bodies; however, lay education is local, traditionally non-formal, synchronous, and unregulated.Traditionally, pastors consign ecclesiastical ministry to laity similar to the way parents relegate care giving to the eldest child. The primary considerations prior to prescribing responsibility are spiritual maturity, time served, and potential. Formal training and prior participation in the ministry are additional factors. In terms of educational development, clergy and laity differ in information and communication technologies use.This research seeks to understand and report the manner in which information and communication technologies (ICT) are used within a local church. This report is a review of the qualitative data on the education offered and the pedagogical practices of ICT used in teaching and development of laity.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>To Get the Shot or Not? Narratives, Rhetoric, and the Childhood Vaccination Controversy</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Parents in developed countries like the United States are questioning the need for and safety of childhood vaccinations. Incidences of disease have risen as fewer parents have vaccinated their children. Perhaps the most significant public figure to reinforce the choices of parents not-to-vaccinate is Jenny McCarthy, whose best-selling book details her theory about the cause of, and cure for, her son&apos;s autism. As I demonstrate, the study of the narratives is vital for understanding the vaccination crisis, not the least because of the extent to which McCarthy&apos;s (2007) story has echoed through parenting communities. I examine whether chosen anti- and pro-vaccination narratives meet the requirements of Fisher&apos;s (1984) narrative paradigm. In addition, I examine how the narratives might promote a sense of identification with audience members, particularly in how the narrators deal with a sense of guilt about the condition of their children (Burke, 1969). Further, I concentrate on both the functional nature of these narratives and on the constitutive components. The public is clearly divided on the vaccination issue. As I argue, this division may well come down to the way in which these distinct narratives constitute audiences differently, constitutions that both encourage people to act in particular ways through a sense of identification, and also outline the boundaries of what it means to be a &quot;good&quot; parent, such that one may be more swayed, consciously or unconsciously, by one type of narrative than another. Finally, I examine how the narratives deal with the conflict between personal choice and the public good. This dissertation also addresses the question of how to make Fisher&apos;s paradigm a powerful tool for the rhetorical analysis of narratives. As I argue, focusing more explicitly than has previously been done on the Burkean (1969a, 1969b) concept of identification and including Burke&apos;s guilt/purification/redemption cycle in the analysis of narratives, we begin to see why stories that &quot;should&quot; be rejected by readers for failing to achieve the requirements of the narrative paradigm become widely accepted instead. In addition, this dissertation contributes to the field of communication, particularly health communication.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Trends in Heavy-Duty Diesel Emissions and Analyses of Colorado&apos;s Light-Duty Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Emission trends are reported and discussed resulting from the multi-year study of Heavy-Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDV) at the Port of Los Angeles and at a weigh station in Peralta also in the L.A. basin.  Remote sensing data were also collected from the Port of Houston and compared to the data from California.  As part of San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP) to fast track the turnover rate of cleaner trucks, many truck operators have been subject to modifying their trucks, or have purchased new trucks, with more advanced control technologies to reduce exhaust particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  These advanced control technologies have been proven to effectively reduce these emissions but have some unwanted effects such as increasing the NO2/NO ratio in diesel exhaust which has the potential to increase ground level ozone. Ammonia (NH3) was found to be an unexpected product from one of the new control technologies as almost all the NOx is reduced to NH3.  In addition to the HDDV comparison, two years worth of emissions records from Colorado&apos;s light-duty fleet Inspection Maintenance (I/M) program were matched and compared with the on-road measurements.  This analysis shows that switching to an On-Board Diagnostics only program would cost 5-8 times as much as the currently used dynamometer tests and achieve only a fraction of emissions benefit from the current I/M program.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study developed a new instrument for measuring couples&apos; attitudes and behaviors regarding housework. This study was conducted in two phases. The first phase focused on developing reliable subscales that would reflect various dimensions of housework. Phase one consisted of 199 individual participants in committed relationships who were working at least 20 hours per week and shared a single home address with their partner. Participants answered questions related to housework through an online survey. An exploratory factors analysis (EFA) revealed eight dominant factors from the housework questionnaire, labeled as: 1) Fairness, 2) Value of Housework, 3) Gender Role Attitudes, 4) Hiring Outside Help, 5) Showing Appreciation, 6) Conflict over Housework, 7) Enjoyment of Housework, and 8) Personal Standards of Housework. The second phase examined the validity of the new measure by testing a set of hypotheses while also exploring gender differences related to various dimensions of housework. Phase two consisted of 103 couple participants in which both partners were working at least 20 hours per week and shared a single home address. Participants completed an online survey, which consisted of the newly developed housework measure, as well as other questionnaires aimed at assessing overall relationship quality. Several important themes emerged from the findings. First, females&apos; perceptions about housework are more informative about overall relationship quality than males&apos; perceptions. Second, perceived fairness matters more than housework equality in terms of predicting overall satisfaction with housework. Furthermore, for women, housework satisfaction matters more than fairness in predicting overall relationship satisfaction; for men, both fairness and satisfaction with the division of housework were important in predicting overall relationship quality. Third, relative resources predict housework allocations such that when the male earns more, the female does more of the housework and when the female earns more, the male does more of the housework; furthermore, partners with relatively equal earnings share the housework equally. Finally, traditional patterns are still very apparent, especially once couples have children. Implications and contributions of the present study are discussed, as well as areas for future research related to housework.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The intent of this research study was to determine the types of workplace pressures that PK-8 teachers, in a Midwestern Archdiocese, experience.  Two hundred eighty teachers participated in the survey. Results from this study indicate that PK-8 teachers express elevated levels of stress in the following areas:  income/salary, amount of hours spent outside contract hours on instructional tasks, paperwork required, student behavior/discipline, and implementation of new curricula.Statistical differences were found in the following areas: female and male stress levels with regard to income; school locale (suburban, urban, and rural) income stress levels; school locale (suburban, urban, and rural) implementation of new curricula stress levels; school locale (suburban, urban, and rural) paperwork stress levels.Reasons teachers report for wanting to leave their job include salary/benefits, dislike of administration, lack of administrative support, and excessive demands outside of contract hours.  Reasons for wanting to stay include that their job offers an increase in pay/salary, relationships with coworkers, and the students that they teach.Teachers and administrators must be aware of workplace pressures and make necessary adjustments.  If schools know how to manage and identify workplace pressures a better school climate can be achieved.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the late 20th century and early 21st century, contemplative education/studies courses, concentrations, and initiatives have emerged in the academy. Although there has been significant discussion of postsecondary courses and programs that have integrated contemplative views and practices in the literature, there have been few studies of contemplative curricula and pedagogy in higher education. Additionally, there have been even fewer inquiries of the influence of contemplative education on performing arts training within conservatories and college and university departments. The aim of this qualitative study was two-fold: (1) to describe, interpret, and appraise the impact of contemplative education on the curricula of an interdisciplinary conservatory level performing arts program, MFA Contemporary Performance, at Naropa University; and (2) to disclose, compare, and analyze MFA student perceptions of the influence of contemplative education on their professional and personal development. The following questions guided this study: (1) How do faculty and students characterize contemplative education within the MFA in Theater: Contemporary Performance Program? (2) How does contemplative education impact the intended and operational curricula of courses within the MFA Contemporary Performance Program? (3) How do graduate students perceive the effects of contemplative education, offered by the MFA Contemporary Performance Program, on the development of  their communication abilities, presence-in-performance, sociolinguistic perspectives, and aesthetic perspectives?Based on the research methodology of educational criticism and connoisseurship, this investigation provides a vivid description and interpretation of the intended and operational curricula of three core courses within the MFA program. These curricula were examined through five dimensions: intentional, curricular, pedagogical, structural, and evaluative. In order to shape our understanding of the contemplative and performative nature of the curricula, the significant and subtle qualities of the courses were further captured by preparation, context-building, reflective, showing, and closing conventions. Since the courses were grounded in postmodern view, they were evaluated according to Doll&apos;s criteria of richness, recursion, relations, and rigor for the evaluation of postmodern curricula.MFA first- and second-year students primarily characterized contemplative education as body/mind training for performance and personal development, sitting meditation, and cultivation of mindfulness and awareness. Student perceptions of the impact of contemplative education on the development of their communication abilities, presence-in-performance, sociolinguistic perspectives, and aesthetic perspectives, throughout the course of their two-year training, are presented in a dimensional analysis.The research reveals eight different themes that intersect the three core curricula and interviews with MFA students and faculty. These thematics include inclusivity, nowness, silence, improvisation, goodness, heart, training, and space. The beginning letter of each theme combines to form the acronym, insights. The framework of insights connects and illuminates the most potent aspects of MFA Contemporary Performance values and training.</dc:description>
