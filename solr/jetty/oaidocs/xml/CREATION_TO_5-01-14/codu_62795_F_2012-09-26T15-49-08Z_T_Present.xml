  <dc:description>This dissertation research examines the interplay between prehistoric population dynamics and paleoenvironment, and the extent to which these factors influenced culture change over the last 3000 years on the western High Plains of Colorado.  The population dynamics of prehistoric hunter-gatherers in eastern Colorado were estimated using several proxies, including the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon ages from archaeological sites in eastern Colorado.  Understanding paleoenvironments of the western High Plains is critical to understanding prehistoric human adaptations to past climates and to predicting the magnitude and consequences of current climate change in this semi-arid region.  Analyses of sediment cores from small fens (groundwater fed peatlands) on the High Plains indicate they contain high resolution (sub-decadal) paleoenvironmental records that extend into the middle Holocene (ca. 7800 BP).  These &quot;pocket fens&quot; are small peatlands (25-2500 m2) sustained by springs fed by perched water tables.  Fluctuations in the relative humification and organic content of peat from these features provide proxies for effective moisture and temperature, respectively.  Due to the heterogeneity of the sediments contained within pocket fens, new methods of data analysis and display have been developed to compensate for sediment differences within and between fens.  Data from pocket fens suggest that they contain sensitive records of relatively low magnitude climate fluctuations.Well-dated, high-resolution records of paleoenvironment are important because they allow a more detailed examination of the complex relationship between climate, population and culture change.  Here, these records from pocket fens not only document extended periods of high amplitude deviations in climate (such as drought) that could have influenced cultural adaptations, they also document periods of high temporal variability in proxy temperature and effective moisture that could have disrupted existing cultural systems.  Periods of high temporal variability in climate would result in lower predictability of environment-dependent resources on an annual and decadal temporal scale, which in turn might have exceeded the inherent resiliency of cultural adaptations available within the knowledge base of these systems.  Episodes of drought and high temporal variability in conjunction with periods of increasing population pressure correlate to periods of culture change during the past 3000 years in the archaeological record for eastern Colorado.  This suggests that increased population and climate variability drove prehistoric culture change.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>As an acknowledgment of the critical role of education in realizing other development targets, the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of the United Nations include education in a framework of development targets. The MDG targets for education include achieving universal primary education and gender parities in all levels of education by 2015.Recent global campaigns have added to the momentum of the rapid progress of educational expansion, which began in roughly the 1960s. Countries with universal or near universal participation and completion in elementary education have started to look beyond primary, towards free and compulsory basic education- education up to lower secondary- for all their citizens.This dissertation will explore the progress towards, and viability of, meeting current and potential global targets at various stages of basic education. It will answer questions such as: What path is the world on in terms of meeting the MDG goal of universal primary education? Which regions and countries are at risk of falling short of that target? How will lower-secondary education unfold in different regions of the world? Will there be any disparity between boys and girls as the countries expand their primary and lower-secondary education? What needs to be done to meet the current MDG for universal primary education and to move the global system towards universal lower secondary at the global, regional, and country level?To find the answers, we developed a long-term educational forecasting model that represents the student and financial flows through the different levels of a formal educational system from primary to tertiary. The model is integrated within the broader International Futures model and represents the economic and demographic forces shaping the supply and demand of education. The broader International Futures system models the impacts of education on societal variables like fertility, productivity, and income, thus creating a feedback loop.According to our analyses, most of the developing countries will continue their educational expansion at a speed faster than the speed that the developed countries showed when they were at a comparable stage of development. However, some of the developing regions will still be far away from universal participation or gender parity in primary and lower secondary, largely due to the low initial condition in these regions. 	Forecasts from the base case of our educational model show the pace of progress will not be sufficient to meet the education MDGs. Two of the world regions, sub-Saharan Africa and South and West Asia, might not be able to enroll all their children in elementary schools by 2015. These two and one other UNESCO region, the Arab States, do not see universal lower secondary education in the horizon even at 2020. In the base case, all UNESCO regions but two will reach or be close to gender parity in primary education by 2015. While the Arab States will be close to parity by 2030, the sub-Saharan African index will not reach parity until mid-century. Latin America and the Caribbean, on the other hand, might experience a reverse gender bias favored towards girls by 2015, but will re-approach parity later.Lowering population growth will lessen the demand pressure in these countries and thus help them achieve better rates of participation in basic education. A better economy will help them spend more on education and thus get better results.Exploration of the recent growth patterns in access to and progress in education convinced us that there is  room for some acceleration of the progress in these areas. We have combined these findings to develop an aggressive but realistic normative scenario, where growth targets in educational flow rates, rather than an absolute coverage, are pursued.Even with the improved results from the normative scenario, the world is unlikely to meet the 2015 MDG targets. However, the sub-Saharan African region, as a whole, would be sufficiently close to the target of universal primary education by 2020. All other regions meet the MDG of universal primary under the normative scenario, with South and West Asia just barely making it. Under the normative scenario, all but one world region, sub-Saharan Africa, reach 95 percent or higher gross participation rate in lower secondary by 2020. It is almost mid-century by the time sub-Saharan Africa reaches close to universal lower secondary.Substantial progress in terms of gender parity will occur under the normative scenario despite the goal being explicitly pursued under the normative scenario. As girls in developing regions catch up with boys these regions reach close to gender parity in primary education around 2015. By 2020, exact parity is obtained in all regions. While the reverse gender parity extant in regions like Latin America and the Caribbean will start to slide back starting in the 2020s, a similar reverse parity starts to show up in sub-Saharan Africa around that time.The transition to universal basic education is important for human development. It will take considerable time and efforts to complete the transition. While it is useful to coordinate the global efforts in making the transition, it is also important to take into account the differences across regions and nations in setting realistic targets and goalposts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project engages ideographic analysis to trace the rhetorical history of academic freedom. Specifically, this project seeks to uncover how the mainstream press defined and reported on academic freedom over the course of a 100-year period that represents the birth and maturation of American higher education. It is argued throughout this project that mainstream representations of and challenges to academic freedom shape public sympathy toward higher education, the professoriate, and the American student body.Through analysis of controversial professors in the early-1900s, the attempts to purge communists and fellow-travelers from higher education during the red scare, and conservative challenges to the left&apos;s so-called stranglehold on higher education during the latter half of the 20th century, this project uncovers both the political and social implications of control over the meaning of academic freedom and the reasons why such a simple concept can have such important ramifications for higher education, free speech, and democracy. As a result of this analysis, this document argues that academic freedom is a constantly evolving yet important political construct that groups and individuals with, often time, contradictory goals wrestle over in hopes of controlling the hearts and minds of America&apos;s college and university students.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A PASTORAL THEOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE IMAGE OF GOD: TOWARD A FRAMEWORK FOR PASTORAL CARE OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS AMONG KOREAN AMERICAN CHRISTIANS AND THEIR COMMUNITY</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In many Korean American ethnic churches, interpersonal conflicts cause suffering and often result in irrevocably broken relationships. Such suffering is exacerbated by pastoral responses that are individualistic and theologically inflexible. This dissertation asserts that interpersonal conflicts are symptomatic of a breakdown of relational systems - communal, societal, cultural and even ancestral - and theologically diagnoses broken relationships as a distorted actualization of the image of God.When the image of God is understood as a symbol rather than a static dogma orsign, it refers to a more relational and dynamic process of imaging God. This dissertation brings theological anthropology based on this interpretation of the image of God intodialogue with a traditional Korean anthropology of human between-ness and a self psychological understanding of human nature (using an object relations theory of personality) in order to construct a pastoral theology of the process of imaging God in theKorean American sociocultural context. Imaging God can be characterized as (1)fulfilling God&apos;s calling as human destiny by practicing the capacity for relationality communally and individually, (2) having relationships with God through genuine andauthentic interpersonal relationships, (3) being connected to ancestry as a way of reconnecting to one&apos;s familial and cultural roots and heritage, (4) building up genuine community through which persons enjoy a sense of security and belonging, (5)experiencing the relational space of human between-ness, and (6) respecting and celebrating the rich diversities in God&apos;s image-bearers and God&apos;s creatures. Pastoral care based on this understanding of the process of imaging God will foster healing and nurturing relationships. Pastoral caregivers can enhance the quality ofcommunal pastoral care by offering a relational atmosphere conducive to mutual sharing and empathy in their faith communities so that pastoral care can be mutually practicedamong the congregants. In a Korean American ecclesial context three major resources for practicing communal care are the class and band meetings, pastoral visitations, and the use of symbolism. These practices are used to illustrate ways in which the church canfind, create, and develop new resources of care that help communities engage in a processof imaging God.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>ABSTRACT The high school experience plays a major role in the shaping of a confident woman. Because adolescence is a particularly challenging time, often the presentation of the self is not authentic and can be displayed differently depending on the context associated with a given role.  The loss of voice is particularly problematic for female adolescents. Prior to becoming adolescents, girls are able to express themselves with confidence. With the onset of adolescence, it is common for girls to suppress their feelings, cover up what they knew as young children, diminish themselves and suppress their voice. Margaret Mead, in describing what she observed across cultures said that so many gifts are unused and unappreciated for women in western culture. She observed that women&apos;s voices are stilled.This research, examines the support for girls&apos; voices in a high school setting in order to answer five questions: 1. In the school setting, in which area of an adolescent girl&apos;s life is she most likely to feel free to express her true opinions?2. In the school setting, is an adolescent girl&apos;s voice more likely to be stifled in some content areas and subject matter rather than in others? 3. In the school setting, what is the link between teacher&apos;s pedagogy and adolescent girls&apos; voices? 4. In the school setting, what is the link between teacher&apos;s behavior and students&apos; perceptions? 5. In the school setting, what interventions can be utilized by teachers to encourage adolescent girls to confidently express their opinions?This qualitative study employed the method of educational criticism. I viewed the lives of four students for three days each, attending all of their classes and extracurricular activities.  I also interviewed these students prior to the shadowing process and informally during the shadowing process.The study resulted in several important findings. First, the structural dimension of the school is critical to support for voice and student success.  Several aspects of the school&apos;s structure impact students expression of voice including: a healthy culture, strong leadership, an authentic social climate, respect for individuals, an organized, and safe physical environment, effective communication and an organized transition to life after high school. The second emergent theme is that pedagogy plays a major role in the shaping of confident young women. When pedagogy matters there is a strong emphasis on learning, teachers act as guides in the learning process, there is an emphasis on a high standard of excellence, teachers support voice with a safe, yet urgent classroom environment, thus developing confidence and competence in learning. A strong curriculum is the third theme, which includes diverse academic and extra-curricular offerings.  The three themes identified above were integrated into a Radar Chart of the School&apos;s Culture. The fourth theme emphasizes the girls&apos; intentions, i.e. what they expect from their schooling experience.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>An Ethnographic and Philosophical Investigation into Patrol Officers: Communication Ethics as Critical Work</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This ethnographic study explores the communication ethics of patrol officers in a large, metropolitan city. The researcher spent over 300 hours riding in a patrol car. The study is inductive, analyzing eighteen case studies on philosophical, interpretive, and critical levels. PART I: CROSSING OVER follows the researcher&apos;s introduction to the world of the police, including their hermeneutic of war and the &quot;Rider&apos;s Curse.&quot; It describes how observations were conducted and analyzes the gendered and linguistic performance of the researcher as ways to gain and maintain access.PART II: ETHICS introduces four &quot;ethical realities&quot; through a welfare check on a mother and her children. These four realities include yelling/verbal force, non-response/tangential response, monologue, and acknowledgment. They are based on the touchstones of safety, authoring/authority, control, and the need for human contact, respectively. These realities are explained and analyzed with philosophical perspectives on what ethics are, notably phenomenological and Levinasian views.PART III: CONTEXT expands this understanding of the interactions to consider how different relationships and voices (Bakhtin&apos;s concept of &quot;polyphony,&quot; 1984) construct and constitute interactions. Lateral relationships are analyzed through a &quot;narrative ethics&quot; (Newton, 1995) of how officers tell stories to each other. Line (top-down) relationships reveal the phenomenological presence of the law and supervisors. The stress and danger of patrol officer interactions are explored. The idea of the &quot;holistic moment&quot; is proposed as a way to describe the multi-layered nature and ethical complexity of an interaction.PART IV: CRITICAL takes a critical turn. Following Althusser&apos;s (1991) &quot;interpellation&quot; of subjects, the study interrogates the researcher, the officers, and society. The researcher&apos;s behavior demonstrates the pervasiveness of the ideology of the police world in regards to race, gender, sexuality, and power and &quot;normalizes&quot; unethical forms of communication. The officers&apos; use of &quot;war&quot; as the dominant way to communicate is interrogated, especially during &quot;social work&quot;-type interactions. Society is interrogated for its complicity in reproducing the &quot;war&quot;-type interactions officers are constructed into. The study concludes by positioning communication ethics as critical work and offers Levinas as a way to simultaneously critique, empower, and emancipate concrete subjects.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study assessed how leadership, teachers, and students at the building level utilized and experienced the processes of a school-reform model, STARplus, during the first year of implementation. The research also examined the effect of the STARplus processes on student academic performance in reading, mathematics and behavior as measured by district and state assessments, suspension referral data, classroom observation, and student perception.The study was a case study using mixed methodology. A concurrent nested model (Creswell, 2003) was the overarching research design. According to Creswell, this type of model offers the researcher an opportunity to collect both qualitative and quantitative data at the same time while giving emphasis to one type of data.In this study, the qualitative method was dominant, with information specific to perceptions and utilization of practices identified within the STARplus model collected during observations, surveys, and interviews of leadership and teachers in the school setting. The quantitative data was nested or embedded within the qualitative data. The information gathered was specific to gaining an understanding of how school leadership and teachers utilized STARplus through three levels: (a) teacher and leadership experiences during STARplus review sessions; (b) teacher and leadership perceptions of practices; and (c) student perception and performance.Results indicated that school leadership and teacher responses to the practices of STARplus were positive overall. Results of the study were examined by all implementing classrooms (N = 8) along with high (n = 3) and low (n = 5) implementing classrooms. Evidenced through the review meetings, surveys, and focus groups were (1) a focus on student learning; (2) ongoing attention to student behavior; (3) feedback and reflection emerging as crucial to success; and (4) collaborative practices resulting in capacity building. Results of the study suggested that student academic performance in reading and mathematics was significantly higher in all participating classrooms according to results of district assessments. While state assessments in reading and mathematics indicated overall growth when examining student scale scores of matched students, results were not significantly higher. Student suspension referrals did not decrease, but were significantly fewer in the classrooms of high-implementation teachers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study represents the first attempt to assess the transformational leadership behaviors of female sport coaches and how those behaviors relate to performance and cohesion.  Fifty-one Division I female head soccer coaches at institutions sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association were contacted.  The response rate for the study was 68%, with 15 of the coaches not responding to phone messages about participation in the study.  A total of 30 female head soccer coaches and 451 female soccer student-athletes completed surveys.  Coaches completed a demographic information form and a measure that assessed transformational leadership behaviors.  Student-athletes completed a demographic information form, and three measures that assessed transformational leadership, cohesion, and satisfaction with performance.  Results revealed that transformational leadership positively predicted team cohesion and satisfaction with performance and that cohesion significantly meditated the relationship between transformational leadership and satisfaction with performance.  Also suggested from the results is that as the discrepancy between student-athlete ratings of coach leadership and coach self-ratings of leadership decreased, performance increased.  Lastly, findings from this study show that task cohesion has a stronger relationship with satisfaction with performance than social cohesion.  The results of this study suggest that transformational leadership is likely to help sport coaches to lead in an effective, satisfying way while increasing levels of cohesion and performance within their teams.   The practical implications of these findings are addressed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Carolyn L. Woempner Title: ANALYSIS OF STAKEHOLDER PERCEPTIONS OF EDUCATION REFORM IN COLORADO Advisor: Dr. Ellen Bennett Steiner Degree Date: March 2008  ABSTRACT  The development of successful public policy is dependent on an understanding of public perceptions of existing or anticipated public problems and of acceptable solutions to those problems. This study used the Policy Delphi method to solicit and analyze the perceptions of geographically and demographically diverse stakeholders across the state about education reform in Colorado, focusing on Goals of education, Strategies to achieve goals, and Barriers that stand in the way. Results indicated that stakeholders in Colorado perceive a lack of support for education at the legislative, social, professional, and financial levels. Additionally, respondents were clear that post-high school preparation must emphasize both work-readiness and college-readiness and students must be treated as individuals within the education system. The development of critical thinking and problem solving skills was seen as essential in instructional reform, which may be hindered by the current emphasis on standardized testing. These findings indicate that the development of public policy in education should first focus on building foundational support before specific functional or structural reforms, and illustrate the priorities held by the public in terms of public policy and education reform, i.e. post-secondary preparation in many forms, individual rather than uniform instruction and program design for students, and development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. These findings are useful to clarify policy issues and inform the development of effective and palatable public policy around education reform in Colorado.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This work investigated sorption of nitrogen heterocycles with applications relevant to environmental sampling and explosives detection.  Despite having a high water solubility (21 g/L), caffeine adsorption on some clay minerals and sediments was found to be significant.  This was an important observation pertaining to caffeine&apos;s use as an anthropogenic marker.  Caffeine adsorption was measured on natural sediments and a series of homoionic montmorillonites.  Kd values were determined on each of the sorbents in the pH range of 6.7 to 8.7.  The Kd values ranged from &lt; 0.7 to 150 (+/- 8) L/kg for the natural sediments and 290 (+/- 6) to 4.0 x 105 (+/- 1.5 x 105) L/kg for the homoionic montmorillonites.  Infrared methods and molecular modeling were used to demonstrate three different adsorption mechanisms for caffeine binding to the montmorillonites.  The adsorption mechanism and Kd values were highly dependent on the exchangeable cation at the mineral surface.To obtain quality FTIR spectra for the caffeine study, a novel method for the analysis of clay minerals using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was developed.  Clay mineral suspensions were dried on a Si wafer substrate for transmission IR analysis.  Four natural source clays, SWy2, SAz1, SHCa1 and KGa1b, as well as the synthetic hectorite, Laponite RD, were analyzed using the described method.  Signal to noise (s/n) ratios in excess of 100,000 for the strongly absorbing Si-O stretching frequency were obtained.  IR spectra were generated and peak locations were compared to previously reported values generated from KBr pellet and ATR methods.Gas chromatography was used to determine the enthalpy of solution, ΔHSol, for a series of nitroaromatic explosives and explosive degradation products.  Five stationary phases of various polarities, ranging from dimethylsiloxane to polyethylene glycol, were evaluated with 13 nitroaromatic compounds.  Isothermal Kováts retention indices are also reported for the nitroaromatics as well as the ΔHSol of several n-alkanes.  A model encompassing the 13 nitroaromatics on 5 stationary phases is presented that predicts ΔHSol for nitroaromatics in polymeric materials when McReynolds constants are available for the polymer.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the influence of youth-centered church-based programs on the everyday lives of African American urban youth in two African American Colorado churches. The study revealed that the youth who participate in youth-centered church-based programs are influenced positively by them when strong leadership, relevant curriculum, and meaningful relationships are present.This study has been framed by a review of the literature that reveals that youth who are involved in church activities are less likely to become involved in deviant behavior. Furthermore, they have the capacity to overcome stressful situations and to bounce back in the aftermath of adversity. The literature also suggests that churches, parents, and schools who serve African American children can positively influence their behaviors through mentoring, family support, and strong leadership that encourage leadership and spiritual development.Research on this topic is limited, but is gradually increasing. Most research regarding the influence of church-based youth programs on African American children has surfaced in the last 15 years, with the majority being in the last 5-10 years. This increased interest may be attributed to the increased level of suicides, teenage pregnancies, drugs, violence, and other forms of &quot;at risk&quot; behaviors that exist within the African American youth population.This study contributes to the growing body of literature by describing the influence of effective church-based youth programs on today&apos;s urban African American youth. Specifically, the findings provide best practices that have positively influenced the everyday lives of urban African American youth.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In recent years the relationship between Caribbean states and China has intensified. This dissertation argues that the Caribbean&apos;s increased engagement with China is an important component of their economic adjustment strategy that was necessitated after changes in the orientation of the international economic system that they must operate within, particularly in relation to the loss of trade preferences and the sharp decline in official development assistance.Despite the seemingly homogenous nature of these Caribbean states there is in fact significant foreign policy variation seen vis-à-vis engagement with China. Some Caribbean states have consistently recognized China, while others have vacillated between recognition of China and Taiwan. The source of this variation lies in differences in endowment of resources that are of strategic importance to China. The more resource-endowed countries demonstrate more foreign policy consistency while the resource-poor countries have exhibited a less consistent foreign policy towards China.The dissertation also explores the extent to which the relationship with China is beneficial for these states. It will be shown that despite the lack of explicit conditionalities accompanying Chinese aid and loans, there are important implicit conditionalities such as the awarding of contracts to Chinese firms and the importation of Chinese laborers that thwart the potential benefits accruing to Caribbean states from this relationship with China.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to describe and interpret the perspectives of parents who were made aware that their child was struggling academically or behaviorally and was being referred to a problem-solving team in a neighborhood public school.  Using a multiple case study design, five parents were observed in an initial school problem-solving meeting and interviewed before and after the meeting to better understand the parents&apos; roles in and perspectives of the process.  The meeting was audiotaped, transcribed, and coded to provide information about the team process and team member roles.Results indicated parents were very satisfied with the meeting itself despite having some confusion about the process and the outcome.  Parents had few expectations upon entering the meeting and were unsure of what roles they would play in the meeting.  Despite their initial apprehension, parents talked openly in the meetings and were active members.  An analysis of the team found that the team had an effective facilitator and members who were very positive, responsive, and friendly to parents and created an atmosphere in which parents felt respected.  Team members also treated parents as experts on their child and actively solicited their input in the meeting.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Although gay athletes are definitely a part of the current composition of Division I athletics teams, few studies address this particular population.  Further no study has reported the factors that support visibility/invisibility for this population of students.  This qualitative phenomenological study explored the question: What factors contribute to the visibility/invisibility of Division I gay male collegiate athletes? The purpose of this study was to disclose those internal and external factors that may contribute to whether a gay athlete passes as heterosexual or conceals his identity?  Further, this study also sought to understand the outcomes of visibility and the ways higher educational institutions can make gay athletes feel more included.I conducted a series of three interviews with each of the eight participants.  I focused on their life histories surrounding sport and self-identification as gay, their current experience being visible/invisible to their team and coaches, and their reflection on the meaning of being both gay and an athlete within Division I athletics.  Using the most compelling quotes from interviews I then constructed unique profiles reflecting their background.I used Colaizzi&apos;s (1978) approach for analyzing data.  The analysis included the extraction of significant meanings related to the phenomena, clustering the data into themes, an exhaustive description of the phenomenon, and finally an unequivocal statement expressing the essence of the phenomenon.  Data was collapsed into four themes: internal factors of invisibility/visibility, external factors of invisibility/visibility, the gay athlete acceptance continuum, and the costs and benefits of invisibility/visibility.  Factors reflect an updated model of Clair, Beatty, and Maclean&apos;s (2005) conceptual model of the decision to pass or reveal one&apos;s identity.Most importantly this research makes suggestions for the higher educational community, including faculty, staff, coaches, athletics administration and the NCAA on ways to make the experience of Division I gay athletes more positive.  This research confirms the ways in which athletics culture silences gay male identity particularly for those athletes from high profile team sports.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Characterization of the Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Hypercorticism in Spawning Pacific Salmon</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Pacific salmon are semelparous fish that undergo accelerated senescence and death after a single reproductive event.  Sustained hypercorticism has been implicated in the systematic physiological degeneration of post-spawning Pacific salmon.  However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for cortisol overproduction in spawning Pacific salmon have yet to be fully elucidated. The hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis is the neuroendocrine network responsible for modulating a broad range of physiological functions from reproductive activity to chronic stress response. Fluctuations in the production and/or regulation of cortisol by this axis can have serious consequences with respect to the survival of an organism.  In particular, sustained increases in plasma cortisol levels are directly correlated with metabolic disorders characterized by muscle atrophy, immune deficiency, adrenal hyperplasia, kidney dysfunction and systemic tissue degeneration.During the spawning migration, semelparous Pacific salmon undergo extensive tissue and organ degeneration. While it had previously been thought that the stress of marine to freshwater migration was responsible for the post-spawning demise of these fish, numerous studies have implicated the sustained overproduction of cortisol during sexual maturation and spawning as the event which ultimately leads to the demise of spawning Pacific salmon. Conversely, salmonids such as iteroparous steelhead trout also experience sharply elevated cortisol levels during spawning.  In these animals, however, cortisol levels return to normal after spawning, suggesting hypersecretion of cortisol in spawning salmonids in not necessarily irreversible.The current study uses a combination of molecular and proteomic strategies to compare the differences in hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal activity and its potential impact on cortisol release in semelparous salmon and iteroparous steelhead rainbow trout.  This comparative approach provides further insight into the physiological differences between these two distinct reproductive strategies and underlying molecular mechanisms regulating hypercorticism in spawning Pacific salmon.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines what might be going on in and around schools that helps some students to overcome the stigma and suffering of being bullied, and what might be going on that gets in their way.  What do schools do to increase the likelihood of these students&apos; surviving bullying intact and thriving thereafter?  What do schools do to diminish that likelihood?To answer this question, a retrospective, qualitative study was performed with two populations, using an extreme sampling approach: a group of high achieving, suburban high school students enrolled in advanced placement courses, and a group of incarcerated young men.  Each group was given a retrospective survey to determine if they had been bullied when they were in grade school, and those from each group with the highest cumulative scores on the survey were selected to be interviewed.From the interviews, the following findings emerged.  What schools did that most helped to bullied children survive their bullying was (a) engage them in challenging work, and (b) support them through caring adults.  What happened in schools that most hurt bullied children or got in the way of coping with their bullying was (a) changes in school structure (accompanying the shift from elementary to middle school), (b) adult non-intervention in bullying when it happened, and (c) isolation of victimized children from their school community.  Three fundamental needs of bullied students, which could potentially be fulfilled by the school, also emerged from analysis of the interviews: (a) the need for a place of refuge and safety, (b) the need for caring adults, and (c) the need for a sense of a positive future awaiting them if they only stay in school.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Locality intersects with international security through the lens of one of the larger manpower drivers of recent African wars ---child soldiers. This study compares the border regions of the Namibian Kavango with the Mano River and Kailahun regions of Sierra Leone, as war and children crossed over from Angola and Liberia, respectively.  Local norms and networks in child soldiering illuminate two aspects of international security ---the problem of war contagion and the challenges of international regime efficacy.First, is the relationship between local capabilities and the expansion of war. The fieldwork shows war&apos;s spread and child soldiering are intertwined, through local vulnerabilities, and local capabilities. It dissects local configurations and shows that border localities are not endemically dangerous. Though the role of locality can serve as a stimulus and momentum for expanding war, expected and unexpected pathways of local action can make a difference in both in the degree of war&apos;s spread and the extent of children&apos;s participation.Second, what could be called a global anti-child soldiering regime, an international configuration strongly linked to the protection-based theoretic in human security, emerged and flourished over the past 15 years. Programmatic actions against child soldiering, accompanied by international legal norms shunning child soldiering, have escalated dramatically. Yet, international estimates of child soldiers active in combat did not diminish. On the contrary, child soldiering grew from 250,000 children a year in 1998, to more than 300,000 in 2005. Why haven&apos;t these actions halted child soldiering growth?In detailing local involvement and resistance to cross-border child soldiering, distinct gaps between the conceptual and substantive factors of import in prevention locally, and those stressed by anti-child soldier networks globally, come to light. The findings in provide needed political specificity for the human security literature and the global anti-child soldiering regime. The concrete conditions and localized ideas where efforts to thwart child soldiering have had some success (Namibia) and where they have not (Sierra Leone) demonstrate capabilities that aid children and civilians in conflict zones. Flowing from the study&apos;s finding, are a risk continuum and analytic tools for targeting support for local capabilities, local capabilities that push away from regional violent involvement on the whole, and from children&apos;s involvement specifically.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Across the nation, an achievement gap exists between high poverty and minority students and their higher SES, white peers. While research indicates that the gap can be decreased and even eliminated with highly effective teachers, very few studies provide the field of education with a set of discrete actions that teachers must do in order to successfully close the achievement gap. As America&apos;s population of children becomes increasingly diverse, teachers need to know how to be highly effective in reaching diverse populations.This study used a mixed methodological approach to create a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon of elementary teachers closing the achievement gap with high poverty and minority students. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered, analyzed, and synthesized to develop a substantive theory. Through this process, the Reciprocal Learning Theory was developed. This theory explains the actions and behaviors of highly effective elementary teachers with high poverty and minority students.This study contributed to the field by providing an explanation, grounded in quantitative and qualitative data, on what highly effective teachers do to close the achievement gap with high poverty and monitory students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The overarching purpose of this research was to provide theoretical and conceptual foundations for developing a competency-based curriculum for an interdisciplinary master&apos;s program in Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Specifically, the objective was to ascertain the competencies and courses that are relevant for developing a competency model for a service scientist and a curriculum blueprint for SSME. The study employed three rounds of the online Delphi survey to achieve the research objectives. The three rounds were used to identify, prioritize, and define competencies and courses. A panel of industry professionals and university faculty were invited to participate as experts. A total of 51, 40, and 39 respondents participated in Round 1, Round 2 and Round 3 survey respectively.Overall, a high degree of consensus was observed among the participants for the importance of competencies and courses, however, there were some differences noted by the disciplinary expertise and professional background of the respondents. Based on the consensus of the study participants, a final list of 10 competencies and 14 courses was generated. These competencies were used to develop a competency model and the courses were used to create a curriculum blueprint.The final 14 courses were categorized into four modules, Module 1: Contextual Foundation (Information &amp; Service Economy, Consumer Behavior, Leadership &amp; Organizational Behavior, Project Management); Module 2: Service Core (Service Innovation, Service Design, Service Operations and Supply Chain); Module 3(a): Engineering Concentration (Business Process Modeling, Service Engineering, Quality Management); Module 3(b): Management Concentration, Strategic Management, Service Marketing, Enterprise Systems) and; Module 4: Integrative Capstone (Business and Technology Integration).The final 10 competencies were categorized into three clusters; Cluster 1: Service Mindset (Needs assessment, Conceptualize service system, Problem-solving, Contextualize service science); Cluster 2: Integrative Competence (Business and technology integration, Interdisciplinary collaboration, Diversity orientation) and; Cluster 3: Meta-competence (Adaptability, Interpersonal communication, and Critical thinking).The results of this study may serve as a common language among stakeholders to prepare future service scientists or &quot;T-shaped&quot; professionals for the service economy. This study also contributed to the body of literature of competency-based curriculum development in higher education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>People with reading disability (RD) exhibit deficits in comprehension monitoring, or the ability to assess understanding during reading. One reason monitoring problems may arise is because individuals with RD struggle so much with word identification that there are insufficient resources left for comprehension processes like monitoring. A second possibility is that individuals with RD may have a primary deficit in monitoring that is independent of their word identification difficulties.We performed two experiments to address whether comprehension monitoring constitutes a primary or secondary deficit in RD. Monitoring was evaluated using garden path sentences, each containing an ambiguous homograph, such as bow, that was incorrectly primed. Homograph corrections were the dependent variable assessing monitoring. In the first experiment, we evaluated whether monitoring difficulties can result from a typical reader spreading limited cognitive resources in a dual task paradigm where readers not only had to read and understand, but also had to keep track of the background color of the text. We also varied the decoding difficulty of the text to compare monitoring on texts that were virtually identical in meaning but varied in ease of decoding. Both manipulations resulted in decreased monitoring performance for typical readers, suggesting that indeed resource limitations may lead to difficulties in comprehension monitoring.In the second experiment we evaluated specifically whether decoding problems in RD affect monitoring performance. Again, we manipulated the decoding difficulty of the text. Individuals with RD monitored significantly more on simple than difficult texts. When decoding was covaried, we found no significant difference in monitoring between individuals with RD and age-matched controls. This suggests that when decoding problems are removed, individuals with RD are able to monitor their understanding as well as typical readers.In sum, the combined results of these two experiments offer strong support for resource limitations as an explanation for comprehension monitoring problems, suggesting that monitoring problems in RD are a secondary deficit that results from their decoding problems.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Currently, Latina/os have one of the highest rates of attrition in higher education (León, 2003; National Center for Educational Statistics, 2005b; US Census Bureau, 2000). In 2001, the percentage of first-time post-secondary Latina/o undergraduate completion rates (for students starting in 1995) were 5.5 % for students beginning their college education at two-year institutions and 11.4% for those beginning at four-year institutions (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2005b) as compared to white students with 11.4% and 61.9% respectively (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2005b).  Numerous studies have sought to understand the reasons for the high rates of Latina/o student attrition; however little research has been conducted on the impact of pedagogical techniques on Latina/o undergraduate student persistence. This research answered the question how do faculty members create inclusive pedagogies for undergraduate Latina/o students at a predominantly white, private institution.This research utilized Critical Race Theory (CRT), Alejandra Elenes&apos; (2006) theory of Border/Transformative Pedagogies, and inclusive pedagogy models as its guiding theoretical frameworks. More specifically, CRT guided all of the data collection and analysis procedures; whereas, Elenes&apos; (2006) research and the inclusive pedagogy models provided the foundation for the emanation of story telling. Using the qualitative methods of focus groups, interviews, document reviews, questionnaires, correspondence, and journaling, this research engaged Latina/o undergraduate students and recent graduates and faculty members in a dialogue about inclusive pedagogical techniques at a private predominantly white institution in western United States.The findings of this research fell into three categories: values, knowledge, and actions. The faculty and student participants stated that inclusive faculty members demonstrate the values of care, respect, life-long learning, and authenticity.  Inclusive faculty also exhibited basic knowledge of Latina/o cultures, the power of socio-economic status and race at predominantly white affluent institutions, and conflict management skills. Behaviorally, inclusive faculty members utilized a variety of techniques that a) included Latina/o cultures in assignments and classroom activities, b) encouraged Latina/o students to academically and socially engage in classroom learning, c) respected the multiple responsibilities of Latina/o students, d) created equitable learning environments, and e) engaged students outside of the classroom.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation uses a Foucaultian genealogy to examine the intersection of the U.S.&apos;s federal campaign to eliminate human trafficking with American Protestant Christianity.  I argue that the understanding of human trafficking and the imagination of freedom codified in &lt;em&gt;The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000&lt;em&gt; (TVPA) and enacted in federal anti-trafficking initiatives are constituted through this set of religious sensibilities.  Not only do these religious sensibilities shape the U.S.&apos;s anti-trafficking laws, under the presidential administration of George W. Bush they have become a prominent part of the U.S.&apos;s anti-trafficking project.In its legislative moment, or the processes through which the TVPA was created, I show that while the TVPA is not a piece of &quot;religious&quot; legislation, it is situated within a discourse of religious freedom rooted in Protestant Christianity.  Hence Protestant conceptions of what freedom entails condition the legislation&apos;s vision of  freedom from trafficking.  In its executive moment, or how the anti-trafficking legislation has been enacted, I show how the Bush administration has installed as the lynchpin of the U.S.&apos;s anti-trafficking stance a set of  religious claims that are particular to American Protestantism.  In both moments, conceptions of gender and sexuality crucially construct the emergent conception of freedom from trafficking.  Insofar as the U.S.&apos;s anti-trafficking stance employs sensibilities rooted in American Protestantism, the freedom that this project endorses corresponds to conventionally Protestant norms of sex and gender.  Especially as applied to women, the U.S.&apos;s anti-trafficking project functions as a Protestant disciplining of &quot;appropriate&quot; gender and sexuality.The Protestant norms that undergird the U.S.&apos;s foreign policies on human trafficking are not constitutive of freedom in any universal sense, yet these norms are imposed all around the world.  Because in a democratic, pluralistic society the state must not be permitted to compel ascription to any particular religious perspective, I conclude that the religious overtones and undertones of the U.S.&apos;s anti-trafficking stance are problematic.  The elimination of trafficking requires an approach that does not rely on sexual regulation as the primary ethical imperative of opposition to trafficking but, instead, one that protects and promotes practices of freedom.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Researchers and practitioners in the field of traumatology have emphasized the importance of a supportive work environment in helping trauma therapists cope with the demands of their work. The therapist&apos;s professional peer group can provide different types of support that may prevent or reduce the impact of compassion fatigue and burnout. Despite these discussions, there are no studies to date that have examined this relationship using well-defined and psychometrically sound measures of professional social support. The purpose of this study was to construct and provide validation for a measure of professional social support for mental health professionals who work with trauma clients. The measure was entitled The Professional Support Inventory for Mental Health Professionals (PSIMHP).The process of instrument development occurred in four phases. The literature review provided a conceptualization of professional social support for mental health professionals, which was used to create an item pool. A panel of experts evaluated the item pool, rating the items for relevancy, specificity, clarity, and usefulness. Quantitative evaluation was conducted in two phases, the pilot and the field study. A sample of 47 mental health professionals was included in the pilot study. Reliability was assessed using SPSS, which resulted in the deletion of one item from the pilot test. The measure was then re-administered to a second sample of 173 mental health professionals in the field study. Psychometric properties and evidence for the instrument&apos;s validity were examined using both classical test theory and Rasch Model analyses.Psychometric properties of the final revised version of the instrument (PSIMHP-R) revealed that the items demonstrated good fit, invariance across subgroups of mental health professionals, and offered greater support for a unidimensional measure. In addition, the distribution of person agreeability and item difficulty estimates obtained for the revised measure showed good coverage along the continuum, and items showed better differentiation among individuals with varying levels of professional support. Cronbach&apos;s alpha for the original and revised version of the measure were .95 and .92, respectively. The findings from this study also provided preliminary evidence for different types of validity. Study implications, limitations, and future directions were also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study focused on the variations of family patterns and the overall environment of family communication regarding a lost family member as reflected in the communication of the family system.  Participants were recruited in undergraduate communication courses at a Midwestern university, as well as via snowballing techniques in the same Midwestern city.  A total of 74 surveys were submitted that fulfilled the participation criteria of having lost an immediate family member at least two years ago.  Surveys were largely qualitative in nature and were available online at the Survey Monkey website.  Surveys were processed using thematic analysis and two separate, independent reviewers.The current study found a variety of ways that families pattern their communication in the process of re-establishing identity after a family member dies.  Two major distinctions stood out: the different patterns of interaction for within-family conversations versus those for conversations with people outside the family, and the patterns of interaction for families who did versus did not engage in interaction regarding their lost family member.  The study also found that emotional qualities related strongly to within-family interaction regarding lost family members, while taking the perspective of the &quot;other&quot; related strongly to non-family interaction regarding lost family members.    Finally, an initial Theory of Family Interaction Regarding Lost Family Members was proposed and discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explores the communicative dynamic that occurs between Denver police officers, and citizens of the African-American community, during traffic stops characterized as &quot;Driving While Black.&quot; Thirty four interviews were conducted regarding this study. Derived from the interviews were transcribed narratives, which were examined through the use of narrative analysis and various theoretical frameworks. The narrative analysis and theoretical frameworks provided a new lens for exploring the police/citizen communicative dynamic, and a foundation for additional communication research between police officers and the African-American community.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Victim blame can have detrimental effects on victims&apos; coping with traumatic events. The current study examined contextual (i.e., victim-observer ingroup membership and safety of the environment) and individual difference (i.e., world beliefs, trauma exposure, and cognitive semantic associations) factors in relation to victim blame. Ingroup membership predicted greater character praise in females, while outgroup membership predicted greater praise in males. Victim praise was also greater when the environment was safe versus dangerous. Stronger beliefs about the manageability of the world marginally predicted greater victim blame, while stronger benevolent world beliefs predicted less victim blame and less character derogation. Further, the number of traumatic event types reported by participants was positively related to character praise and negatively related to derogation. Histories of exposure to traumas high in betrayal predicted greater character derogation. Using an implicit semantic priming task to examine the automatic semantic associations between victim and derogation concepts, victim-to-derogation priming was related to less victim blame.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author:  Heidi V. PaceTitle:  EFFECTS OF DEVELOPING MATHEMATICAL IDEAS ON TEACHER PRACTICE IN THE ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS CLASSROOMAdvisor:  Dr. Ellen SteinerDegree Date:  August 2008ABSTRACTInternational measures of student achievement in mathematics over the past decade indicate that United States&apos; students do not perform as well as their counterparts in other countries.  Reform initiatives to address this deficit have included new curriculum, revised mathematics standards, alterations in school structures, and implementing new teaching strategies with minimal results.  The missing component in these initiatives has been a focus on the classroom teacher&apos;s own knowledge of and facility with mathematics and the impact this has on developing students&apos; understanding of math.This study explored whether elementary teachers who participated in the professional development program Developing Mathematical Ideas (DMI) implemented research-based mathematics practices more frequently than teachers who did not receive the training.  The study also reviewed student achievement in classes taught by DMI-trained teachers and those teachers not trained in DMI.  Instruments included a survey, interviews with 5 teachers and the state achievement results of third, fourth, and fifth grade students.The survey results showed no differences in the frequency of implementation of research-based practices for DMI and non-DMI-trained teachers with one exception.  DMI-trained teachers reported modifying the math curriculum and evaluating students&apos; learning gaps at a higher frequency than non-DMI-trained teachers.  The interviews pointed to a possible relationship between coaching following DMI training and higher teacher confidence levels in teaching math.  More coaching sessions may also improve teachers&apos; facility with mathematics.  Achievement results showed no mean difference in scale scores between third and fourth grade students taught by DMI-trained or non-DMI-trained teachers.  Fifth grade students taught by non-DMI-trained teachers had significantly higher mean scale scores than those taught by DMI-trained teachers.The findings from this study point to DMI not having a robust impact on teacher practice and having no positive impact on student achievement.  Survey design, sample size, program implementation, and other school district initiatives may explain some of these findings.  These findings may be limited to this study and may not generalize to another setting.  The implication that follow-up coaching may enhance the results of DMI training should receive further attention.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Colorado assesses approximately 98% of students enrolled in grades 3&amp;ndash10 in the area of mathematics. In 2005, 69,872 English Language Learners (ELLs) in grades 3&amp;ndash10 participated in the state content area assessments. In 2007, 88,060 ELLs participated in the state content area assessments. With this dramatic growth in the ELL population in the state of Colorado and elsewhere in the nation, ensuring that ELLs have access to comprehensible materials on state assessments is of paramount importance. Accommodations provide access for students based on their individual needs. Likewise, assessment items designed and or revised using the principles of plain language and universal design increase access to the content area information in assessments. Colorado&apos;s work in plain language revision of Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) items has been extensive.Using statewide CSAP data for 2005 and 2007, this study examined how mathematics assessment items, once revised for plain language, performed compared to the original, unrevised version of the item. Access for English Language Learners was a focal point for this study. Plain language revision was evaluated for its effects on item difficulty, item discrimination, DIF and DOK.DOK ratings from 2005 and 2007 were compared using Chi&amp;ndashsqaure. One sample t&amp;ndashtests were used to examine the differences in DIF and item difficulty (p&amp;ndashvalue), as well as item discrimination for ELLs and Non&amp;ndashELLs comparing the 2005 non&amp;ndashrevised items with the 2007 revised items. Unrevised items were used as controls. Revised items were classified by type of linguistic change. Each type of change was examined using ANOVA to determine if a specific type of change effected differences in DIF and item difficulty.While results indicate little if any difference in item performance at individual grade levels, overall LEP performance on revised items was higher than on non&amp;ndashrevised items, a change in performance not present for non-ELLs. This may indicate that plain language revision continues to hold promise as a best practice for item development. As an accommodation, however, it appears that plain language revision alone may not be sufficient to ensure access to assessment items for ELLs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act changed assessment for English Language Learners (ELLs). Under the law, states must validly assess ELLs&apos; English Language Proficiency (ELP) and content knowledge. The law shed light on the achievement of ELLs while also creating challenges for states in validating state assessment and accountability systems. Test accommodations are used for ELLs to reduce threats to test score validity and measure academic achievement as accurately and fairly as possible. Since ELLs are working towards proficiency in English, they face linguistic and socio-cultural barriers under the confines of large scale assessment. A limited body of research regarding accommodations for ELLs exists, but has inconclusive findings that do not factor in student background variables. This study examined to what extent linguistic accommodation led to improvement in test performance of ELLs using ELP scores from the Colorado English Language Acquisition Assessment (CELApro) and Mathematics scores from the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) along with student background variables. The results of this study suggest that Translated Oral Scripts seemed to make the biggest difference for all grade levels in terms of association with higher CSAP performance. Students using Word-to-Word Dictionaries also showed increased performance for grades eight and ten. Grades three through seven were not included for this accommodation because of small sample sizes. Oral Scripts and Teacher Read Directions were associated with positive score increases for some grades and negative score drops for others. Students with lower levels of English proficiency tended to benefit more from receiving accommodations than students with higher proficiency. Analyzing the accommodations by grade also revealed differential accommodation effects. Third grade students receiving Translated Oral Scripts had higher CSAP scores than their non-accommodated peers, those using regular Oral Scripts benefitted slightly, while the effects of Teacher Read directions and Extended Timing appear to be worse than receiving No Accommodation for this sample. In grade ten, it did not matter what accommodations students received--none seemed to be associated with student performance.While the analyses showed that for the most part Teacher Read Directions, Extended Timing, and Oral Scripts were not significantly associated with Fluent-English Proficient (FEP) performance, it is unfortunate that the student samples receiving Translated Oral Scripts and Word-to-Word Dictionaries were insufficient in size to allow their inclusion. The FEP results may be due to the fact that FEPs no longer benefit from accommodations since they have a high level of ELP. Considering the significant role that assessment results have in guiding decisions about individuals and organizations, it is crucial to continue examining how to fairly assess ELLs while using systematic research-based practices.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The sanctions are mounting for those schools who are failing to meet federal, state, and local accountability requirements.  States and districts continue to spotlight schools that are considered underperforming for scrutiny.  As a result, staff within these schools often struggle with feelings of hopelessness and dissatisfaction.  Collective efficacy, the belief that an individual has about their own and their colleague&apos;s competencies to take on difficult tasks, has been found to be a significant predictor of student achievement.  Prior student achievement has also been shown to be highly correlated with the individual and collective efficacy of a school staff.  However, enhancing or sustaining the efficacy of educators in schools targeted for improvement year to year is challenging.  Research in this field is emerging and little is known about the factors that directly influence the collective efficacy of a school staff.This research examines the relationships that teacher pedagogical precision, the use and application of data to inform teaching for learning, and the principal&apos;s use of data with staff has on collective efficacy.  The mediating effects of changes in student achievement on the relationship between teacher and principal pedagogical precision and collective efficacy were also investigated.   Educators from 50 elementary, middle, and high schools in a large urban/suburban district participated in this cross-year study.  Survey and achievement results were collected three times throughout the school year and analyzed using structural equation modeling.The findings of this study indicate that there is a direct and significant impact on collective efficacy when teachers report higher uses of data to change instruction with an effect size of .908 (p&lt;.01) by spring.  Teachers&apos; perception of principals&apos; use of data had a positive effect size ranging from .795 in fall (p&lt;.001) to .409 in spring (p&lt;.001).   Results show that, as a school risk factor, socio-economic status had a significant, negative impact on individual teacher&apos;s perception of collective efficacy throughout the year (p&lt;001) but a small, significant, and positive impact on achievement in winter and spring (p&lt;.001).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Computational models of biomechanical systems can provide valuable insight into joint functionality and implant performance under conditions that are difficult to test in vivo or using in vitro experimental setups.  The main objective of this research was to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of explicit finite element (FE) based models to address current concerns in biomechanics.  Specifically, efficient probabilistic methods were applied to evaluate the effects of inherent system uncertainties on output measures, and custom user subroutines and optimization algorithms were incorporated within the FE framework to develop muscle-actuated dynamic models.  
	
A probabilistic FE model of the Stanmore knee simulator was developed.  Inputs to the model included International Organization for Standardization (ISO) force-controlled gait loading conditions, along with normal distributions of component alignment, loading and environmental parameters representing uncertainty associated with the experimental setup.  The model predicted distributions of output measures, including 1 and 99 percentile bounds of joint kinematics, range of motion, peak contact pressure, and linear and gravimetric wear.  Sensitivity of the performance metrics to input parameters were reported to identify the important input parameters.
	 
Three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of the lower extremity were developed.  A probabilistic model was used to evaluate the effects of muscle attachment location uncertainty and joint kinematic variability on moment arm predictions from different estimating techniques.  Muscle-actuated dynamic FE models were created to simulate activities driven by direct forces or forces calculated from muscle parameters and activations data.  Inputs to the FE models included patient anthropometry data, muscle and soft-tissue properties, contact definitions, and muscle parameters based on a Hill-type model.  The models were optimized for muscle forces or activations to reproduce kinematic signatures representing knee flexion and chair rise activities.  Outputs of the models included joint reaction forces, ligament loads, and tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics and contact pressures.  The computational framework developed represents a novel methodology to perform comparative studies of joint behavior and implant designs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines the capacity of financial aid type and student need level to predict undergraduate student persistence at the University of Denver. Studies that have measured the influence of financial aid on persistence have had varying results. This may be a function of the institution under investigation, the population investigated, or the combination of the various types of aid. Focusing on one institution, the University of Denver, provides administrators with specific information about the practice of leveraging aid dollars to promote undergraduate student persistence. This study used a quantitative research design. Measures of central tendency were conducted to determine the characteristics of the student population. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if undergraduate student persistence could be predicted based on what type of financial aid a student receives and what level of need the student had upon entering the University. Findings indicate that type of financial aid does not predict persistence at year one or year four. Student need level only marginally predicts persistence at year one and when type of aid and need level are considered together only work-study is a predictor of persistence for year one. Models for year two, three, and graduation did not produce a goodness of fit for the logistic regression models, therefore the findings remain inconclusive. The outcome of this investigation provides the University of Denver administration with data for basing their decisions about the use of financial aid to address student financial need in order to promote persistence.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Nicole Pleasant-ImmanuelTitle:  Finding My Way: Increasing Self-Awareness and Self-Goal Setting Among African American YouthAdvisors: Howard J. Markman and Scott M. StanleyDegree Date: August 2008ABSTRACTMarriage has been found to be beneficial to men, women and children of all races, but many African Americans do not experience these benefits as 70% of African American children are born to an unwed mother.  While there is a general trend among all ethnic groups to have more accepting attitudes toward nonmarital childbearing and high expectations for marriage in the 20th century, these attitudes have had a greater impact on the childbearing behavior of African Americans largely due to the strong association between neighborhood economic disadvantage and nonmarital childbearing.  African-Americans are more likely to come from an impoverished neighborhood than other ethnic groups and attitudes have been found to be a mediator between neighborhood economic disadvantage and nonmarital births.  In addition, there are very few programs available to African-American youth that teaches skills and principles associated with and increases confidence in creating a healthy, happy long-term relationship.The major aims of the present study were to introduce an intervention to an adolescent population in order to increase relationship skill development and influence attitudes regarding marriage and childbearing.  Ideally, participating African American youth would demonstrate increased communication skills, increased confidence in having a healthy long-term relationship and endorse attitudes more accepting of childbearing in the context of marriage and economic stability.Fifty-seven African American high school students were the participants in this feasibility study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a new intervention, Finding My Way.  This preventative intervention was designed to increase self-awareness and self-goal setting; positive relationship characteristics (constructive communication, relationship confidence, and relationship satisfaction); the endorsement for childbearing within the context of marriage and/or economic stability; and the use of contraception during sexual intercourse.   The study used a quasi-experimental design with a treatment as usual control group.The results of this study showed that Finding My Way was effective at modifying the childbearing attitudes of older youth such that participants endorsed a greater acceptance for childbearing within the context of marriage and/or economic stability and reported greater use of protection during sexual intercourse as compared to the treatment as usual group.   There was a trend for those in the Finding My Way group to show greater self-awareness and self-goal setting when thinking of a romantic partner but no other significant effects of the intervention were found.  This lack of other significant effects of the intervention may have been due to many factors including challenges delivering the intervention within a community-based context, a strong treatment as usual comparison condition, and relatively small sample sizes.While many of the proposed effects of Finding My Way were not found, the results indicate that this intervention can be successfully delivered within a community-based context and impact the attitudes and behavior of African-American youth.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Fire is a critical process in altering belowground resources in terrestrial ecosystems.  It has been found that soil nutrients increase, decrease, or remain the same following fire. Thus, in an attempt to elucidate the ambiguity surrounding this paradox, meta-analysis was used to comprehensively and quantitatively review empirical studies to detect overall patterns of soil nutrient response after fire in varying biotic and abiotic conditions. The results suggested that fire increases available soil N, plant-available P, extractable P and pH.  In contrast, total soil nutrient pools had mixed responses with no change in total N, reductions in total carbon (C), and significant increases in total P, which ultimately influence the overall sustainability of soil resources.  In addition, the results of the meta-analysis indicated that significant fire-induced responses vary with one or several different biotic and abiotic conditions.  Hence fire-induced soil nutrient responses varied by vegetation type, fire category, ignition seasonality, time since fire, soil texture, and soil depth.Cheatgrass invasion in Great Basin sagebrush-grassland communities has rapidly increased and brought fire with it.  Therefore, I examined the role fire has on influencing the spatial patterning of soil nutrients in cheatgrass invaded sagebrush soils.  The results indicated that available N and P, total N, total C, and pH increased after prescribed burning in sagebrush habitat containing invasive cheatgrass.  In addition, the lack of spatial differentiation in surface and mineral soil temperature regimes indicated that a ubiquitous cover of cheatgrass may have reduced the spatial heterogeneity of this sagebrush habitat, and as a result, soil nutrients responded similarly to fire under shrub canopy, under shrub dripline, and at shrub interspace.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The performance of a typical International Space Station (ISS) shield against the meteoroid and orbital debris (M/OD) impact threat is generally modeled by damage equations for the outer shield and the rear pressure wall. In their current forms, these damage equations neglect the on-orbit temperature extremes witnessed by the ISS.  To address IF and HOW temperature extremes affect the performance of the ISS&apos; typical M/OD shield, a comprehensive study was undertaken that investigated hole diameters in .063&quot; thick 6061-T6 aluminum targets impacted at velocities from ~2-7 km/s at 20ºC, 110ºC, and 210ºC.Robust graphical and analytical analyses confirmed the existence of a statistically significant temperature effect, i.e., hole diameters in heated targets were larger than those in room temperature targets. A new temperature-dependent model was found via multivariable regression analysis that incorporates a linear velocity term and a temperature term based on a form of the cumulative distribution function.Numerical modeling of hypervelocity impacts (HVI) into elevated temperature targets was also performed to determine whether or not currently available material and failure models can adequately simulate the differences observed between room and elevated temperature target hole diameters. Statistical analyses showed that AUTODYN simulated the heated data almost as well as the room temperature data.  However, the slightly worse Goodness of Fit (GOF) values between the heated empirical vs. simulated comparisons suggest that the simulations do not completely account for the observed temperature effect.A series of materials tests and observations were carried out on the post-impacted target plates to help explain the empirical data results with respect to material variability and deformation features.  Rockwell B and K macro-hardness tests revealed that the hardness values for the targets impacted at 110°C were statistically significantly higher compared to those targets impacted at 20°C and 210°C.  Since hole diameters are expected to increase with target temperature, this observation suggests that a less ductile failure mode was involved for the 110°C holes compared to the room temperature and 210°C holes.  Polished micrographs of select 110°C impact hole cross-sections support the idea that these targets failed in spall in a less ductile manner compared to the 20°C and 210°C targets.Current orbital debris (OD) environment predictions are based, in large part, on in-situ damage of spacecraft surfaces, but do not relate observed surface damage to their temperature at the time of the impact.  A first-order prediction was calculated to quantify how much elevated temperature bumpers could potentially affect ORDEM2000 flux predictions, and ultimately the risk of impact.  By failing to take into account that larger hole diameters are created in heated targets, ORDEM2000 potentially overestimates the risk of impact by particles in the 3mm range of the environment by at least 68%.  These calculations show that, in this range, a small error in predicted particle diameter can result in a significant difference in the predicted orbital debris particle flux and risk of impact.  To the extent that these effects are true for other spacecraft surfaces, spacecraft designs may be over-conservative due to an overprediction of large particles in the OD environment.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>&quot;I Will Be King Over You&quot;: The Rhetoric of Divine Kingship in the Book of Ezekiel</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation provides a rhetorical analysis of the motif of Yahweh&apos;s kingship in the Book of Ezekiel.  Drawing upon Aristotle&apos;s The Art of Rhetoric and more recent adaptations and elaborations of classical rhetorical theory, the focus is placed upon the role of Yahweh&apos;s kingship in the argumentative strategies and argumentative purposes of the Ezekiel corpus.The dissertation performs the following tasks: Chapter 1 explains the classical rhetorical method to be employed throughout the project; Chapter 2 provides a basic survey of the rhetorical arrangement, genre, and purpose of Ezekiel; Chapter 3 explores the rhetorical situation or crisis for which Ezekiel serves as a rhetorical response; Chapter 4 examines the role of divine kingship in the visions of Ezek 1-3, 8-11, and 40-48, and discusses its relationship to the motif of divine abandonment and return; Chapters 5-7 examine the motif of Yahweh&apos;s kingship in Ezek 20, in the oracles against the nations (specifically Ezek 28:11-19 and Ezek 31), and in Ezek 34, respectively, and explain the relationship of these units to the transitional material in Ezek 33; Chapter 8 is a summary and conclusion.The dissertation argues that a major concern of the Book of Ezekiel is rebuilding the ethos of Yahweh among the Israelite exilic community in Babylon.  This is especially evident in those sections that implicitly and explicitly employ the motif of Yahweh&apos;s kingship. Ezekiel argues that Yahweh is the Great King (a central tenet of the Zion tradition) by emphasizing Yahweh&apos;s universal sovereignty and his universal exercise of justice.  The text also encourages covenant faithfulness among the exiles in an effort to preserve their unique identity as Yahweh&apos;s patrons.  The rhetorical foundation for accomplishing this is the clarification of Yahweh&apos;s character, which seeks to build the deity&apos;s reputation as honorable and trustworthy, in spite of the disasters of the Babylonian exile and the destruction of Jerusalem.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Terrorism scholars have posited that 90 percent of terrorist groups survive less than a year, and half of those which remain will not live to see the ten year-mark. This dissertation addresses the variety of means through which terrorist groups seek to acquire, move and store money, tangible and intangible resources, and how these strategies shape their autonomy in conducting operations and theoretical capabilities to engage in violent actions. The combination of a terrorist group&apos;s capability and autonomy leads to the identification of seven different categories: state-sponsored terrorist groups, franchises, popularly-supported groups, lone wolves, state-sponsoring groups, shell states and transnational corporation-like groups (TNCs). Within these groups, those with medium to high levels of both autonomy and capability are proven to have the highest average lifespan.Utilizing the Terrorism Knowledge Base database, 100 terrorist groups out of a total of 897 were examined. Each was coded according to its level of autonomy (measured as low, medium or high) and capability (measured as very low, low, medium or high) with respect to the conduct of terrorist actions; the longevity of each group was determined from the time of its first terrorist attack until the most recent one. Statistical analysis utilizing a Weibull distribution verifies that those groups with medium to high capability and autonomy do indeed achieve a longer lifespan than those with only low capabilities and/or low autonomy. Moreover, the sample indicates that the average lifespan for all terrorist groups may be much longer than what terrorism scholars have anticipated.This dissertation addresses four significant gaps in the literature on terrorism. First, it provides a typology for examining the resourcing of terrorism, as none currently exists. Second, it analyzes how the institution of terrorism resourcing has evolved over time and how new institutional variations influence groups&apos; autonomy and capability. Third, as the above criteria correlate to the lifespan of individual terrorist groups, this dissertation explains why some outfits are more likely to survive and flourish while others are short-lived.  Finally, this study develops objective criteria for measuring the capability and autonomy of terrorist organizations.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Impact of Pluralistic Mentoring at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA)</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Academic research demonstrates the importance of implementing measures to enhance human diversity and to ensure campus environments are truly inclusive. Literature on mentoring consistently demonstrates its importance in facilitating the opportunities for students to achieve greater levels of academic success, fulfillment, and human development. However, literature merging principles of human diversity with principles of mentoring is somewhat scarce. The direction of this dissertation was an attempt to develop a pluralistic mentoring program at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), which would bridge diversity initiatives with good mentoring practices. More importantly, research was conducted to assess the impact of pluralistic mentoring at the USAFA. Jim Cummins&apos;s (2001), Empowering Minority Students: Framework for Intervention enabled the researcher to develop a program that could be incorporated into the Officer Development System (ODS) at USAFA and within the Dean of Faculty advising and mentoring program.The research demonstrated both a qualitative emphasis with historical analysis conducted before and during the development and training of pluralistic mentors, and a quantitative emphasis that explored the impact of pluralistic mentoring upon the cadets&apos; attitudes toward diversity and pluralism. Additionally, the historical research phase enabled the researcher to contemplate the etic issues (presuppositions and philosophical positions gleaned from theory and literature) and to consider the emic issues (the discovery from acquaintance with the case) before accomplishing the quantitative research.  The researcher explored a bounded situation at the USAFA: the new Officer Development System, which was unveiled in January 2004 to change the culture and the mechanisms for developing future officers. Thus, the Academy&apos;s leadership, culture, and socialization processes were examined and juxtaposed with the relevant literature regarding human diversity and mentoring principles. Although the new program did not achieve the desired level of impact, improvement of implementation and execution strategies should allow pluralistic mentoring to complement existing programs that professionally develop cadets at the USAFA. Moreover, pluralistic mentoring, when fully embraced, will enable the Academy to produce culturally competent and socially conscious officers who will become Air Force leaders of the twenty-first century.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine if the academic, financial, or institutional variables successfully predicted undergraduate persistence in first year, second year, and third year private scholarship recipients. This study also explored if student retention was predicted uniquely for members of different races/ethnicities and/or genders. Three-way interactions between persistence, the independent variables, and the moderator variables were examined. Ideally, this study aimed to advance the limited research regarding scholarship persistence and provide some information to increase retention of this unique and growing population.A series of logistic regression analyses were utilized to explore the main research questions. The following variables were statistically significant in predicting the persistence of scholarship recipients: high school GPA, college GPA, Daniels Fund Scholarship award, EFC, Federal Pell grant, other scholarship awards, work study, institutional control, cost of attendance, institutional size, institutional diversity, and geographical location. However, the statistically significant variables predicting student retention varied by year in college, gender, and race/ethnicity. Academic variables showed relevance earlier in a scholar&apos;s college career, while financial variables were more relevant in later years. Institutional variables showed a mild direct influence on persistence particularly for female students.  The independent variables that created a statistically significant interaction with gender and race/ethnicity included: high school GPA, aptitude test scores, Daniels Fund Scholarship award, work study, institutional type, institutional diversity, institutional type, institutional control, institutional size, institutional quality, and cost of attendance.Several recommendations for future research were drawn from the literature and the study findings including 1) segregating the population into subgroups for analysis, 2) examining possible two-way and three-way interaction effects between the independent variables, moderator variables, and persistence, 3) analyzing persistence by academic year, and 4) exploring how different types and combinations of financial aid variables influence the persistence of scholarship recipients. Additionally, three recommendations were offered for private scholarship providers including 1) all scholarship recipients are created equal, but they are not equal, 2) know not only your scholars but the institutions they are attending, and 3) customize scholarships based upon the students&apos; total financial aid package and individual scholar information.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Instructions on the Removal of Birds from the Head is a work of fiction composed of fragments, anecdotes, self-contained stories, unfinished stories, lists, and vignettes--all of which  relate to an unknown disease that surfaces among the populace in an unknown country.  The book  details the disease&apos;s many and seemingly unrelated symptoms, the stories of patients and presumed patients&apos; experience with the disease, the attempt by four doctors to understand and diagnose it, and the world that created it.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>For some years, Japan has pursued its own missile defense system in cooperation with the United States. The Japanese government claims that the missile defense (JMD) program is purely defensive and will not pose a threat to other countries. JMD may seem justified by North Korea&apos;s development of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. However, neighboring states regarded it as a sign of military ambition and revival of Japan&apos;s prewar militarism. The development and deployment of JMD could have grave implications for regional and global security. This dissertation focuses on these implications, domestic and international political considerations and the future direction of Japan&apos;s defense and security policy.After the Cold War, when the superpowers maintained strategic stability with massive offensive nuclear arsenals (mutual assured destruction--MAD), new threats from rogue states and terrorists have forced us to rethink the credibility of MAD. But attempts to build shields against nuclear ballistic missiles could trigger a new phase of the arms race pitting offensive vs. defensive capabilities. The author argues that defense must be emphasized in order to achieve stability and security (mutual defense emphasis--MDE). Characterization of JMD as truly defensive or not depends on theoretical and strategic viewpoints. The key is the distinction between defense and offense, and whether Japan will emphasize defense, and convince other states that its strategic intentions are really defensive.For the Japanese, with their dual realist and pacifist identities, JMD can be a tool of either realist military strategy or pacifist arms control. Japan should choose defensive realism, including MDE arms control, as a middle way that may eventually open a pacifist route to disarmament. With the world&apos;s most sophisticated technology and a tradition of pacifism, Japan is in a unique and advantageous position to promote arms control.In pursuit of JMD, the Japanese government should not only promote arms control and MDE--building missile shields against rogue and terrorist missile attacks or accidental or unauthorized launches, but also advance offensive arms reduction among major states. Japan can and must become a leader in such a shift toward a less dangerous world.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project studies the ideational factors influencing Japanese foreign aid policy. It builds on previous research in political science on perception and foreign policy decision-making, Japanese political economy, economic and technological development, foreign aid, and in anthropology on perception, worldview, and international development.The main goal of the research is to answer the question of how Japan&apos;s historical experiences with technology, development, and foreign relations (and key leaders&apos; views of those areas) from 1850 to 1945 have influenced current aid policies. Second, the project aims to answer whether the Japanese development concepts of &quot;modernization,&quot; internationalization and translative adaptation accurately reflect Japan&apos;s own experience. Third, the project asks how spirituality and religion may be influencing current aid policies.In the research, I review key contexts of Japan&apos;s historical experience from 1850 to 1945 in several important areas. I also study the beliefs and worldviews (cognitive frameworks) of seven key Japanese leaders for the same period: Fukuzawa Yukichi, Mori Arinori, Ito Hirobumi, Yamagata Aritomo, Kato Hiroyuki, Yanagita Kunio, and Emperor Hirohito. I analyze these historical experiences and leaders&apos; views through analytical concepts and lenses from political science, anthropology, and economics, in three main areas: development, technology, and cognition.Among my key findings are that there is much continuity between Japan&apos;s prewar culture of politics and the postwar system, including examples and ideas, which shape the policy environment in which Japan&apos;s aid operates. Many of these are negative in nature, and some are ideas based on Japan&apos;s own development experience. Several key lessons emerge, including the importance of: 1) a strong civil society to prevent abusive politics for the achievement of Japan&apos;s national interests, whether in its prewar politics or the current aid system; 2) a strong, effective state for encouraging successful development; 3) Japan&apos;s development experience for other regions (if carefully applied); and 4) the concept of translative adaptation, the idea that each nation&apos;s development must be customized for its own conditions and experiences. I conclude that Japan needs better consideration of ground level factors in its assessments of ODA policy and international affairs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current research examines the U.S. Senate transcripts of the 2006 USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization debates.  In particular, the study identifies how objections to reauthorization were raised and advance by opponents as well as the subsequent responses by advocates of the legislation.  The arguments were analyzed from a pragmatic justificatory perspective which was augmented with three additional theories--collective imagining, strategic maneuvering and political reasonableness.  Three primary arguments emerged within the discourse of the opposition.  The first concerned particular legal flaws within the Act and proposed amendments, the second involved the ideal of liberty, and the third dealt with the manipulation of Senate processes and procedures.  It was discovered that both opponents and advocates drew upon notions of the reasonable when arguing their positions and maneuvered strategically to in order advance their agendas.  The arguments which were deemed strongest, most closely adhered to the six principles of pragmatic justification.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Applications that deal with large sets of Moving Objects (MOs) continue to
grow, and so does the demand for an efficient data management and query processing systems supporting MOs. Application examples include location-based services, transportation management and mobile networks, which require an efficient database management system that is able to store, update, and query a large
number of continuously changing MOs. Major challenges for developing such
systems are due to the fact that the actual data object reports its state, which is associated with one or more properties (e.g., geographic location and velocity), that can continuously change over time, however, it is only possible to discretely record the object&apos;s states. All the missing or non-recorded states collectively form
the uncertainty of the object&apos;s history.This dissertation reviews existing uncertainty models and proposes a more efficient model called the Tornado model that reduces the size of uncertainty regions resulting in less false hits, thus improving the efficiency of the database management
system. The Tornado model resulted in an average reduction of 94% in the uncertainty volume over the Cone model - one of the most common uncertainty models in spatiotemporal databases.To be practically viable, each uncertainty model must be paired with appropriate approximations of uncertainty regions that can be used for indexing. This is due to the two-phase query processing system consisting of the refinement phase
and the filtering phase. In this dissertation, we propose Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) approximations for three uncertainty models including the Tornado
model; we also propose an estimated MBR for the Tornado model that achieves a good balance between accuracy and computation efficiency. The estimated MBR of the Tornado model reduced the number of false hits by 29% on average over the Cone model.Finally, this dissertation presents the Truncated Tornado model - an uncertainty model as a significant advance in minimizing uncertainty regions associated with MOs. This model achieves the reduction in uncertainty regions by removing
sub-areas that are unreachable considering the maximum velocity and acceleration of the MOs. We combine the Truncated Tornado model with an approximation technique called Tilted Minimum Bounding Box (TMBB) to make the indexing of the uncertainty regions more efficient. Experimental results showed that the Truncated
Tornado in TMBB resulted in an average volume reduction of 96% over the
axis-parallel MBB of the Cone model.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>MENTORING DIALOGUES: AN INVESTIGATION OF THE DIALECTICAL TENSIONS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In the past 30 years, mentoring has gained perhaps the largest recognition of any phenomenon related to career success. Much of the current research that has explored mentoring relationships has been conducted in fields other than communication studies, although better communication is often the recommended solution to improve mentoring. The majority of research has focused on the outcomes of mentoring relationships, rather than the process of mentoring relationships. Mentoring has also not been studied through a relational dialectics perspective. This study explored the communication dynamics within mentoring relationships through a relational dialectics theoretical lens. The study utilized multiple methods including prompted joint conversations as well as individual interviews. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis (Owen, 1984). Significant findings include eight dialectical tensions constituted in mentoring relationships: openness-with and closedness-with, openness-to and closedness-to, integration and separation, stability and change, equality and hierarchy, individual goals and organizational goals, personal and professional, and structure and flexibility. Five management strategies were also discovered: spiraling inversion, segmentation, reaffirmation, balance, and denial. The identification of these tensions and management strategies led to a greater understanding of mentoring relationships, built on existing research to highlight the complexity in mentoring relationships, as well as supported the conceptualization of relational dialectics theory.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Organizational Changes and Problem-Based Learning Curriculum in Dental Education:  A Case Study of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine</dc:title>

  <dc:description>ABSTRACT This qualitative case study explored processes of planned organizational change at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) to implement its Problem-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum from 1991 to 2005.  Van de Ven&apos;s (1995) teleological change theory was used to examine this administrative and faculty collaborative process, led by its new Dean Bruce Donoff.  Dramatically, they reorganized the School by reducing its 11 departments to 5 and shifting its traditional five-year curriculum to a four-year small group, peer learning, and problem based oriented professional education.  A new Office of Dental Education with its learning specialist dean led the implementation.  These developments reflected earlier changes at Harvard&apos;s Medical School, where dental students completed their first two years, national calls for change in dental education, and emerging changes in dental education internationally.  This successful comprehensive curricular change sets a new model for professional dental education in the United States.    Primary data came from 13 interviews, documents, faculty minutes, and catalogues to create a narrative overview through three lenses of history, events, and interview analyses to describe the organizational and curricular change.  Nvivo v.8 assisted with data analysis revealing organizational process themes.  These themes corresponded to Van de Ven&apos;s theory:  (1) basis for engagement in PBL implementation; (2) methods used to drive PBL implementation; (3) diagnosis of ongoing organizational problems; (4) communication of vision, mission, objectives, and strategic plan; (5) rewards used to motivate individuals in the implementation of PBL; (6) roles played by the leaders to implement PBL curriculum; and (7) the effects of curriculum change on the cost of dental education.  Donoff&apos;s leadership was cited as the pivotal factor in this effort.  His collaborative team efforts with other leaders (namely, dean and the assistant dean of the Office of Dental Education, the director of curriculum development, and department heads), faculty, and staff were key elements in this organizational and curricular change.   This research is significant, because it is the first indepth study of organizational change to implement PBL curriculum at any dental school.  The narrative results offer dental educators a model for introducing PBL to improve dental practice for the 21st century.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Joshua Carey Coleman Title: Orthodoxy and the Existential Recovery of Liberation Theology Advisor: Frank Seeburger Degree Date: March 2008 Abstract Past liberation theology has sought to reemphasize the concerns of the poor by recovering a union between theory and praxis in theological discourse. In doing this, Liberation thought has shied away from strands of asceticism that devalue the body and its needs. However, by focusing on the Augustinian tradition and ignoring alternative approaches, liberation thought has unduly relied on political theory when in fact ascetic theology is crucial to its overall aims. In adumbrating transformative action within asceticism, I will refer to the 4th century Cappadocian Fathers and their understanding of the person as an hypostasis, distinguishing this relational aspect of personhood from Augustine. By incorporating the doctrine of the Divine Energies from the Christian East, we see in St. Dionysius that the further the person climbs the ascetic ladder the more diverse and unique the experience of God and of oneself. This establishes a radically different option for communion and difference between particular persons. This also makes care for &quot;these least&quot; part and parcel of communion for all involved, for care giver and receiver, helping both overcome needs as drives. This understanding of communion leaves behind Marxist/materialist understandings of the masses and rather incorporates freedom and particularity in personhood. I will refer to Hannah Arendt&apos;s The Human Condition to establish that the rise of the social realm since Antiquity is largely due to the development of the nation-state and its reliance on a scientific methodology that grossly compromises human subjectivity. Thus political science, in the way Aristotle understood it as including both the particular and the universal, is no longer possible. However, this uncovering is not in itself sufficient for theological subjectivity, as the particular in a particular/universal dialectic is not strictly analogous to hypostasis/communion in a patristic dialectic. Of the many implications in Arendt&apos;s work, most important here are two: the co-opting of nature into property within Antiquity and the subsequent wealth-value given to property through the rise of the social realm as the predominate means of accessing the polis. For theology to say anything other than political theory, the doctrine of the Divine Energies are crucial to care for the particularities of &quot;these least&quot; and to avoid positing another ideology of post-enlightenment reason that is part of the continued split between theory and practice, creation and God. The Divine Energies make clear that spiritual discernment is not merely intellectual reflection, but participation in the eschaton who participates in this world. To &quot;be not of this world&quot; allows a deeper entry into the world and not independence from creation, as the doctrine of the Divine Energies emphasizes that creation is God&apos;s dwelling. This understanding is the first step toward overcoming subject/object being and to realize that communion with God and persons is necessary for one&apos;s own particular personhood. An important historical example of this occurs within the Jewish feast of Tabernacles which, made clear through the Christian feast of Palm Sunday, is an example of how recognition of the divine, specifically through liturgical action, is tied up with the delegation of resources and care for the poor.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: D. Bruce KimeTitle: Outdoor Adventure Education Instructor Teaching in Postsecondary EducationSettings: Educational Connoisseurship and Criticism Case Studies in Canada, NewZealand, and the United StatesAdvisor: P Bruce Uhrmacher, Ph.D.Degree Date: June 2008ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study was to investigate postsecondary faculty teaching inoutdoor and adventure education programs from a qualitative perspective. Theinstructor&apos;s role in instructional processes has been recognized as important in the fieldsof outdoor leadership, outdoor education, and adventure education in proprietary and notfor-profit entities, yet studies have not been conducted that specifically focused onfaculty teaching in postsecondary settings. This study was international in nature, withparticipants from higher education institutions in Canada, New Zealand, and the UnitedStates.The study utilized the Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship methodology asa qualitative research lens. Data were gathered through first-hand observations of facultyteaching, audio-taping, personal interviews, hand notes, and document analysis. Eachfaculty person was observed teaching a minimum of fifty-nine hours. Observations tookplace in classroom and field settings as part of courses in guiding leadership, ski tourguiding, backpacking and natural history, teaching skills, and exercise physiology duringan Eco-Challenge activity.The findings of the study indicate that the participants viewed themselves as bothoutdoor leaders and educators. The faculty in this study were master practitioners in sixoverarching areas of teaching: the curriculum, the teaching environment, the learner&apos;siiiintensity, holistic assessment, instructional intentions, and adaptability to variables in theteaching setting. The emergent themes from the study led to the formulation of a sixdimensionaltheory of postsecondary outdoor adventure education. The implications forpractice from the findings hold relevance for undergraduate students in outdoorleadership, outdoor education, adventure education programs, and for interdisciplinarypostsecondary teaching.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Accurate, in situ measurement of airborne particles is critical in understanding the global atmosphere. An airborne instrument is designed to sample and measure the aerodynamic diameter of particles in the size range of 1-30 mm. Knowledge of the aerodynamic size of a particle includes the impact of unknown variables such as shape, size and density of a particle. Particles of the same aerodynamic diameter have the same trajectory and settling velocity in air, regardless of their actual size, density or shape. Knowing the time a particle resides in air can improve the climate models substantially.The developed instrument consists of a low turbulence inlet and a laser-Doppler velocimeter to sample and measure the super-micron particles all in one unit. Air enters the inlet at true air speed of the aircraft, which is a relatively high speed in the range of 100-200 ms-1. The low turbulence inlet reduces the air speed to 5-10 ms-1 in a short distance without generation of additional turbulence. It uses boundary layer suction through a porous diffuser to remove a substantial amount of air that is responsible for turbulence generation and particle loss in deposition to the inlet walls. Reduction of turbulence makes it possible to model and solve the flows inside the inlets and calculate the particle trajectories using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools.A new technique is developed to determine the size distribution of particles based on the motion of particles and measurement of the particles&apos; velocity. Velocimetric measurement of particle size is achieved by slowing the velocity of the flow that is carrying the particles and measuring the velocity of the particles in response to this change. Larger particles have higher tendency to continue at a higher speed, while smaller particles tend to follow the air stream lines. A laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measures the velocity of the particles as they pass through the viewing volume of the velocimeter. The aerodynamic diameter of the particles and their concentration is determined from the velocity measurements.Accurate determination of particle size distribution at the location of measuring sensor does not guarantee the accuracy of the ambient size distribution. The modification of number of particle due to particle loss, enhancement, and particles bouncing off the leading edge of the inlet is considered to accurately measure the ambient size distribution of particles.This research work also focuses on quantifying the effects of particle enhancement in the low turbulence inlet used in ACE-Asia sampling inlet and the deposition of particles in transport through the bends of ACE-Asia and NOAA inlets. The effect of force of gravity on deposition efficiency of particles has also been analyzed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Pelagius and Galatians:  An Ascetic Approach to Grace and Human Effort</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Throughout history, Pelagius has often been regarded as the opponent of divine grace in the process of salvation, giving greater emphasis to human effort.  He has been defined primarily by the later Augustinian debates. Yet, prior to 412, Pelagius was a well respected ascetic teacher in Rome.  Further, Pelagius was noted for his commentaries on the Pauline Epistles.  These two roles, then, provide an important lens for discerning Pelagius&apos; thought.In this project, one of Pelagius&apos; Pauline Commentaries, Galatians, is examined through the lens of asceticism.  Using the Valantasis theory of asceticism, the commentary reflects performances that aim to develop a new subjectivity in the ascetic; as well as re-define social relationships and construct a symbolic universe to develop and maintain the new identity.  In this ascetic formation it becomes clear that both divine initiative and human effort play an important role, for Pelagius, in the development of a new self.This divine/human synergism is revealed in Pelagius&apos; treatment of the Mosaic Law and faith, as well as in the ascetic program developed within the commentary.  Thus, a new picture, beyond that of the opposite of Augustinian thought, emerges for reading Pelagius.  The Commentary reveals an ascetic teacher who would be equally concerned about the role of divine initiative and human effort in the process of ascetic formation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Despite successful completion of coursework and comprehensive finals, many doctoral students are deterred from finishing their degree at the dissertation-phase, and are commonly referred to as ABDs (All But Dissertation).  ABDs are prevalent at many schools and within various disciplines of study, and non-completion can affect the individual both personally and professionally. The problem also reflects poorly on universities, and can create repercussions to society.&lt;br /&gt;	This study explored and isolated factors that inhibited or enabled the completion of the dissertation for three ABDs, and for three PhDs; all of whom were non-traditional age male students at one university, who pursued a PhD in Educational Administration, while being employed full-time.  A multiple case study was formulated through individual interviews, and cross-case analysis compared individuals from both categories of participants.  The primary factors that were investigated include: Personal and Professional Factors, Family and Peer Support, University Support, Campus Resources, Topic Selection, and Perfectionism and Procrastination.&lt;br /&gt;	Professional advancement, which is common among this category of participants, was cited as an inhibiting factor due to escalating job responsibilities causing less available free time for academic endeavors. This, coupled with the change from a structured learning environment with fixed demands on time to the non-structured, independent arena of the dissertation project, makes degree completion difficult. Topic selection was cited by all as the most important and challenging aspects of the dissertation process.  The study participants completed self-assessment surveys, which revealed moderate concern for perfectionism, but strong tendencies toward procrastination for two of the three ABDs.  To alleviate these and other inhibiting factors  explored in the study, recommendations are provided to ultimately yield more PhDs and fewer ABDs.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>PHENOMENOLOGY OF ANXIETY AND FEARS IN CLINICALLY ANXIOUS CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Background: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are at increased risk for developing anxiety disorders in childhood compared to typically developing children and to children with other developmental disabilities. Currently, many of the treatments that have been effectively used with children with clinical diagnoses of anxiety disorders, without a developmental disability (AD), are being applied and modified for children with ASD. However, there is a lack of research on the ways in which anxiety disorders may be similar and different in clinically anxious children with ASD compared to children with AD. It is important to make this comparison so that we can develop appropriate models for understanding the influence of the core symptoms of ASD on the development of anxiety disorders, and then further develop intervention programs that target the types of anxiety symptoms that clinically anxious children with ASD display. Methods: Anxiety symptoms in 19 children with ASD and anxiety disorders were compared to anxiety symptoms in 18 children with AD, matched on chronological age and verbal IQ. All participants were treatment-seeking or had parental concern for anxiety, and had clinical diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), and/or social phobia based on rating scales and interviews in the present study. Children participated in the study by completing questionnaires about their fear and anxiety symptoms, and their primary caregivers participated by completing questionnaires and a semi-structured interview about their children&apos;s anxiety symptoms, in order to assess differences in specific anxiety symptoms endorsed, severity and types of specific fears, and comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and with other emotional and behavioral difficulties. Results: Comparisons between children with AD and children with ASD on the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) showed similar types of anxiety symptoms, by both parent and child report. However, there were slight developmental delays in the types of most commonly reported anxiety symptoms by child self-report. On the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children (BASC) questionnaire, parents of children with comorbid ASD reported more severe problems of Attention and Adaptive Skills, whereas parents of children with AD reported more severe problems of Somatization. Comparisons between groups were also made on overall severity of fears on the Fear Survey Schedule-Revised (FSSC-R) and indicated similar overall fear severity scores, similar severity scores on fear subscales, and a similar proportion of children in each group who endorsed clinically significant levels of fears. Conclusions:  The findings of this study support an emerging body of research suggesting that clinically anxious children with ASD exhibit similar types of anxiety symptoms and fears as children with anxiety disorders, without developmental disabilities. It is likely that their difficulties related to having the core symptoms of ASD (i.e., social difficulties, language impairments, and perseverative behaviors) do not produce anxiety symptoms that are different from those of a subset of children who have GAD, SAD, and/or Social Phobia. Measurement, treatment, and phenomenological reasons for this are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The use of various polymer supports adhering phospholipid multibilayers to an internal reflection element have been investigated. The polymer supports studied range from polystyrene (PS), and 100 nm wide PS nanospheres to triethylaminated poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) (PVBC). The PS nanospheres showed the most promise as an adhesion layer since they appear to be the most robust with repeated washings. They also appear to stabilize their adjacent phospholipid multibilayer by increasing the lipid melting temperature. The triethylaminated DVBC also provided an increase of lipid melting temperature, but not quite to the same degree as the PS nanospheres. The cooperativity of such systems is much greater than without an adhesion layer. It is believed that in the case of PS nanospheres, a slight negative charge interacts with the polar head groups of the phospholipid multibilayer, thus leading to an increase in cooperativity. The triethylaminated DVBC is believed to interdigitate between the phospholipid molecules in a way such that the positively charged nitrogen atom interacts directly with the negatively charged phosphate group located on the phospholipid molecules, thus giving rise to its relatively high cooperativity and lower melting temperature than the uncharged polymers and nanobeads. The PS nanosphere polymer support was shown to be an effective platform for biosensors. Myoglobin based biosensors, using PS nanosphere supports, showed that myoglobin retains its native ligand binding ability.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>There is a burgeoning literature regarding positive affect dysregulation in depression.  Specifically, individuals with depression show attenuation in initial affective responsiveness to positive events, as well as in the maintenance or enhancement of positive affect over time.  This study utilized a randomized controlled design to implement and evaluate an adaptation of the Written Disclosure Paradigm (WDP) that addresses positive affect dysregulation.  This WDP adaptation--Positive Emotion Regulation Coaching (PERC)--is a cognitive treatment component designed to guide individuals with depressive symptoms to savor and make positive attributions for positive events.  Participants were 41 female college students with dysphoric symptoms.   Retention rates were high at 100%.  Also, the acceptability of the intervention was strong, as indicated by few rescheduled sessions and improved mood over the course of the writing sessions in the treatment group relative to active control.  There was a medium effect of PERC on depressive symptoms and a small effect of PERC on savoring.  Mechanistic variables for the effect of PERC on depressive symptoms were not successfully identified.  Results provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention and lay the foundation for future studies.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>QUANTIFYING THE VARIATION IN FOLIAR PHYSIOGNOMY ALONG ALTITUDINAL GRADIENTS IN AUSTRALIAN TROPICAL RAINFORESTS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>A number of studies have shown relationships between foliar physiognomic characters and climatic gradients are also present with variation in altitude. Few studies have explored these trends in foliar characters over a localized altitudinal gradient and none have repeated such collections on different gradients. This is an analysis of the foliar physiognomic variation seen over three localized altitudinal gradients in an Australian tropical rainforest environment. The study was based upon leaf litter collections and selected foliage samples. A unique aspect is the inclusion of two vine species in the exploration of physiognomic responses to altitude. Analysis of the leaf litter showed no significant variation in the number of species between altitudinal sites on two of the three gradients, or between either the percentage of leaves with entire margins. All three gradients showed significant variation in the percentage of entire margined species with varying altitude. Therefore, this study shows that species numbers are generally equally distributed with varying altitude, as well as leaf margin type measured on an individual specimen level. On a taxon level, it was found that there was a significant variation in entire margined species, but this variation did not have a linear relationship with altitude. Leaf size classes were found to have significant linear relationship with altitude on all three gradients. The smallest size class increased with increasing altitude, while the two larger classes decreased. Analysis of foliage from five selected species showed a wide range of responses between individual species with increasing altitude. Both vine species were found to have similar physiognomic responses to altitude as one of the tree species examined. These results suggest that intraspecific variations and changes in species composition are important factors controlling variation in foliar physiognomy across altitudinal gradients. Stomatal density increased with altiude for two of the three species examined, while the third decreased. This result shows that CO2 concentration may be a factor controlling stomatal density for some species, while for others it may not be important. Finally, experiments aimed to test whether there is correlation between the size of leaves and the distance they travel in rainforest streams showed that there is significant variation. With some exceptions, smaller species were found to travel further than large species. It was also found that fresh, green leaves consistently traveled further than dried leaves that had been rehydrated.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>RE-INSCRIBING THE BOUNDARIES OF FEMINIST RHETORIC THROUGH FREE LOVE: A FEMINIST RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF VICTORIA WOODHULL, EMMA GOLDMAN AND VOLTAIRINE DE CLEYRE</dc:title>

  <dc:description>As a practice of third way/ve feminist criticism, this dissertation identifies and challenges normative assumptions of gender which inform the disciplinary boundaries of feminist rhetorical history, theory and criticism by examining the free love rhetorics of Victoria Woodhull, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman. The rhetorics of free love posited, to varying degrees, that women&apos;s oppression began at the intimate and romantic level of husband and wife, and recommended that women&apos;s emancipation could be initiated with the abolition of marriage. Juxtaposed to suffrage, the prevalent narrative of the first wave, this analysis of the rhetorics of free love reveals that a fixed notion of gender defined by heterosexuality, republicanism and whiteness has transcended the &quot;waves&quot; of feminist activism. This fixed notion of gender has limited our ability to think, talk, and theorize about gender within feminist rhetorical criticism specifically, but also rhetoric generally. To address this limitation, I develop a &quot;third way/ve&quot; feminist theory which re-articulates the boundaries of feminist theory and criticism to account for the intersections of sexuality, citizenship and race in the constitution of feminist subjectivities. Finally, I conclude by developing a &quot;feminist style&quot; out of the rhetorics of free love that can account for those unconventional feminist rhetorics which initiate dissonance around collective notions of &quot;femininity,&quot; and challenge us to rethink what being &quot;woman&quot; means.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Korean military wives have been symbolized as &quot;dirty,&quot; &quot;nothing,&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; by Koreans, Korean Americans, and their American families. They also experience same level of oppression and discrimination within Korean American congregations. In Korea, the women suffered poverty, sexual violence, and Confucian gender discrimination. They have also experienced racial and sexual oppression, intercultural familial conflicts and violence, and identity crisis in America.All of those experiences are caused the sense of not belonging of Korean military wives.The sense of not belonging and desperation can be explained well by Andrew Sung Park&apos;s theology of han. The theology of han shows the han of the women can be resolved only as the offender are willing to stand in the solidarity with Korean military wives. Asian feminist theologians point out that Asian women experience God as life-giving power and ultimately seek to the full humanity in the image of God.Meanwhile, liberation psychology focuses on the socio-political aspects of human psychology. It argues that the primary purpose of psychology in Latin America should make Latin Americans critically confront of the oppressive and dominant social and political realities.Conscientization plays a critical role in developing my thesis. To practice of resistance and transformation, the process of conscientization is essential both to Korean American congregations and to Korean military wives. To Korean Americancongregations, they need to critically reflect upon their privilege, power, and unjust socio-cultural and religious structures. Korean military wives need to confront their hanful life realities and proclaim their full humanity in the image of God.Under the communal contextual approach of pastoral theology and care, I propose three pastoral strategies of Korean military wives: (1) Korean American congregations should be authentic resisting and transforming community, which is grounded in God&apos;s justice and life-giving power. (2) Korean American congregations need the power of de-powering and de-centering of power systems toward converting power abuse into creative power. Korean military wives also need to rediscover and develop pre-existing but unnoticed power or capacity within themselves. (3) Korean American congregations work together with Korean military wives to resist social injustice through transforming actions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the role of cultural indicators in moderating  the influence of perceived partner responses and relationship satisfaction on pain severity and depressive symptomatology among a sample of 62 married and cohabiting Mexican American men, the majority of whom were first generation Mexican Americans, with chronic back and/or neck pain. The cultural indicators were not found to act as moderators in the analyses that involved pain severity and depressive symptomatology as outcome variables. Nevertheless, this study&apos;s findings are an important initial step in understanding the relationship dynamics among an understudied population with chronic pain and raise many important questions to be pursued in future research. The cultural indicator &lt;italic&gt;simpatia&lt;/italic&gt; was found to moderate the association between perceived solicitous partner responses and relationship satisfaction, indicating that for those valuing &lt;italic&gt;simpatia&lt;/italic&gt;, solicitous responses may be seen to enhance the relational bond between the couple. Furthermore, perceived punishing partner responses were positively associated with pain severity and depressive symptomatology, indicating that these responses are likely seen as negative and may run against that which Mexican American males are expecting from their female partners, even when they are displayed within the context of a relationship that is generally a source of satisfaction. Findings also indicated that Mexican American men who were more acculturated, had been in the U.S. for a greater number of generations, or were lower in &lt;italic&gt;simpatia&lt;/italic&gt;, had worse pain and mood-related outcomes than those who were on the other side of the continuum of these cultural indicators. Despite its limitations, the present study was the first to examine the role of perceived partner responses on pain severity and depressive symptomatology within a cultural framework. Future studies conducted on larger, more diverse samples of Mexican American participants who fall along the entire acculturation spectrum, with the use of face-to-face interviews and behavioral observations, in addition to better paper and pencil measures than those used in the present study, as well as qualitative studies that focus specifically on first generation Mexican Americans, are needed to further examine the role of cultural indicators on the pain experience of married and cohabiting Mexican Americans.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Priestley duality is a categorical duality between bounded distributive lattices and partially ordered topological spaces.  This dissertation relies upon Priestley duality for motivation and for implementation of the results described.  The introduction has a brief treatment of posets, distributive lattices, and Priestley spaces and introduces some results that are important for the rest of the document.The second chapter introduces a new class of bounded distributive lattices which we refer to as scattered lattices. Scattered lattices generalize the concept superatomic Boolean algebras completely and we show that many results for superatomic Boolean algebras are a special case of a result for scattered lattices.  In the process, we develop a new description for this well studied class of Boolean algebras.The third chapter deals with free complete extensions -- an open question for Boolean algebras which Day had settled for superatomic Boolean algebras.  The free complete extension condition is basically a categorical reflection to a category of complete objects.  We show two such properties.  The first extends the results of Markowsky and deals with free completely distributive lattices.  The second is an abstraction of Day&apos;s results to scattered lattices.The fourth and final chapter introduces a duality between a category of meet semilattices and a category of topological spaces endowed with a ternary relationship called betweenness.  We introduce the category of meet semilattices first.  The properties are both natural and interesting and are developed through properties on the convex clopen sets of Priestley spaces.  The category of spaces are called tween spaces and exhibit many of the endearing properties of Priestley spaces.  The duality is shown to be full and many interesting properties of tween spaces and the meet semilattice spaces are explored.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This phenomenological study explored the lived experience of home as it was experienced existentially by Russian Jewish elderly refugees living in a senior/disability apartment complex in Denver, Colorado. Applying the procedure of purposeful sampling, data was collected in a series of in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews from 8 participants, both male and female, aged 70 to 83. All of the participants originated in the region of Ukrainian and Belorussian Poles&apos;e, within 70 km from Chernobyl, Ukraine, and lived there at the time of the nuclear catastrophe, prior to immigration. Data was analyzed using Moustakas&apos; transcendental phenomenology method. The essence of the phenomenon can be understood in terms of (a) the constant, ongoing formation of home: creating, losing, and creating home anew, (b) home as the fundamental place where existential needs are met, and (c) the potential of the home environment to satisfy existential needs, either constraining or promoting their satisfaction. The study revealed home as grounded in the participants&apos; creating, losing, and creating home anew in all domains of home: the natural and built environment, as well as the sociopsychological, sociopolitical, socioeconomic, and sociocultural. These domains served as sources of meaning in addressing the participants&apos; existential needs for belongingness, rootedness, continuity, authenticity, efficacy, self-worth, familiarity, and stability. It was also found that the home environment determined iii the degree of both acceptance and freedom to participate in creation of one&apos;s home. Implications for social work education, research, practice, and policy are suggested.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This qualitative study explored the stories of eight adults who experienced self-forgiveness in psychotherapy. Participants engaged in two semi-structured interviews and discussed issues related to their process of self-forgiveness, the stages of self-forgiveness, and the perceived benefits and consequences of self-forgiveness. In addition, participants disclosed critical moments that they experienced in psychotherapy and how they perceived their therapist to be helpful and supportive of their self-forgiveness journey. Based on phenomenological principles, data collection and analysis indicated that experiencing self-forgiveness greatly impacted the lives of the participants, although it did not seem that there was a uniform process of self-forgiveness that the participants underwent to achieve their results. This study extends the previous research conducted by forgiveness researchers. Implications of this study and suggestions for further research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The interest of this research lies within the realm of development studies by more specifically studying the relationships between social capital and labor market outcomes. The main purpose is to explore the role of social capital in explaining employment outcomes. This research developed an integrated model of social capital and employment outcomes, combining the development literature view of social capital with mechanisms of social capital influence on labor market outcomes as introduced in sociological literature. The development literature approach incorporated in the model foresees different elements of social capital potentially playing a varied role in employment outcomes. It is in this regard that the integrated model of social capital and labor market outcomes was supported by evidence: it pointed to the multifaceted nature of social capital as different aspects of social capital contribute toward explaining employment outcomes of diverse groups.The second part of the model proposed mechanisms on how social capital may influence labor market outcomes relating to the cost of social capital, information flow and homophily. According to the proposed theoretical functioning of these mechanisms, it is expected that disadvantaged groups tend to rely more on social networks in finding jobs and they also tend to rely more on strong ties. This weakness of strong ties explanation, however, fell short in this analysis in explaining the mechanisms of utilizing social capital networks for labor market participation and the differentiated labor market outcomes across groups.Thus, the integrated model of social capital and labor market outcomes helped to demonstrate the complexity of social capital in the sense that it is different aspects of social capital that contribute to explaining employment outcomes. However, the proposed mechanisms of social capital influence on employment in the model were not supported by empirical evidence. It is thus the asset model analysis whereby social capital is one of the assets at the disposal of individuals that provided a more consistent framework for understanding the relationships between social capital and employment outcomes for different population groups.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Speech Perception in Speech Sound Disorder and Reading Disability</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Speech sound disorder (SSD), revealed by spoken articulation difficulties, and reading disability (RD), manifested as a difficulty in decoding written language, are both associated with impaired phoneme awareness (PA). Impairments in speech perception have often been named as the cause for PA difficulties; however few studies have investigated the perception of multiple elements of speech in children with PA impairments.  This study explores how four measures of speech perception, tapping both segmental and suprasegmental processing, are related to phoneme awareness within 10- and 11-year old children labeled as SSD-only (n = 17), RD-only (n = 16), SSD+RD (n = 17), and age-matched Control (n = 16). In accordance with a multi-factorial theory of the relationship between speech perception and phoneme awareness, children in all three clinical groups were impaired on multiple measures of speech perception. All three groups were developmentally delayed in their processing of suprasegmental amplitude envelope cues and in making the attentional weighting shift from the dynamic formant transition cue to the stable fricative noise cue. Only groups of children with RD were developmentally delayed on the syllable similarity task, possibly indicating a closer association between this task and current PA. No groups were impaired on the categorical perception of VOT task. Additional hierarchical regressions predicting PA and vocabulary revealed that amplitude envelope performance was the strongest predictor of both PA and vocabulary but that the fricative noise task also contributed unique variance to vocabulary level and the syllable similarity task contributed unique variance to PA. Finally, the SSD-only group currently did not reveal any PA deficits, despite deficits found in a previous study when these same children were 5-years-old. Analyses exploring the SSD-only group revealed that these children with normalized PA and impaired speech perception have had strong vocabulary and processing speed since age 5, possibly assisting in the development of normal reading and eventual normal PA. In sum, results suggest that impairments in speech perception, both segmental and suprasegmental, may initially impact phonological representations but that with strong protective factors reading may develop normally, allowing PA difficulties to be overcome.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Strings of Relationship and Community: A Dialogue between the Early Years of Bede Griffiths and the Theories of Jean Baker Miller</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Early in her career with the Stone Center, Jean Baker Miller introduced the concepts of being-in-relationship and agency-in-community, yet she (and her colleagues) subsequently did not develop these constructs. Additionally, the relatively small body of literature surrounding the life of Bede Griffiths overlooks almost entirely questions and notions about Griffiths&apos; early psychological development. In presenting a dialogue between Miller&apos;s concepts (informed and developed through Relational-Cultural Theory (RCT) and the work of Clifford Geertz) and the first twenty-seven years of Griffiths&apos; life, this psychobiography develops being-in-relationship and agency-in-community into useful constructs addressing how psychological development occurs within an RCT framework. This study also offers insights into Griffiths&apos; unconscious desires for relationship and community, the cultural elements through which he sought to maintain relationship, his search for an alternative community, and his psychological journey to Benedictine monasticism.This psychobiography illustrates the establishment during infancy and early childhood of being-in-relationship and agency-in-community as pathways of psychological development in Griffiths&apos; life, and it tracks Griffiths&apos; attempts to maintain these pathways by watching him seek out relationship and community with entities through which he could experience the sublimation of his repressed desires and emotions. Through a close investigation of Griffiths&apos; writings on his early years, this study infers that a sense of God underlies each of these entities, and that this sense of God eventually transformed into a search for God, which operated as a symbol through the remainder of Griffiths&apos; life. During his early adulthood, Griffiths endured a period of isolation and despair shortly before entering Prinknash Priory, and this study conceptualizes this struggle as resulting from difficulties in maintaining genuine relationship and community. Finally, this study explores Benedictine monasticism through the lenses of relationship, community, and symbol systems in attempts to illustrate how and why Griffiths chose a monastic adult life.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>TENURE AND PROMOTION DIFFERENTIALS FOR WOMEN FACULTY AND FACULTY OF COLOR AT PUBLIC TWO YEAR COLLEGES IN THE UNITED STATES</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Despite progress toward equal opportunity in the American workplace and an increasing number of people of color and women with PhDs, these populations remain under represented among tenured and high-ranking higher education faculty (National Center for Education Statistics, 2003; Perna, 2001; Perna, 2003).  The persistence of women and people of color within the untenured and lower ranks of higher education faculty supports stereotypes of the academy as patriarchal and geared toward the ideals, life circumstances, and priorities of Caucasian men.For full time, domestic faculty with regular appointments at public, two year colleges, this study attempts to understand the extent to which gender and race/ethnicity are related to tenure status and academic rank after controlling for human capital and structural capital variables.  Data for this study were obtained from the 2004 National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF &apos;04), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).A factor analysis confirmed the viability of the theoretical framework; thus, logistic regression analyses were run to isolate the effects of gender and race/ethnicity on tenure and academic rank after controlling for human capital and institutional structural characteristics.  Though male and Caucasian faculty maintained a decided representational advantage in terms of tenure status, the advantage was eliminated after controlling for differences in human capital investment and structural characteristics.  No significant gender difference in the attainment of the rank of full professor was revealed; however, Caucasian faculty maintained an advantage over faculty of color regarding attainment of the rank of full professor, an advantage that was even more pronounced within centralized community college systems than within the general population of full time faculty in public two year institutions.  This advantage was not eliminated by controlling for differences in human capital investment and structural characteristics.Implications for future research include the measure of social capital, higher education research by CHEA region, further research comparing public, two year institutions to centralized community college systems, and determinations regarding whether Biglan classification should be used as a measure of structural or human capital.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Abjection of Female Sexual Desire in Indian Christianity: A Pastoral Theological Analysis</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In a South Indian Protestant cultural context, the construction of gender, as seen in social practices and Christian theology that communicate abjection, reduces female desire to a problematic condition to which a feminist pastoral theology provides a corrective.India is renowned for its contributions to the erotic imagination, conjuring up images of sensuality and an unapologetic appreciation of the human body. Evidence of the presence of eroticism and sexual desire in Indian culture are seen in the Kamasutra, a centuries old manual of social and sexual interactions, the erotic temple sculptures capturing men and women in the throes of passion, symbols of romantic love as in the Taj Mahal, and art forms including classical Indian dance and music which have as their central theme seduction and surrender to sexual desire.The explicit erotic displays visible throughout the country in architecture and art forms, however, stand in stark contrast to images of the demure, de-eroticized Indian women that are held up as ideals of womanhood in contemporary Indian society. The deep chasm between the artistic celebration of the erotic body and sexual intimacy and the deep-seated negative notions of female sexuality can be explained by the fact that within South Indian cultural contexts female sexuality and desire are acknowledged, but procreation within socially-sanctioned marital relationships is constructed as the primary function of female sexuality, at the expense of erotic desire. Protestant Christianity in South India as shaped by pre-colonial, colonial, and Indian aspirations for a sovereign nation selectively appropriated beliefs and practices that establish virginity and chastity as ideals of womanhood in a manner reminiscent of their Hindu culture prior to conversion.Associating sex with an unpleasant activity devoid of pleasure, in conjunction with practices which communicate the belief that pleasurable sexual intimacy is blasphemous induce shame and guilt ultimately leading to the abjection of erotic desire. As a corrective to existing negative constructs, female sexual desire is defined as that which embraces the erotic and pleasurable aspects of the female body seeking intimacy in relationship with oneself and a desired other. Such a definition privileges the pleasurable aspects of sexual intimacy apart from its procreative function, and establishes the primacy of its expression and experiences as being in the subjectivity of women. Theological reflection on the function of the Church, theology and pastoral ministry is engaged through Fr.Kappen&apos;s liberation theology. Further, Kappen&apos;s concept of the Divine gift-call is applied to the context of female sexual desire constructing the female body including its procreative and pleasurable aspects as a gift affirmed by God. Methodologically, this dissertation is a dialogue between post-colonial, psychoanalytic, and pastoral theological literature.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In our teaching careers,K-12 classroom teachers come to know that the way a given student connects the dots to comprehend a concept, lesson, or subject is not always (and most likely never is)in a straight linear fashion. The connections between the dots are defined as the student&apos;s personalized understanding (tacit knowledge/knowing)of concepts, lessons, and/or subjects. The student most likely did not perceive, process, and/or retain the concept, lesson, or subject in the manner it was taught to her or him. Teachers asking a student to explain how he or she arrived at an answer or knew the answer to a problem was &lt;bold&gt; right, &lt;bold&gt; are often told, &lt;italic&gt; &quot;It just came to me,&quot; &quot;I know it&apos;s right, but I just cannot explainit,&quot; or &quot;I just Know!&quot;&lt;italic&gt; These students do not fit the norms of schooling; this affects how they are seen and how they see themselves. They know there is a disconnection between what they know tacitly, and how thet are expected to explain what they know to prove that they know it. Theoretically this phenomenon is not accounted for in the literature of Epistemology or Curriculum and Instruction. The purpose of the study is to identify the essence of the tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiating process used by forensic artists, to interpretively shed light on its implications as a curricular and instructional model to help students who otherwise would be put unnecessarily at risk because of their tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiating process.In this qualitative interpretative exploratory study I use forensic craniofacial reconstruction as the lens through which I investigated the exhibits of tacit knowledge for its implication for curriculum and instruction. The study recruited volunteer members of ProjectEDAN as the study&apos;s participants. The research methodology combined &lt;italic&gt;Interview as Research &lt;italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Interpretative Biographies that served as case studies of my participants . the collected data served as part of the inductive evidence along with the three foundational premises from the theories of Polanyi,Denzin, and Miller@ Page as the bases for a Grounded Theory of Multistability to account for implications of tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiating  processes in curriculum and instruction.The major findings from the data highlight the participants&apos; philosophical foundational beliefs, the autotelic experiences in conjunction with their preferred method of working , their major epiphany (if any), and their reflections. The participants behaved as they perceive relative to the above categories as agents moving toward their equilibrium in the Complex Adaptive System of the facial reconstruction information processing problem-negotiating process. This is the milieu from where tacit knowledge emerges. The significance of the findings indicate the path for further investigation into tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiation by entertaining a Multistability Theory of Curriculum and Instruction based on the Ideology of &quot;Do No Harm.&quot;</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of adding a participative Goal Setting approach, to an already employed classroom intervention, Aggression Replacement Training (ART).  It was hypothesized that by utilizing a targeted intervention such as ART with the added component of participative goal-setting (PGS), students with emotional behavioral disorders (EBD) would evidence more behavioral and academic gains than if ART was utilized alone.  Additionally, by adding PGS, student&apos;s motivation and commitment to setting personal goals would foster an improved sense of personal control within their school environments resulting in increased responsibility for student actions, both academically and behaviorally.Thirty-five participants from 4 middle schools in an urban school district were randomly assigned to 4 groups, two groups received ART only and two groups received ART + PGS.  Each participant had previously been identified as EBD and was receiving their education in a self-contained classroom setting for more than sixty percent of their day.  Students were asked to complete pre-post self-report behavioral questionnaires on their perceptions of their behaviors and feelings of personal control, as well as, a bi-weekly measure on monitoring their skills learned during ART.  Teachers were asked to complete pre-post rating scales of their impressions of student behaviors in school and to complete daily Behavioral Point Sheets (BPS) on each student.  Students in the PGS condition wrote one weekly academic goal and one behavioral goal with the support of their teacher.The findings of this study indicate all groups progressed in their development and performance of ART skills over time however, the ART + PGS group showed enhanced improvements by achieving higher levels of progression over time (p&gt;.01).  In addition, the students in the ART + PGS group reported feeling more competent in transferring these learned skills to other academic and social settings (p&gt;.01).  ANCOVA results revealed there was a significant increase in cumulative GPA scores (p &gt;.01), as well as a significant decrease in teacher reported conduct problems (p &gt;.05), aggression (p &gt;.05), and in the overall overt disruptive behaviors (p &gt;.05) of each student.  Large effect sizes were found (η2 = .130 to .475).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Suicidality is an increasingly concerning phenomenon for researchers and practitioners alike.  Existing research reflects the emotional impact that suicidal behaviors have on friends, family, and treating clinicians.  As group therapy has been shown to be effective in many treatment settings and as a result has increased in its use, it is expected that more groups will experience members with suicidal behavior; however research is sparse on the impact of a suicidal individual on group therapy.  Much of what is known is related to the impact of suicidal behaviors on individual therapists.  The complexity of groups makes this phenomenon increasingly challenging.  The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the experiences of group leaders when an individual becomes suicidal during the course of group therapy.This study employed a phenomenological design in which nine group leaders from different agencies were interviewed.  They varied in age, gender, ethnicity, experience, work setting, education, and theoretical orientation.  They were interviewed on two separate occasions and were asked about their experiences when a group member became suicidal.  In addition, they were asked about the impact of the experience on the group process, the other group members, and on themselves.The interviews were dissected and clustered into themes in order to determine the essence of the experience.  These interviews revealed that the group members, group leaders, and group process were all impacted.  Specifically, group leaders experienced an increase in fear and anxiety.  The group leaders&apos; experiences were synthesized, and it was found that none of the co-researchers had received training in working with suicidality in group therapy.  In addition, the agencies had no specific selection procedures for their groups, nor did they have policies regarding suicidality and group therapy.  These and other results highlight the implications for both training and practice to address these concerns and help therapists more effective work with suicidality in groups.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>THE IMPACT OF VIRTUAL REALITY-ENHANCED EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ON ADHERENCE TO DAILY STEP GOALS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Adherence to regular exercise is critical for people who are overweight or obese. A multiple baseline design was used to explore the effect of a virtual reality-enhanced exercise treadmill on adherence to daily step count goals. Three sedentary female participants were recruited from a list of graduates of the ColoradoWeigh weight loss program. A goal number of step counts was calculated for each participant by subtracting their average daily step count from 11,000, the daily total recommended by the ColoradoWeigh program. The dependent variable was the percentage of goal step counts achieved on the treadmill. During the baseline phase of the study, the participants exercise on a treadmill three times per week and wore pedometers to record the number of steps they completed during each session. Baseline phase lengths differed across participants, allowing for staggering of the beginning of the intervention phase. The intervention consisted of seven virtual reality scenarios that were natural route recordings of bicycle and/or running pathways. The scenarios, presented on a flat screen monitor mounted above the exercise machine, were generated by software on a desktop PC that provided video and resistance, thereby simulating the recorded trail experience. The intervention phase lasted eight weeks and was followed by a four-week post-intervention phase, during which the participants logged and reported their daily step counts. Results of visual and statistical analyses of the data revealed that the intervention had no effect on the participants&apos; adherence to step count goals. Analysis of questionnaire data indicated that the intervention did not increase the participants&apos; intrinsic motivation or self-efficacy for exercise. The intervention did not produce a measurable sense of presence in the participants. Any noted increases in step counts across the phases were likely due to improvements in physical endurance. Further, the intervention had no effect on the participants&apos; step counts on days when they did not use the treadmill. The intervention did result in increased step counts, weight loss, and a sense of enjoyment. It is possible that, provided certain study limitations were addressed, a more immersive and realistic version of the virtual reality intervention might produce quantifiable, positive effects.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation claims that there is a persistent cultural myth to the democratic scandal, which perpetuates and legitimizes the U.S. government&apos;s ability to regulate itself, which limits the typical sovereign agency of &quot;the people.&quot; Examining the Teapot Dome, Watergate, and Clinton/Lewinsky scandals, the myth begins in a political context of relative prosperity that is shattered by the press&apos; publicity of misconduct. Politicians then engage in partisan rhetoric that depicts the charges as politically inspired attacks. Shocking evidence and/or testimony then reinvigorate the public&apos;s attention, but the heightened attention is lost as the scandal often goes to the courts, where it receives sporadic news coverage and results in little comment by those involved, as well as a lack of full participation by the accused. Finally, the scandal concludes with the confirmation or vindication of wrongdoing or in abdication.As the scandal unfolds, the hero is the accused politician who redeems the political order through mortification (i.e., resignation) or becoming a scapegoat (tried and/or convicted) by the government of which is he a part. The press is an apparent hero in that they seemingly provide symbolic oversight over the government, which, in actuality, provides the reporters with information used in the initial publicity of misconduct. Members of the electorate, who are normally agents in democracy, have
their agency limited in the scandal as the government is able to contend with the accused politician.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study focuses on the work of Zimbabwean novelist Yvonne Vera and how her writing reflects historical and political ideas in an interaction with her reader to communicate said ideas. It also pertains to how her stylistic choices and characterization portray particular ideas about Zimbabwe culturally, socially, and politically to understand better how fiction resides in or promotes a worldview as implicated by language choices and the rhetorical situation. Vera politicizes personal stories of individual characters to convey the history of her country. Individuals in her work reflect broader problems in the country, including the colonial legacy, patriarchy, and a state of war and dissolution. The historical impact of these problems on women in particular draws her focus; themes she writes of include the silencing of women, physical attacks against the female body, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic in her nation--in my parlance, the themes of articulation, fragmentation, and infection. Despite the sometimes disturbing subject matter, her style lulls people with its beauty and orality but at the same time communicates the political reality of contemporary Zimbabwe.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The public health burden of physical inactivity continues to grow in the United States. The costs associated with this burden have surpassed $76 billion, and given the growing prevalence of physical inactivity among the U.S. population these costs are expected to increase even further. As such, identifying the mechanisms by which the social environment impacts physical activity and health may aid researchers and policy makers in developing interventions and programs that promote and sustain physical activity, which in turn may lead to better health. In particular, a greater understanding of the impact of social relationships on physical activity and health may contribute to the effective design of interventions for preventing a wide array of diseases. However, given the importance of the social environment to health behaviors and the transition period from adolescence to adulthood characterized by undergraduate and graduate education, the lack of studies using a random sample of students to understand the relationships between social networks, support, physical activity, and health is surprising. To better understand the mechanisms by which the social environment influences physical activity behavior and health, this study examined the relationships between social networks, perceived social support, physical activity behavior and perceived health among a sample of 938 undergraduate and graduate university students. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was used to measure participant characteristics, perceived health status, physical activity behavior, perceived social support, and social network characteristics. Results suggest that study participants tended to have worse health than national available estimates. Additionally, sequential logistical regression findings indicate that the conceptual model guiding the analysis showed good overall classification of responses with the data suggesting that after controlling for demographic variables (educational level, race and ethnicity, and smoking status); social networks were not directly associated with health, but contributed to the overall predictive value of the model. Additionally, perceived social support and physical activity were directly associated with participants&apos; perceived health status. Implications of study findings for university-based health promotion programs, research, and the social work profession are also presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since the passage of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA) (P.L. 96-272) a case review system has been required for all foster care programs across the United States. Foster care review has been required by federal and state law for more than twenty-five years; however there is little academic literature published related to this subject. The general intent of this study was to define the administrative case review as a social work intervention and further explore if as a social work intervention, it moderates the effect of child welfare case practice and thus improves child welfare outcomes for children in out-of-home care in Colorado.This study can be summarized as an examination of the relationship between the administrative case review intervention, review findings and child welfare outcomes in Colorado. Using a quantitative approach, this study explored if different levels of timely case review moderated the effect of case practice (i.e. appropriate placement, case planning, contacts, services, and visitation), as measured by case review findings, and further examined if different levels of timely case review was a factor related to four child welfare outcomes including: length of stay in out-of-home care, permanency, placement stability, and length of time to reentry into out-of-home care.
 
A naturally occurring correlational research design was used to examine the relationships between several variables and the child welfare outcomes. The major findings show that timely administrative case review and increased levels of review attendance (mother, father, GALs, and foster parents) are predictors of the child welfare outcomes of permanency and length of time in out-of-home care.The results of this study identify that the timeliness of the administrative case review intervention is related to shorter lengths of stay for all children served, and has a more intense effect when caseworker contacts are low and the levels of timely case review are high. Findings from this study show that timely case review has a main effect on a child achieving permanency and the length of time a child spends in out-of-home care. Additionally, the results show that timely care review moderates the underlying casework process related to caseworker contacts, demonstrating that a child&apos;s length of stay differs depending on the level of timely case review. 
This study concludes that the administrative case review intervention in Colorado is a social work intervention that promotes shorter lengths of stay and improves permanency for children in out-of-home care. In essence, the administrative case review process in Colorado is effectively achieving what it was originally created to achieve.Hopefully, the findings of this study will be used as a catalyst to further refine and improve policy, practice, and use of case review as an effective intervention for improving the lives of children in foster care.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Toward a Transcultural Politics: Culture, Solidarity, and Space in Feminist Struggles for Global Justice</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This study examines cultural difference and collective action in the context of transnational feminist struggles for global justice. Through critical discourse analysis and performative ethnographic writing, I analyze the discourse of the Association for Women&apos;s Rights in Development&apos;s (AWID) transnational forum held in Bangkok, Thailand in October 2005. The forum attracts a diverse range of activists, academics, development professionals, and politicians who come together to discuss, strategize and organize for increased gender and global justice. I draw from my experiences in Bangkok and my critical analysis of the forum discourse to achieve two interrelated goals: to theorize the shifting, hybrid, spatial nature of culture in a global collective, and to identify strategies for collective agency, specifically strategies for reshaping globalization. I argue that culture, difference, and diversity, while valued, are undertheorized in contemporary research on globalization. Diversity in global movements is paradoxically celebrated and cultivated while also being glossed over or taken for granted. In order to correct this conceptual blind spot, in this project I analyze the articulations and representations of cultural difference within the public discourse of the AWID forum.My analysis reveals that to resist hegemony, AWID members disavow divisions and instead highlight points of connection. A sense of solidarity is constituted by celebrating and forging mutuality through difference. Transcultural solidarity is discursive, not identity-based, and fundamentally collective. This finding requires a rethinking of communication, not as &quot;uncertainty reduction,&quot; but as connectedness. A significant component to transcultural, global solidarity is the role that space plays. The AWID forum functions as a bridge space between the global and the local. By occupying the paradoxical space of the AWID forum, members model and perform mundane and repeatable resistance to global hegemonic forces. Drawing from these findings, I develop a politics of transculturalism which reframes connections across difference in terms of their political importance, possibility, and utility. To highlight the transcultural dimension of this politics is to conceptualize culture not as bounded and fixed, but rather as profoundly mobile, shifting, intersected and relational. These transcultural connections are both local and global, and must be responsive to the layers of spatiality and power that affect people&apos;s contemporary experiences as women or men, as raced or classed or gendered or otherwise embodied communicators and performers.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Towards a Land Conservation Ethic in Zimbabwe: An Ethical and Religio-Cultural Analysis of Land Conservation  Policies and Practices in Communal Areas.</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In this study I analyze the problem of land degradation in Zimbabwe&apos;s Communal Areas (CAs) from the viewpoint of the Shona of Zimbabwe with the aim to formulate a land conservation ethic that motivates people in CAs to promote ecological stability.  The Shona in CAs are proximate agents as well as victims of environmental degradation.  The imperative to survive in a situation characterized by drastic inequalities in the allocation of land and an exploitative global economic system, forces them to engage in unsustainable land use practices.  Land conservation policies in Zimbabwe marginalize Shona values and norms, especially as they relate to land.  Against this background, the study advances the thesis that the problem of land degradation in CAs is primarily social, involving our right relationship with nature and with each other.  Therefore, technical approaches to the problem must be complemented by an ethic informed by Shona religio-culture whose main components are African Traditional Religions and Cultures and African Christianity.The study employs the hermeneutical circle of liberation theology as a paradigm by which to do ethics.  The paradigm follows the three methodological concepts of liberation theology, especially as Clodovis and Leornado Boff expound it.  These are: the socio-analytical mediation and the historical-analytical mediation; the hermeneutical mediation and the practical mediation.  In this method, the oppressed (the Shona), are the key ethical category for assessing all ethical behavior.  The paradigm begins with the lived experiences of oppressive social situations and proceeds to formulate a system of ethics aimed at changing the oppressive situation faced by the oppressed in CAs.The study concludes that a land conservation ethic that effectively addresses the problem of land degradation in CAs is a liberative ethic that comes out of Shona people&apos;s experience of oppression.  It is an ethic that seeks to remove conditions that degrade the land and dehumanize people in CAs.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>TRANSCENDING CURRICULUM IDEOLOGIES: EDUCATING HUMAN BEINGS WELL</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this dissertation is to consider the role of well-being in schooling.  Recent advances in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and medicine have led to a reexamination of the role of well-being in society.  There is a growing body of educational theory on the subject of well-being in schools that draws on these advances (Cohen, 2006; Noddings, 2003, 2006; Ruyter, 2004; Spring, 2007).  The few serious treatments on the role of well-being in education consider it from a theoretical perspective.  Few if any empirical research studies in the fields of Curriculum or Educational Psychology have been conducted that explore well-being in schools.  This dissertation will use the Science of Well-Being (C. R. Cloninger, 2004), an emerging theory unifying many fields of science, to take a new look at alternative education to explore how schools can attend to the well-being of children and society.  Specifically, this dissertation will investigate Krishnamurti Education using an arts-based qualitative research method: &lt;italic&gt;Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship&lt;italic&gt; (Eisner, 1998).I conducted research for roughly one month each at two Krishnamurti schools: the Oak Grove School in Ojai, California, and Brockwood Park in Hampshire, England.  I made long-term observations of 9 teachers at these two schools.  All told, this dissertation draws from 150 hours of observations and interviews with parents, teachers, administrators, and former students.  By studying these two schools, I answer the following research questions: 1) &lt;italic&gt;How is well-being related to schooling?&lt;italic&gt;  2) &lt;italic&gt;In two schools dedicated to the ideas of well-being and self-awareness, what specific strategies and pedagogies are used to help students cultivate self-awareness and well-being?&lt;italic&gt;  3) &lt;italic&gt;What is the significance of theories and practices aimed at increasing well-being for public schools in general?&lt;italic&gt;In an attempt to compare the educational approaches of the two schools, five underlying principles or dimensions emerged, which both schools share.  These five dimensions are: 1) &lt;italic&gt;Safety, Security, and Trust&lt;italic&gt;, 2) &lt;italic&gt;Order, Structure, and Activity&lt;italic&gt;, 3) &lt;italic&gt;Care, Affection, and Attention, 4) &lt;italic&gt;Intellect, Reasoning, and Meaning&lt;italic&gt;, and 5) &lt;italic&gt;The Sacred, Spirituality, and Religiosity&lt;italic&gt;.  These five dimensions of schooling are essential to consider in the development of well-being.  Krishnamurti schools, by attending to all of these dimensions, seek to reinvigorate communities of learning.  Instead of relying exclusively on techniques, ideology, and methods, they seek to create relationships within a community.The three themes that emerged from this study inform this dimensional framework by helping us to see how well-being can be encouraged in each of these five dimensions.  The three themes of &lt;italic&gt;love, freedom&lt;italic&gt;, and &lt;italic&gt;awareness&lt;italic&gt; emerged from the observations and interviews; they also appear frequently in Krishnamurti&apos;s writings and correspond with research from the Science of Well-Being on the practices that lead to greater well-being and the development of character.  The implications of this research for public education and teacher education are explored.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This qualitative study of the Kempe Therapeutic Preschool (KTP) was a community-based research study that utilized ethnographic methods.  The purpose of the study was to produce an in-depth description of the therapeutic educational methods and practices currently utilized in the milieu through direct, non-participant observation of the child-teacher interactions and semi-structured interviews of the teachers and director.  The goal was to use the description of the physical setting, the nature of the structured and unstructured interactions between the children and the teachers, the influences on the children and staff, and the response of the children to the treatment as a foundation for future research and/or program changes.  This study provides an in-depth description of the child-teacher interactions in the therapeutic educational milieu, which included the environment in which the children and teachers interact, as well as the specific methods and practices used in this setting.  It has shed light on the meanings the teachers get from the work they do and from their interactions with the children.  Ethnographic research methods were used in order to place a microscope on the particular setting to elaborate experience, understanding, and meaning within the context.  The narrative leads to a deepening of understanding of what can be applied more universally in treating maltreated preschoolers, beyond those in a psychiatric day treatment program.  Consistent with the qualitative research methodology, after examining themes and patterns that emerged from the data, the answers to research questions were reached.  The researcher&apos;s interpretation of what happened in the environment fit into three areas:  teacher characteristics and ways of being, specific practices and methods used, and the children&apos;s response to the treatment.  The teachers and staff members subjectively believe that the children treated in the program at the Kempe Therapeutic Preschool &quot;get better.&quot;  Consistency, Compassion, Communication, Behavioral Treatment, Individualized Treatment, and Child Response to Treatment were the major categories of the findings of this study.  The next logical step in this area is to design research that will lead to evidence-based practice for maltreated preschoolers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A conceptual and relational analysis of descriptors, keywords, and abstracts of dissertations, completed between 2001-2006, pertaining to Library and Information Studies (LIS) revealed cultural and disciplinary patterns in LIS research. These patterns were analyzed in an effort to ascertain whether recent assertions by library practitioners that the curricula and research in the U.S. and Canadian universities, which confer the first professional degree for librarians, are divorced from the needs of practice.Rooted in the conceptual anthropological framework developed by Tony Becher and Paul Trowler (2001) in Academic Tribes and Territories, the study examined the culture of LIS, examining disciplinary and faculty factors, in an effort to delineate the field&apos;s current parameters as a field of practice and an academic discipline. The sample was limited to a random sample of those dissertations completed between 2000 and 2006 at North American institutions that both offer doctoral programs in library and information science-related programs and confer the ALA-accredited Master&apos;s degree.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explores the intersection between U.S. graduate teacher education and early career persistence of women K-12 teachers. After briefly addressing the complexities of new teacher attrition, I focused my research toward one specific aspect of this issue, providing rationale for investigating the processes of professional identity construction for women completing U.S. graduate-level initial teacher licensure programs.Two interconnected questions guided the study: How, if at all, do women students of graduate-level initial teacher licensure programs perceive (1) their experiences of professional identity construction in those programs and (2) their beginning career persistence in K-12 teaching? Based on an extensive literature critique, I approached my research from the perspective of social cognitive theory, arguing that early career persistence of women K-12 teachers could be enhanced by preservice co-construction of a sense of self-efficacy as a foundation for women&apos;s professional teaching identities.This study employed qualitative narrative inquiry to discover how women licensure students made meaning of their experiences in co-constructing efficacious professional K-12 teaching identities. I collected the temporally-bound stories of eight women, within the context of two graduate-level licensure programs at a public university. I also gathered impressions of the stories&apos; contextual setting.Conversations were recorded and transcribed. Data collection further included observation field notes and multiple artifacts. Individual participant stories were descriptively represented, and narrative themes woven into a descriptive analysis. Contextualized interpretation then provided answers to the research questions.Among essential findings, participants transcended multiple variations in self-concepts and programmatic experiences to constructively co-author professional K-12 teaching identities anchored in domain-specific efficacy around autonomous classroom instruction. Yet K-12 teaching requires comprehensive personal and collective agency. The efficacious professional identities of these women were thus incomplete, due to lack of efficacy-development experiences targeting career management and contextual and gender-related issues in teaching.Study implications accordingly suggest intentional and systematic methods by which graduate-level initial teacher licensure programs may more fully contribute to the early career persistence of women K-12 teachers. Specifically, this research calls for attention to the needs of female preservice students in co-constructing efficacious teaching identities for a profession that is personally and politically perilous.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>UNMASKING SANCTIONED AUTHORITY: A STUDY OF WORD AND IMAGE IN THE NOVELS OF W.G. SEBALD</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation focuses on the confluence of text and image in the work of the German novelist and critic W.G. Sebald. The relationship between text and image produces a non-narrative structure that represents the weight of trauma and cultural dislocation, even as it ruptures narratives of history and progress, and mystifies &quot;sanctioned authority,&quot; a term synonymous with totalitarianism. Sebald&apos;s project shows how history and subjectivities in the grip of sanctioned authority can be powerfully re-presented outside realistic narratives that document a linear passage of time and a &quot;rational&quot; understanding of the causes and effects of trauma.  What is at stake for Sebald is the need to represent trauma--both personal and shared--as contingent and multiple in its effects, horrifying and specific but dispersed through time and space in its recreation in words and images that form multiple texts within a text.  Nothing is made easier by this, and the physical trauma even becomes a metaphysical trauma.  Yet there is somehow a therapeutic effect.  In order to examine both the possibilities of representation and the subject itself, Sebald incorporates reproduced images (photographs, maps, blueprints, and newspaper clippings, for example) into his text and relies on the resulting intertextuality to mediate and open up meaning in ways that unpack the trauma.  He creates narrators and characters who enact the challenge to represent unavoidable history through writing, memory, and images that construct their identities and memories in opposition to the ethical failures of the totalizing narratives of sanctioned authority.By discussing Sebald&apos;s novels in the order in which they were written, the dissertation presents close readings of the texts. The dissertation is also inter-discursive in that it intersperses commentary on the nature of interpreting Sebald&apos;s work within the context of parallel texts: post-Holocaust cultural critique.  So there is reference to the ideas of Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Jean-François Lyotard, and Hannah Arendt. These theorists intersect with Sebald in their critique of the Enlightenment project, the Holocaust and totalitarianism, as well as in their focus on individual life and its relationship to society and history. Further, the dissertation also uses a post-Freudian interpretation of trauma and repression to discuss the compulsive return of subjects (characters and narrators) and texts (Sebald&apos;s critical work and fiction) to moments of disjunction.  And holding all this together is my view of Sebald&apos;s texts as rhizomatic in structure, willing and able to weave together multiple discourses, which itself plainly owes a debt to the critical theories of Deleuze and Guatarri.Sebald&apos;s work demonstrates that the way to bear witness to trauma and historical rupture is to represent the processes of interpreting a horror that is past but always present, and to enter into these processes from a perspective that must continually examine itself. Thus this dissertation seeks to reveal the reciprocal nature of Sebald&apos;s visual and written texts and the way they establish social and personal trauma as painfully real, even as they are always contingent and open to multiple readings.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study was an attempt to understand the validity of ADHD in an ethnically diverse population.  We analyzed the internal and external validity of the disorder, using a number of different analyses, in African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) samples to determine whether ADHD in AA children was similarly valid to ADHD in CA children. We expected to replicate the typical ethnicity main effects found in the literature, and we did, but to test group differences in ADHD, the most important test of validity for these analyses was the ADHD by ethnicity interaction. Results indicated more main effects than ADHD by ethnicity interactions. On an individual symptom, factor, and subtype level, AA and CA groups were similar.  In addition, the disorder is associated with impairment across a number of domains, such as overall functional impairment, comorbid disorders, academic functioning, and neuropsychological performance, in both ethnic groups. Although the minor differences in internal and external validity should be further explored in future studies, the current research suggests that the disorder is equally valid in AA groups.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Currently in the United States, Black males encounter forces of oppression at micro and macro levels of society that have resulted in severe consequences for the collective demographic. As such, there is a need for scholars to engage in research that positions Black males at the center of inquiry by respectfully creating spaces in which Black males can speak for themselves. To contribute to this scholarly conversation, the author elected to focus on the performance of Black masculinity in the context of a predominantly White professional sports organization. More specifically, the purpose of this dissertation was to critically deconstruct the contemporary National Basketball Association (NBA) and to explore the embodied performance of Black masculinity. To do so, the NBA was positioned as a racialized organization relying upon critical race theory (CRT) to expose how race and racism manifest in the league. Then, CRT and theories of performance were utilized to (re)construct Black masculinity. Understandings of Black masculinity were (re)constructed based upon the narrative insights gleaned from the critical ethnographic interviews of 8 past Black professional basketball players. Together as sons, fathers, grandfathers, spiritual beings, community members, and past athletes, these gentlemen gave voice to their lived experiences as Black men. Six themes emerged from the interview data including: (1) getting to the ABA/NBA, (2) speaking on the current league, (3) reflections on past and present racism in professional basketball, (4) performing progressive Black masculinities, (5) speaking to younger generations, and (6) reflections on the Black community. Working from the identified themes, performative writing is used to explore and represent the lived experiences of being a Black male on and off the basketball court. The overarching conclusions drawn from this study indicate that race and racism do in fact matter in professional basketball. Likewise, new understandings of the performance of progressive Black masculinities are offered as well.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>WHO IS IN CONTROL? PRIVACY BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT BETWEEN ADOLESCENTS WITH INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES AND THEIR PARENTS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Adolescence is not only a time for increased independence and privacy from parents, but also the time when the adolescent with diabetes learns to take complete control of his or her health, setting habits of care that are difficult to change. If turbulence of privacy occurs between the parent and child during adolescence, the transition of diabetes care might not be effective and the teenager could face severe health risks. Communication Privacy Management (CPM) Theory is a theoretical framework that uses the metaphor of boundaries to mark ownership lines of privacy and discusses how rules are developed for regulating boundaries The purpose of the study was to discover, through the use of CPM, how boundary negotiations took place in the parent child relationship when the adolescent had diabetes, differences between parent and child in the preferences for open or closed boundaries, and how privacy boundary negotiation affected the transition of diabetes control from parent to child. Participants in this study were parents and their adolescent children (age 13-17 years old) with insulin dependent diabetes. There was a total of 24 participants in 12 families. 12 parents and 12 teenagers, took part in this study through semi-structured telephone interviews. Two overarching themes emerged in this study. The first major theme that came out was the need of parents to be reassured that their children&apos;s metabolic health was acceptable. The second major theme revealed was the idea that teenagers wanted to be in control of their diabetes information and be the initiators of diabetes related conversations and disclosure with their parents. The supporting themes in this study are directly related to principles of Communication Privacy Management theory. For example, themes emerged across families that related to boundary coordination operations, privacy rule foundations, and boundary turbulence. These supporting themes of privacy management practices are correlated with the two major themes of parents needing to know their children&apos;s health was acceptable, and teenagers wanting to control diabetes conversations. When the parent and teen discuss their expectations of what should be disclosed and what can remain private, and both parties follow their established plan, the teenager can feel control over his or her personal information and the parent can feel confident that their child is safe. Since compliance to diabetes treatment is affected by communication with parents, and severe health complications can result from boundary turbulence, it is necessary to examine how parents and teenagers can successfully negotiate boundaries of privacy in order to maintain the health of the adolescent. The proper management of privacy boundaries in the transition of diabetes care from parent to child have immediate and often life altering consequences. This study is a pivotal first step in exploring successful strategies for privacy management and transitioning diabetes care.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Mary Patricia MaddenTitle: Women Preparing for Men&apos;s Occupations: A PhenomenologyAdvisors: Edith W. King, Ed.D. and Franklin A. Tuitt, Ph.D.Degree Date: June 2008ABSTRACTWomen Preparing for Men&apos;s Occupations: A Phenomenology is an in-depth investigation into the phenomenon of learning among seven articulate and mature adult women enrolled in male-dominated occupational programs located at a suburban community college in the western United States. The participants of this phenomenological study were a purposeful homogeneous sample of articulate Caucasian women over the age of 25 enrolled in a community college&apos;s male-dominated occupational programs. Their voices were captured in three intensive interviews. The interviews of three male faculty members involved in male-dominated programs and observations conducted in two classrooms of such programs served to triangulate and validate the data gathered from the women. Four central themes emerged from the data gathered: Maturity, Connected Knowledge, Empowerment, and Absence of Solo Status.Most of the women in this study confronted the silences that oppressed them in the workforce and resigned their positions as they became aware of what was happening to them. They returned to familiar, more comforting territory--school--in an effort to regain or find their voices. The study&apos;s results led to recommendations regarding women&apos;s learning in male-dominated occupational programs. The first of these is the importance of recognizing all virtues, skills, and experiences that mature women offer an occupational program and its other students: leadership skills, empathy, and invaluable life and learning experiences. Second, learning is enhanced if the students areiiempowered: they should be encouraged, valued, and all their voices heard in a climate that fosters respect. Acknowledging the power inherent in the teaching rôle, feminists seek ways to empower students in the educational process. Third, programs that wish to enhance women&apos;s learning should commit to recognize and accommodate multiple learning styles, as well as respect the different contexts of students&apos; lives. This feminist pedagogical approach lends itself well to the teaching of adult women and also benefits male students. Such programs would integrate cognitions, feelings, and experiences and teachers would engage with students in a mutual learning process. Knowledge is shared by all members of the class so the outcome is that there are actually x instructors in the class, including the teacher and every one of the students, all learning from one another.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Increasingly, colleges and universities in the United States are adapting toward amodel of behavior that incorporates issues of sustainability. This adaptation inuniversities and in society has implications on the organizational and nation-statelevel, the very core of which may serve to reshape the social contract between thetwo. In addition to supplying a strong counter-hegemonic argument that alters thecompetitive economic agenda-setting paradigm, this study serves as a tripartitecomparative case study analysis of university adaptation toward socialsustainability. By employing a social capital lens to understanding socialsustainability in higher education, this study seeks to examine the relationshipbetween higher education, sustainability, and the nation-state.The conceptualframework of this analysis will draw on Putnam&apos;s concept of social capital, in theeffort to understand the relationship between higher education, sustainability, andsocial capital as well as what a sustainability paradigm could mean in terms of a&quot;new&quot; social contract.The methodology of this study is exploratory and aimed at understandinguniversity adaptation in three ways: first, elements of organization andadministration aimed at advancing sustainability; second, teaching and researchefforts that have been established within a sustainability frame; and third,community and outreach efforts that examines the role of the university in itslocal environment as well as the work toward public service. The specificmethodology employed can be categorized as comparative case study (Yin, 2003).To validate findings, data is triangulated via a between-methods design andcollected through: qualitative survey, contextual content analysis, andcomparative discourse analysis respectively (Jaeger, 1988).  The result iseffectively a 3 x 3 mixed methods design so that each individual case studyemploys each of the three methodologies in order to provide a rich description ofthe social sustainability phenomena and offer data for comparative discourseanalysis.Findings reveal three distinct strands amongst the case studies in the analysisof sustainability discourse. Results show the importance of the role of,organizational context, personal approach of the chief sustainability agent, andorganizational saga in contributing to adaptation. In this way, sustainabilityapproaches and the priority and university adaptation differed. These threeapproaches can be described as: an energy/operations/facilities perspective, aresearch and academic-focused perspective, and a humanistic-grassrootsapproach.</dc:description>
