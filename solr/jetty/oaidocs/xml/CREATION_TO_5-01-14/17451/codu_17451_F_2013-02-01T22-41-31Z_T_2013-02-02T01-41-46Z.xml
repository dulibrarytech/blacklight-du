  <dc:description>Bishop James O. Mote (1922-2006) grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana, and was a Boy Scout, achieving Eagle status. He served as a chaplain&apos;s assistant in the Army during World War II, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and was awarded a Bronze Star. He graduated from Canterbury College in Danville, Indiana in 1950 and from Nashotah House Seminary in Nashotah, Wisc. in 1951. He moved to Denver, Coloorado in 1951 and was ordained as an Episcopal priest in 1952. He joined St. Mary&apos;s Church at its present location at 2290 S.

  <dc:description>Bishop James Mote shares the history of St. Mary&apos;s Anglican Catholic Church, which moved to the University Park area of Denver, Colorado in the 1930s. St. Mary&apos;s Church withdrew from the Episcopal Church on November 28, 1976 under his direction and joined other parishes in the Diocese of the Holy Trinity, which later became known as the Anglican Catholic Church. Bishop Mote also comments on the expansion of Denver&apos;s city limits to the south and to the east since his arrival in 1951, and notes that the University Park neighborhood is now one of the more central locations in the metropolitan area.</dc:description>

Stratton discuss changes in the University Park neighborhood since moving there in 1948, including the growth of the University of Denver and the impact of busing on neighborhood schools. Thomas Stratton also recounts an incident that took place on October 12, 1958, during the time that he was Scoutmaster for Troop 5 in 1960-1962. Following a hike near Lake Isabelle, Colorado, a member of the troop named Dick Evans fell into a ravine, breaking a leg and his back. Members of Stratton&apos;s Boy Scout troop used their training to assist in Evans&apos; rescue. A report of the incident was published in Helen Orlob&apos;s book, Mountain Rescues. Stratton names many members of the troop from that time and some of their current occupations.</dc:description>
