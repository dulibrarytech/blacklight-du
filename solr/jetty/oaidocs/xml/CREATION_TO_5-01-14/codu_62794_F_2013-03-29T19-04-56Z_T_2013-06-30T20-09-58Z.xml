  <dc:description>Early life stress is known to have an enduring impact on individuals’ health
trajectories, however, some show greater resiliency to early life stress than others. The
exploration of candidate genes and gene-environment interactions may be one promising
window on risk versus resilience trajectories. However, prior work involving three
polymorphisms (COMT Val158Met, MAOA-LPR, and 5-HTTLPR) has yielded well
publicized but inconsistently replicated associations with mental health. Part of this
inconsistency may be due to the limited exploration of mechanistic explanations for how
these gene-environment interactions lead to variations in health. Thus, this dissertation
examines gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in predicting basal cortisol at age
eight (assayed from a single blood sample). Data for this project comes from 813 families
participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Early environmental risk is characterized by three well-documented factors (maternal
depression, maternal stress exposure, and child stress exposure) compiled across the
developmentally salient 0-6 year age range. Contrary to expectation, genetic risk was not
related to children’s basal cortisol in middle childhood, and neither were the tested geneenvironment
interactions. Most measures of environmental risk were also unrelated to
children’s cortisol, however maternal stress exposure when the child was 48-61 months
old was related to higher basal cortisol. Analyses and discussion describe patterns of environmental risk exposure across early childhood in an effort to better characterize risk
trajectories in this sample. Although the current findings do not support HPA axis
dysregulation as a mechanism by which gene-environment interactions impact health,
methodological limitations likely contributed to these null findings. Future studies should
continue to explore such mechanistic explanations in order to create effective
interventions for children at high risk for stress related disease.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This manuscript is an effort to determine the world and how we are to each other. It is also an effort to come into meaning. How imagination is part of that. The escape here has to do with the inability to make things mean—it feels like if I try hard enough there can be a resolution via the imagination. But sometimes when we make things they overcome us. It’s difficult to know the appropriate boundary for imagination—at what point it moves from an attempt to decipher the world into a construction of the reality of the world. I can’t ever tell the difference but I continue to try. Some of what went into this manuscript has is the thinking about neuroscience (neurotheology). My interest in perceptions of reality and what can be obtained from a negotiation of those perceptions leads itself easily into research of the brain: What information is available to us though the technological investigation of brain and what can be determined from research regarding how consciousness is discussed physiologically. Much of the current research in the neuroscience community is occupied with the placement and location of consciousness and self. My own interest within these considerations is centered in the nature of self, place and imagination, and how the correspondence between these given fields of activity allow us to make decisions about what we understand as the world and ultimately how we determine it.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>P. sphinx teen is a novel and creative dissertation that can be classified as 
a descent narrative, or katabasis, employing various literary forms–––poems, short prose, essays, 
journal entries, interviews, and illustrations –––to tell one story: the death, from pneumonia, of 
my mother’s 15-year-old sister. Within the narrative, suggestions of origins are made as a way to 
affix the idea of a descent through generations and time. However, those origins are quickly set 
aside allowing the story to branch like a tree–––itself the shape of a simultaneous katabatic and 
anabatic narrative.
The originating story took place in Detroit, Michigan between 1935 and 1939, and is framed by others: Sigmund Freud’s collection of antiquities and its escape from Vienna in late 1938; the making of Charlotte Salomon’s opus Life? or Theatre?; Anais Nin’s simultaneous marriages; Walter Benjamin’s radio program called Enlightenment for Children. Motifs and characters are interchangeable passes for voices both distinct and indistinct. The author, at times, takes the form of an “I” lifting the life of her lineage to view and, with the suspicion of reincarnation, changing place with the main character, Patricia, who is, simultaneously, one and many. In researching the family story in relationship to historical events and figures associated with 
those events, I discovered an irregularity in record keeping that lead me to question whether my 
aunt had, in fact, died from pneumonia or something less natural.  Because the pertinent family 
members were dead, I turned, first, to a medical chart that my grandmother kept as she tended to 
her sick daughter constructing a series of horary astrological charts that were then interpreted by 
four paranormal industrialists with astonishing results.
P. sphinx teen attempts to manifest the lawless nature of grief as a thumbing of one’s nose at 
those who would have it otherwise or who would make of mourning something compact and manageable. 
It is a book of many voices, ghost-driven, and made equally uncanny by human ineptitude, 
wickedness, and grace.

  <dc:description>My dissertation is entitled “My Education.” It is a poetic meditation on the nature
of knowledge. The manuscript is a triptych, each section of which corresponds to a
common source of knowledge.
The first chapter is a collection of poems entitled As Seen On TV. The poems
borrow conceptual metaphors and visual gestures from television programs in order to
investigate the values that produced them and norms that are produced by them. The
poems are concerned with mimesis: the troubled relationship between art and life.
Organized as a day spent in front the television, the book opens with the morning news,
and ends with late night reruns and static. These poems are about the passage of time, the
female body, and the violence of its rapid obsolescence.
The second chapter, “Boy Friends,” is an alphabetical primer on romance. The
alphabet contains the units of literacy, of knowledge. It is an organizational method. The
alphabet book is a didactic form; it teaches the order of things. In this work, the speaker
lists the men in her life alphabetically, describing her affairs and thwarted love interests,
beginning with Adam and ending with Zachary. The twenty-six lineated poems are
followed by a prose addendum entitled &quot;Roll Call,&quot; in which the speaker tries to list every
boy she ever met and explain what has become of him since she knew him. Many of the
names from “Boy Friends” recur here, and a sense of narrative develops and acts as a
bridge into the final chapter.
The third section, “Confessional Poetry,” is a collection of prose essays modeled
after the Roman Catholic Sacrament of Penance. In this work, I confess a sin to
correspond to each on the Ten Commandments. This numeric organization (1-10) mirrors
the alphabetical organization (A-Z) of “Boyfriends.” This is a work of spiritual
accounting. In it, I tally the wrongs I have done to see how it all adds up. Unfortunately I
am not very good at math. I do not know the final answer. I do know that each of these
stories is an act of contrition.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the last twenty years, researchers, theorists, and clinicians have begun to identify the personal toll on clinicians who work with traumatized clients. Mental health professionals may experience disruptions in their cognitive schema due to their clinical experiences. Clinicians may also struggle with depression, cynicism, alienation from friends and colleagues and an array of psychological and physical symptoms. While researchers have begun to explore how vicarious trauma manifests with clinical staff, there remains a need to identify interventions that are effective in mitigating vicarious trauma, burnout, and intent to leave.
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to investigate the relationship between levels of debriefing interventions and vicarious trauma, burnout, and intent to leave. To that end, a convergent parallel mixed methods design was used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data. The convergent parallel design is a triangulation design where data were collected concurrently using quantitative and qualitative methods. The results of this study addressed whether the debrief intervention is a viable intervention associated with rates of vicarious trauma, intent to leave, and burnout for mental health clinicians who work with children and adolescents with histories of trauma.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>THE WEEK is a collection of short stories. These stories engage the
politicized (if not overly political) question of what it means to be human and to be in
relation to other humans in the world. Some of the stories are quite compressed; I
attempt to create effects in these pieces through subtraction, ellipsis, parataxis, and
surprise. Other stories are more sustained, producing voices that address the reader
directly or voices that follow the involutions of a thought, dwelling on minute details
of consciousness; these pieces play with conventional short story elements (character,
plot, rising action, falling action, etc.), although they often “fizzle” or turn sharply to
unsettle reader expectation. I have found that it is very difficult to be human. That
being human is a problem is both the premise and the conclusion of this book.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Drawing on Charles Taylor’s historical analysis in A Secular Age, this dissertation
reveals connections between the process of Euro-Western secularization and its roots in
the universalizing project of Christianity. This work asserts that religion, a term often
identified with Christianity, developed in conjunction with secularization and concludes
that these theoretical constructs influenced international legal principles which
marginalized indigenous cultures that did not conform to its tenets. Not only did
Christianity and the secular arise from the same roots, but both were shaped by
colonialism.This paper provides a detailed overview of the development of international
law as a colonial project that combined theological and secular interpretations of natural
law and the law of nations creating a vehicle for land acquisition and resource extraction
by examining the writings of Francisco de Vitoria, Hugo Grotius and John Locke. In
order to trace the effects of flows of power from religious authority to state authority, this
paper examines the views of Michel Foucault and Talal Asad on power, agency, identity
and freedom through the lens of religion and the secular. This project focuses on the
Native American experience to demonstrate the interface between Christian missionizing,
the imposition of discipline and civilization and the current American legal system that
asserts a separation of church and state.</dc:description>
