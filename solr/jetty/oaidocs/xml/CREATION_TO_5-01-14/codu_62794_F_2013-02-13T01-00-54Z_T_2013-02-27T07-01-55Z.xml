  <dc:description>Improving student achievement in mathematics in secondary schools remains a priority for public education in our country.  With continued federal and state mandates to improve overall student achievement in mathematics, as well as to close the achievement gap, many school districts have sought programs, such as Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), to assist in improving student performance.  The mission of AVID is to improve the academic achievement of students who are often in the &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;average&quot; and who are typically minorities and are economically disadvantaged.  AVID seeks to support these students by providing them with the strategies that successful students often use, including honing their understanding of writing, inquiry, collaboration, and reading, and developing techniques to improve their organization and critical thinking skills, so they stand a greater chance of entrance into a four-year college or university upon graduation from high school.The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to examine the impact of the AVID program on seventh and eighth grade student achievement in mathematics as measured by the Colorado State Assessment Program (CSAP).  This study, conducted in a middle class suburban middle school of a large school district, compared matched pairs of AVID elective students, AVID team students, and non-AVID students from their 2008 overall CSAP results in mathematics and in the sub-content areas of number sense and geometry with their 2009 overall CSAP results in mathematics and in the sub-content areas of number sense and geometry.The results of this study were mixed.  Students who participated in the AVID elective class showed statistically significant improvement in their mathematical achievement as measured by CSAP; however, no significance was found when comparing student achievement of AVID elective students with AVID team students or non-AVID students.  The AVID program, therefore, may have an overall positive impact on student achievement for those students who are able to participate in classes with AVID trained teachers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With over 12 million children enrolled in early care and education programming across the U.S., families with children under the age of 5 years old are dependent on these programs. Although highly important, little regulation exists regarding qualifications necessary for individuals to work in these programs. Consequently, individuals in the field bring a plethora of professional development experiences, skills, and competencies. This variance is partly a result of the uncertainty surrounding what should be required. Major information about the impact training and education have on these programs is missing from quantitative research, including capturing content and quantity, accurate measurement of professional development, and clear and consistent definition and categorization of training and education across studies.To contribute to the advancement of accurately describing and understanding effective teachers&apos; professional development experiences in terms of content, quantity, intensity, and duration, a descriptive-comparative design was used to explore how the professional development experiences of teachers in 10 good quality early care and education classrooms (as measured by the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised [ECERS-R]) differed from the professional development experiences of teachers in 10 poor quality classrooms serving children ages 2Â½ to 5 years old. Well-defined and recommended categorizations of training, education, and documentation of staff qualifications were used. Other factors that might influence instructional quality, such as program, classroom, and support staff characteristics, were examined as well. Between-group differences of 30% or more were interpreted as interesting.Numerous between-group differences emerged regarding teacher education, training, and credentials. Among these findings, teachers in the good quality cohort were more likely to have completed course content specific to early care and education, including specific combinations of coursework in conjunction with supervised practical experience. The intensity and duration of teachers&apos; exposure to course content was also greater in this cohort. Furthermore, in describing differences, new categories and definitions emerged, including piecemeal and comprehensive education, piecemeal and comprehensive training, content clustering, solo teaching, and hierarchical structuring of staff. These findings can be used as emerging foundations for larger scale research.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using grounded theory methodology, this research explored, described and theorized about the ways youth, specifically homeless youth; make sense of their bodies within the context of living environments.  It describes the relationship between body, space, and context for homeless youth in order to inform treatment options for this population. The importance of context, setting, and participant frame of reference was stressed, because embodiment is contextually and culturally influenced. The research addressed the questions: What is the process of becoming consciously embodied for homeless youth who have experienced multiple traumas? Do homeless youth who have experienced multiple traumas perceive a role for yoga therapy in the process of becoming consciously embodied?  Interviews were conducted with 16 homeless youth, 2 agency administrators, and 1 yoga teacher who acknowledged that she was homeless in her youth. Interviews followed a general interview guide designed to elicit responses concerning trauma, homelessness, embodiment, and well-being. The research resulted in the development of a theoretical conceptualization of embodiment and trauma in homeless youth.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Multiparty voice communication, where multiple people can communicate in a group, is an important component of networked virtual environments (NVEs), especially in many types of online games. While most research has been conducted on one-to-one communication, we focus on group communication. In this dissertation, we present the first measurement study on the characteristics of multiparty voice communications and develop a model of the talking and silence periods observed during multiparty communication. Over a total of 5 months, we measured over 11,000 sessions on an active multi-party voice communication server to quantify the characteristics of communication generated by game players, including group sizes, packet distributions, user and session frequencies, and speaking (and silence) durations. Further, we develop a model for multiparty voice communication that can be used for future research, simulation, network engineering, and game development work. Next, we propose a peer-to-peer protocol that uses Gabriel graphs, a subgraph of Delaunay-triangulations, to provide scalable multiparty voice communication. In addition, our protocol uses positional information so that voice data can be accurately modeled to listeners to increase the immersiveness of their experience. Our simulations show that the algorithms scale well even in densely populated areas, while prioritizing the sending of voice packets to the closest listeners of a speaker rst, thus behaving as users expect. We also develop a security framework that prevents common attacks. Finally, we implement our protocol and put it through exhaustive validation, where we use the model that we generated using our multiparty voice communication model.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Pastoral Theology of Congregational Care and Leadership:  Nurturing Emergence</dc:title>

  <dc:description>As with all bodies, congregational bodies experience challenges to their health, well-being, and ability to function as they desire.  Problems in faith communities range from severe, intractable conflict to lethargy and decline, with far-ranging effects.  The practice of offering pastoral care to individuals experiencing difficulties is rooted deeply in the Judeo-Christian tradition.  There is, however, no explicit tradition of pastoral care for corporate congregational bodies experiencing difficulties.  This dissertation draws on Bowen Family Systems Theory and its application by Edwin Friedman to congregations and leadership, in conjunction with aspects of process theology, to develop a pastoral theology of congregational care and leadership to guide care of suffering congregations.The cornerstone concept of Bowen Family Systems Theory, differentiation of self (a capacity to maintain self in relationship), is brought together with Whitehead&apos;s understanding of the teleology of the universe as maximizing beauty (the harmony of contrasts) to name differentiation as a process by which the Divine lures creation toward beauty and the emergence of new phenomena.  A positive response to the lure of the Divine toward beauty and emergence, or serendipitous surprise, is posited as a norm for the life of a Christian congregation.  Care and leadership of congregations involve nurturing movement toward beauty and emergence through the presence and being of a clergy caregiver/leader working on differentiation of self.  This promotes the capacity of the congregation to be theotokos (God-bearer), embodying the presence of God&apos;s differentiating, life-seeking, graceful, and creative relationship with the universe.Pastoral theology begins with situations of human suffering and brings together cognate and theological resources to deepen understandings and shape care to respond to the suffering.  Traditionally, academic pastoral theology addresses the difficulties of individuals and families, as well larger societal issues that contribute to difficulties.  In conceptualizing a congregation as a whole in need of care, and attending to its healing and care from the perspective of pastoral theology, this work offers an extension of the discipline of pastoral theology into congregational care.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The national crisis of the academic achievement gap is one of the most impactful phenomena for the nations&apos; public schools. This study used a phenomenological qualitative research design to capture the essence and perceptions of building principals&apos; experiences related to principles of anti-racist leadership training. The researcher interviewed ten principals who had provided numerous questions in an interview format, to gain insight into the attitudes, beliefs, and leadership practices as they relate to the eradication of the achievement gap at their respective sites. The researcher conducted ten, in-depth, interviews with specific questions related to the achievement gap. All of the principals&apos; are employed in the Meadow Grove School District boundary area in an affluent residential suburb outside of southeast Denver, Colorado. Each Principal received an initial ninety-minute interview and a follow-up phone call. The ten identified principals&apos; were from varied racial and cultural backgrounds.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the nature and meaning of racial and ethnic identity as described by adult Asian adoptees who were transracially and internationally adopted. Particular focus of the study examined the racialization experiences and the relationships between racial and ethnic identity and socialization, and identified key influences on self-perception.  The intent of this study was to gain insight into how this particular social group negotiated racial issues during different stages of development, while maintaining a sense of self. This study&apos;s approach took a narrative form, as participants described the essence of their experience contributing to their racial and ethnic identity and self-perception and how meaning was created in the process of identity development in relation to their social environment. This study included 8 participants, age 25-46, from diverse geographic locations, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, gender, marital status, age at adoption, and country of birth. The phenomenological approach was used to ascertain the meaning, structure, and the lived experience of this group by inquiring into the truth and reality of their experience, and examined the nature of this knowledge. It was discovered that adult adoptees conceptualized and negotiated racial and ethnic identity, perceptions of self, essential feelings, and finally, self-acceptance as a result of family practices and social environment, in addition to their racialization and the adoption experience.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>For many families child care is a necessity for economic self sufficiency, as without it caretakers cannot enter and stay in the workforce.  However, for many low-income families childcare expenses are so high that they often cannot afford it without government support.  The focus of this study was to understand how families make decisions about childcare in relation to government support.  Of specific interest are low-income families who receive the government supported child care subsidy in Colorado known as the Colorado Child Care Assistance Program (CCCAP).CCCAP is a part of work support benefits that are provided by the State to support families to move to self-sufficiency through the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act enacted in 1996.   Problematic however, is that work supports are incrementally lost as a family&apos;s income increases but often before sufficient income can be sustained to replace that support.  This phenomenon, termed the &quot;cliff effect&quot;, was aptly named as losing benefits can be like falling off a cliff.A mixed-methods study was conducted in four Colorado counties.  In Phase I, 332 families who, at the time of the study, were currently or in the past two years on CCCAP, participated in a survey distributed at childcare facilities.  In Phase II, 21 one-on-one interviews were conducted with families who had experienced the cliff effect.  In addition, meetings with a group of low-income families, childcare providers, and other local experts were conducted to inform both the study design and findings.The study revealed that families use a combination of resources to make up their income package which they need to manage everyday survival, including government benefits, wages, and social supports.  While the cliff effect is a significant barrier to moving from government supports to self sufficiency, there are multiple other circumstances that add to the very real reasons that women have to carefully strategize to survive, consistently on the edge of losing work support benefits.  The most helpful things for families in strategizing around CCCAP were a flexible job and solid social supports.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The main purpose of this study is to explore the association between social capital and recovery from mental illness in community-based rehabilitation services within the Taiwanese social and cultural context.  This study employed a cross-sectional survey design using a convenience sample of 310 mental health consumers who were members in community mental health agencies (the rehabilitation centers or the half-way houses) in Taiwan and 26 practitioners who were familiar with these participated consumers.  A series of hierarchical multiple-regression models were used to identify whether access to social capital has an independent effect on the perceptions of recovery.  As expected, access to social capital dimensions, especially mobilization of personal social network, had independent effects on subjective recovery but not on objective recovery.  Moreover, access to social capital was a partial mediator of the relationship between social functioning and subjective recovery.  Next, the levels of access to social capital among consumers in the half-way houses were not different from those in the community rehabilitation centers.  In general, consumers in the community rehabilitation center had higher immediate family support levels than those in the half-way house.  However, consumers in the half-way house had higher friend support levels than those in the community rehabilitation center.  These findings suggest that consumers must have willingness and power to mobilize their own social networks and relations when needed, besides having opportunities of access to social resources.  The study implies that mental health practitioners should design interventions to enable consumers to increase reciprocal social relations with others and to facilitate their levels of access to social capital, which may lead to recovery of consumers.  Future study and limitations are also discussed in the study.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Acculturation of Russian Refugee Adolescents: the Life Domain of Peer Relationships</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative study was to uncover the meaning of acculturation as experienced by the Russian refugee adolescents in the domain of peer relationships.  This qualitative study implemented a purposeful sampling strategy. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 refugee adolescents from Russia (3 ethnic Russians and 9 Meskhetian Turks), male and female, aged 15-18, who resided in Denver, Colorado. Applying Moustakas&apos;s (1994) phenomenology method of analysis, 8 main themes emerged. The essence of the phenomenon can be described in terms of the refugee adolescents&apos; need for self-worth and belongingness. Belongingness is understood as identification with and acceptance by peers of the culture of origin and host culture in a culture-contact situation upon immigration. It was found that exclusion by peers pushed refugee adolescents to search for restoration of dignity, acceptance, and identification with other culture(s) available to them. The findings revealed important factors moderating acculturation to the American culture in the peer relationships domain: refugee adolescents&apos; perception of pre-migration experience, a limited pool of potential partners, deprivation of the adult status,  perceived discrepancy in the level of maturity between themselves and their American peers, cultural discrepancies in understanding friendship and ways of courtship, English languagecompetence/use/preference, and perceived discrimination/negative treatment by part of the American peers from the dominant culture. In particular, negative treatment received from members of the dominant American culture was identified as a factor moderating acculturation to non-dominant American cultures in the peer relationships domain, and along with other factors, served as a basis for identification of the participants with the heterogeneous group of immigrant/minority youth from different countries who perceived similar negative treatment from their American counterparts. Perceived negative treatment was found to be a powerful risk factor, creating conditions for reactive identity formation towards the American culture, idealization of an oppositional culture, and self-radicalization. Implications for social work education, research, and practice, as well as future research opportunities are suggested.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>An ERP Investigation of Hand-Based Bias on Visual Attention</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Recent behavioral studies have investigated the importance of hand and arm position in visual attentional processes. Reed et al. (2006) found facilitated (faster) detection for targets that appear in the space near the hand, relative to targets appearing on the opposite side of a monitor display.  The current study aimed to explore the potential bottom-up and top-down neural sources underlying this hand-bias effect on attention with ERP. Using a standard, non-predictive visual cuing paradigm, we examined early (N1, P1) and later (P3) ERP components in response target presentations in three conditions: with the non-responding hand resting on the table (Resting), with the hand held up near the screen and target location (Up), and with the hand held up but away from the screen (Away). An effect of hand-position was found for the P3 in a central electrode group, in which validity effects that were present in the Resting and Away conditions, were not present in the Up condition. This result suggests that top-down sources of attentional bias from positioning a hand near the screen can alter the occurrence of validity effects in this ERP component. However, significant effects were not found in the earlier P1 and N1 components, nor did the behavioral results completely replicate the original findings of Reed et al. (2006). The limited findings from these other aspects of the study may be explained by a number of limitations discussed in the paper.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>AN EXAMINATION OF CAREGIVING DYADS: COMMUNITY DWELLING CHRONICALLY ILL OLDER ADULTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Increases in life expectancy among older adults raise important concerns about the availability of resources for an aging population living with chronic and debilitating illnesses.  Living longer is complicated by the fact that many elders prefer to reside in their homes until medical or other conditions require an alternative living arrangement.  The strong desire to remain at home expressed by older persons in the United States has in turn created an increased demand on informal caregiving.  Consequently, adult children often bear the burden of providing care to their aging parents.  In view of this demand it is critical that research be conducted to identify the conditions that may threaten the stability of long-term caregiving arrangements.  The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of interpersonal dynamics between caregivers and care-receivers during the care process.  Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between role engagement and quality of commitment among caregivers and care-receivers and to assess how these two processes impact the psychological well-being of such dyads.  A sample of caregiver and care-receiver dyads as well as additional caregivers were identified through Colorado agencies that administer home and community-based Medicaid programs and used to evaluate relationships between dyad members.  Higher caregiver personal commitment to their care-receiver was related to care-receivers&apos; experience of dyad strain.  Caregiver perception of care-receiver competence had a negative relationship with care-receiver depression.  Higher personal commitment in care-receivers was positively related to caregiver autonomy.  Higher care-receiver relational coping was related to lower levels of caregiver dyad strain and depression.  Personal commitment and perceived role competence of the care-receiver were significantly related to depression in caregivers.  Like care-receivers, caregivers with higher levels of personal commitment also had lower levels of depression and lower dyad strain, higher positive interaction, and higher perception of care-receiver competence.  Caregiver personal commitment and perceived role competence of care-receivers were significantly associated with depression in caregivers.  Results indicate that personal and moral commitment may be important predictors of psychological well-being.  Study findings that inform existing practice and policy strategies for older adults and their caregivers are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>To be successfully intelligent in the 21st century, students must be able to think well in at least three ways: creatively, critically, and practically, with complexity and wisdom. The purpose of this research was to explore the differences in middle school students&apos; quality of thinking in arts classrooms that are designed to be learner centered to a greater or lesser degree. Classroom environments which foster balanced intelligence in analytical, creative, and practical ways toward depth of understanding were the focus of this study. A better understanding of the impact of learner-centered environments on students&apos; perceptions of their learning and understanding in these classrooms was also sought. This research study supported theory in the area of balanced intelligence, toward the realization of students&apos; increased capacity to learn and achieve.Results of this mixed model comparative study indicated that classrooms designed to be more learner-centered (utilizing inquiry, connection-making, and self-direction to a greater degree) had a positive effect on students&apos; overall quality of thinking as demonstrated in a balanced way. Results also indicated that more learner-centered classrooms also had a positive effect on students&apos; self-beliefs regarding their intelligence and understanding in the context of visual art.This study suggests that infusion of best practice research toward the development of balanced thinking and overall cognitive development in the arts is beneficial to students and provided insight into the ways in which personal belief systems about capabilities and intelligence drive motivation, which may in turn drive learning goals and overall achievement. The mixed model exploratory design led to an emerging theory regarding a systems approach to the development quality thinking, as driven by the learning and thinking culture, belief systems, and dynamic classroom environments.This study provides insight into how dynamic learning systems may better nurture the kind of flexible, adaptive thinkers--at all levels of the learning organization--needed in a complex world.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examines empathy, parental attachment, companion pet attachment and social behaviors in a sample of 120 students between the ages of 18-20 enrolled at Front Range Community College in Westminster CO during the fall semester 2008. The study is based on the research questions posed by Thompson and Gullone (2008) but pays particular attention to the relationships between and among variables measured in that study as well as their association with variables indicating companion pet companionship. The research questions are: (1) does parental empathic attachment predict prosocial and antisocial behaviors during older adolescence or young adulthood? And (2) does pet attachment compensate for low parental attachment? The hypotheses are that (1) parental attachment varies directly with empathy, humane treatment of animals, and prosocial behavior and inversely with antisocial behavior (animal cruelty); (2) pet attachment varies directly with empathy, humane treatment of animals and prosocial behavior and inversely with antisocial behavior (animal cruelty); and (3) pet attachment compensates for low parental attachment, serving as a moderating variable.The hypothesis that parental attachment varies directly with empathy, humane treatment of animals, and prosocial behavior and inversely with antisocial behavior (animal cruelty) was not supported by the overall results as parental attachment was not significantly associated with any variables. There was support for the hypothesis that companion pet attachment varies directly with empathy and humane treatment of animals; but there was no association between companion pet attachment and parental attachment or animal cruelty. In this study, it was found that the variance in humane treatment of animals and animal cruelty could only be accounted for by empathy; parental attachment explained 1% of variance in prosocial behavior. The hypothesized mediating role of empathy was not supported in these findings nor was the moderating role of companion pet attachment. For the 18-20 year old sample it does not appear that secure parental attachment relationships is associated with empathy, humane treatment of animals, companion pet attachment, or prosocial behavior toward humans.There were a number of limitations related to the scales used in this study as the researcher attempted to replicate the Thompson and Gullone (2008) study. Further research might utilize scales already standardized with older adolescents and young adults.Additionally, this researcher suggests further research into the concept of &quot;emerging adulthood&quot; as the age range studied falls between adolescence and young adulthood.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation is a critical investigation of the politics of identity among the U.S. diasporic Vietnamese community, in particular, the discourse of authenticity that has been prevalent in the community and its (in)adequacy as a means of displacing racialization and othering as a minoritized community.  Using a critical phenomenological approach, the study consisted of interviews with 14 Vietnamese subjects currently living in the U.S. whose family heritage(s) are traceable, in part or in whole, to Vietnam and/or who are racially marked as bearers of Vietnamese culture.  A thematic analysis of  the interviewees&apos; personal stories uncovered three ideological challenges to authenticating Vietnamese identity: (1) an admission to a lack in historical knowledge of Vietnam, (2) have challenged the governance of Vietnamese-ness through an American/Vietnamese dichotomy of identity, and (3) the development of a &quot;old yet new&quot; identity as a potential alternative articulation of identity for younger generations of Vietnamese Americans.  An examination of the implications of such thematics for displacing racialization of the community shows both the understandable logic that gave rise to practices of cultural authentication as a survival strategy and at the same time the inadequacy of  such practices for bridging the existing disconnect between the identity signifiers &quot;Vietnamese&quot; and &quot;American&quot; and for the continued constitution of Vietnamese subjects as &quot;other,&quot; as possessing a foreign and non-American identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Receiving confidential disclosures can create burdens for pastoral care providers.  This dissertation presents a study of pastoral confidentiality and the burdens associated with receiving confidential disclosures based on interviews with thirteen pastoral providers, a review of historical, legal and pastoral care literature.  A thematic analysis of interviews identified three types of burdens associated with receiving confidential disclosures:  1) professional burdens associated with clarifying norms and standards for pastoral confidentiality in light of collegial, denominational and congregational norms; 2) ethical burdens created when the ethical value of pastoral confidentiality comes into conflict with another significant ethical value; and 3) structural burdens that result from serving in a designated confidential role, factors of the provider&apos;s identity, or contextual considerations about one&apos;s ministry setting.  Interviews revealed that many pastoral providers are unaware of denominational statements and resources addressing normative standards for pastoral confidentiality.  Additionally, serving in a designated confidential role can contribute to a heightened risk of what I term receptivity fatigue.  This study suggests that failing to think theologically about confidentiality runs the risk of impoverishing pastoral practice.  While legal considerations, professional codes of ethics, and social norms for confidentiality remain useful, losing a theological context for practices of confidentiality diminishes the resources available to pastoral caregivers to engage and manage the potential stress and burdens of receiving confidential disclosures.In this dissertation I argue that optimal relational trust characterizes divine engagement with creation, and therefore provides the most fruitful foundation for and expression of pastoral confidentiality.  Drawing on resources in process theology, philosophy, and psychology I present a pastoral theology of confidentiality based on a model of optimal relational trust situated within an understanding of covenantal relationship.  This model provides a resource for managing the burdens resulting from receiving confidential disclosures by balancing receptive and agential dimensions of power, situating the tasks of care within an understanding of relational covenant that prioritizes loving mercy and doing justice, and reclaiming theology as a resource for managing ethical dilemmas arising in the course of pastoral care.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study demonstrates how caring and creative secondary level visual arts classes facilitate the development of learning environments that enliven and expect the best of students; help them develop as autonomous and creative learners; provide them opportunities to care for others and the world around them; and keep them connected to their schools and education. It highlights how the intentions and operations of teachers impact student learning, creative risk taking, and interpersonal relations within and beyond the classroom. It also uncovers novel ways of thinking about arts education as a means to enhance positive individual and social development and vividly illustrates the conceptual frameworks and pedagogical methods used to do so. Four questions initiated the study: 1) What are the intentions of visual arts teachers who state that they believe creative and caring environments are essential for arts instruction and students&apos; holistic development? 2) How are these intentions realized (or not realized) in their practice? 3) How does the enacted curriculum affect students&apos; willingness to take creative risks? and 4) How do the intentions and practices of the teacher impact student self-concepts? Six teachers in three Colorado and three Western Australian schools participated in the study, hosting classroom observations for between five and 10 days at each site. The teachers, as well as 25 students (three to five per teacher), participated in semi-structured interviews in addition to the observations. The students also completed photo essays that reflected what their visual arts experiences meant for them within and beyond the classroom. The use of educational criticism and connoisseurship and the photo essays yielded vivid descriptions. These in turn facilitated the development of interpretations, thematics, and evaluations that inform our understanding and enhance our ability to help students within visual arts and other content area classrooms. The theoretical and methodological choices guiding the study moved existing work in new directions. Theoretically the study drew heavily upon Nel Noddings&apos; care theory but explicitly expanded her ideas to include key elements of care theory for culturally diverse learners. The addition of photo essays was based on recent support for having participants utilize metaphor through photographic images to more effectively express their feelings, beliefs, and interpretations; the application of this method tremendously enhanced the findings.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>COLLEGE SEARCH FACTORS THAT IMPACT COLLEGE MATRICULATION  FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRAXIS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>College access is a top educational priority in the United States as millions of federal and state dollars are funneled into programs to ensure college access for all students, minorities and low-income students in particular (U.S. Department of Education, 2009a; U.S. Department of Education, 2009b).  Over 80% of high school students and their parents aspire to attain postsecondary education (Dounay, 2006; Institute for Higher Education Policy, 2007).  Yet, minorities&apos; and low-income students&apos; ability to penetrate postsecondary doors remains relatively depressed in comparison to their non-minority high-income student peers (Freeman, 2005; Perna, 2007).  Most of the research related to college access focuses on a student&apos;s predisposition to attend college (e.g., income, parental education levels and involvement, and academic achievement/rigor) or student college choice (Hossler, Schmit, &amp; Vesper, 1999; Perna, 2005).  Few researchers (Cabrera &amp; LaNasa, 2000; Bell, Rowan-Kenyon, &amp; Perna, 2009; De la Rosa, 2006) have investigated factors related to the stage in between college predisposition and college choice where students gather information regarding the college-going process, presenting a gap in the literature.  For those recent studies that address how college knowledge impacts college entry, most of them place an emphasis on knowledge regarding financial aid and college tuition pricing (Bell, Rowan-Kenyon, &amp; Perna, 2009; De la Rosa, 2006).  To expand the higher education literature pertaining to college access and choice, this study examines cross-sectional data from ELS:2002 using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) to explain how obtaining college knowledge regarding the college-going process (i.e., participating in a college preparation program or obtaining information from a high school counselor regarding college attendance) impacts college matriculation for African Americans in comparison to their counterparts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Although it may sound reasonable that American education continues to be more effective at sending high school students to college, in a study conducted in 2009, The Council of the Great City Schools states that &quot;slightly more than half of entering ninth grade students arrive performing below grade level in reading and math, while one in five entering ninth grade students is more than two years behind grade level...[and] 25% received support in the form of remedial literacy instruction or interventions&quot; (Council of the Great City Schools, 2009).  Students are distracted with technology (Lei &amp; Zhao, 2005), family (Xu &amp; Corno, 2003), medical illnesses (Nielson, 2009), learning disabilities and perhaps the most detrimental to academic success, the very lack of interest in school (Ruch, 1963).  In a Johns Hopkins research study, Building a Graduation Nation - Colorado (Balfanz, 2008), warning signs were apparent years before the student dropped out of high school.  The ninth grade was often referenced as a critical point that indicated success or failure to graduate high school.  The research conducted by Johns Hopkins illustrates the problem: students who become disengaged from school have a much greater chance of dropping out of high school and not graduating.The first purpose of this study was to compare different measurement models of the Student School Engagement (SSE) using Factor Analysis to verify model fit with student engagement.The second purpose was to determine the extent to which the SSE instrument measures student school engagement by investigating convergent validity (via the SSE and Appleton, Christenson, Kim and Reschly&apos;s instrument and Fredricks, Blumenfeld, Friedel and Paris&apos;s instrument), discriminant validity (via Huebner&apos;s Student Life Satisfaction Survey) and criterion-related validity (via the sub-latent variables of Aspirations, Belonging and Productivity and student outcome measures such as achievement, attendance and discipline).  Discriminant validity was established between the SSE and the Appleton, Christenson, Kim and Reschly&apos;s model and Fredricks, Blumenfeld, Friedel and Paris&apos;s (2005) Student Engagement Instruments (SEI).  When confirming discriminant validity, the SSE&apos;s correlations were weak and statistically not significant, thus establishing discriminant validity with the SLSS.  Criterion-related validity was established through structural equation modeling when the SSE was found to be a significant predictor of student outcome measures when both risk score and CSAP scores were used.The third purpose of this study was to assess the factorial invariance of the SSE instrument across gender to ensure the instrument is measuring the intended construct across different groups.  Conclusively, configural, weak and metric invariances were established for the SSE as a non-significant change in chi-square indicating that all parameters including the error variances were invariant across groups of gender.Engagement is not a clearly defined psychological construct; it requires more research in order to fully comprehend its complexity.  Hopefully, with parental and teacher involvement and a sense of community, student engagement can be nurtured to result in a meaningful attachment to school and academic success.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Contemporary therapeutic circles utilize the concept of anxiety to describe a variety of disorders. Emotional reductionism is a detriment to the therapeutic community and the persons seeking its help. This dissertation proposes that attention to the emotion of fear clarifies our categorization of particular disorders and challenges emotional reductionism. I propose that the emotion of fear, through its theological relationship to hope, is useful in therapeutic practice for persons who experience trauma and PTSD.I explore the differences between fear and anxiety by deconstructing anxiety. Through this process, I develop four categories which help the emotion of fear stand independent of anxiety in therapy. Temporality, behaviors, antidote and objects are categories which distinguish fear from anxiety. Together, they provide the impetus to explore the emotion of fear.Understanding the emotion of fear requires an examination of its neurophysiological embodiment. This includes the brain structures responsible for fear production, its defensive behaviors and the evolutionary retention of fear. Dual inheritance evolutionary theory posits that we evolved physically and culturally, helping us understand the inescapability of fear and the unique threats humans fear. The threats humans react to develop through subjective interpretations of experience. Sometimes threats, through their presence in our memories and imaginations, inhibit a person&apos;s ability to live out a preferred identity and experience hope.Understanding fear as embodied and subjective is important. Process theology provides a religious framework through which fear can be interpreted. In this framework, fear is developed as an adaptive human response. Moreover, fear is useful to the divine-human relationship, revealing an undercurrent of hope. In the context of the divine-human relationship fear is understood as an initial aim which protects a person &lt;italic&gt;from&lt;/italic&gt; a threat, but also preserves them &lt;italic&gt;for&lt;/italic&gt; novel future relationships.Utilizing a &quot;double-listening&quot; stance, a therapist hears the traumatic narrative and counternarratives of resistance and resilience. These counternarratives express an orientation towards hopeful futures wherein persons thrive through living out a preferred identity. A therapeutic practice incorporating the emotion of fear will utilize the themes of survival, coping and thriving to enable persons to place their traumatic narrative within their meaning systems.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study presents a new approach to determine the controllability and observability of a large scale nonlinear dynamic thermal system using graph-theory. The novelty of this method is in adapting graph theory for nonlinear class and establishing a graphic condition that describes the necessary and sufficient terms for a nonlinear class system to be controllable and observable, which equivalents to the analytical method of Lie algebra rank condition. The graph theory of a directed graph (digraph) is utilized to model the system, and the rule of its adaptation in nonlinear class is defined. Subsequently, necessary and sufficient terms to achieve controllability and observability condition are investigated through the structural property of a digraph called connectability. It will be shown that the connectability condition between input and states, as well as output and states of a nonlinear system are equivalent to Lie-algebra rank condition. This approach has been proven to be easier from a computational point of view and is thus found to be useful when dealing with a large system.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Three decades of change efforts in American urban public school districts to improve educational opportunities for students have had a lackluster impact on student achievement. For students living in areas of concentrated poverty, achievement gaps and drop out rates remain unacceptably high. These gaps were brought into stark relief in the city of New Orleans following the devastating flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August, 2005.This qualitative study is about school change from the perspective of school leaders who were hired to run the converted Orleans Parish schools. These experienced, former Orleans Parish school administrators took on leadership roles in a time of personal hardship and collective uncertainty for the future of the city. They did so with the express charge of improving educational opportunities and demonstrating improved student achievement over the course of the five years granted in their respective charter contracts. Using narrative inquiry, the personal stories of how these leaders went about opening and building their new organizations were mined to discern changes in the routines and practices, referred to in the literature as the grammar of schooling, post-Hurricane Katrina. Through the telling of their stories, evidence of innovation in the systems of schooling, including but not limited to teacher recruitment, induction, and development practices, authority and power distribution, knowledge transmission regarding vision and goals, was examined. The study aimed to illumine the perspectives of these principals regarding their leadership experiences and changes they were making in their organizations to improve student achievement.Through the rapid authorization of conversion charter schools by the OPSB and the state take-over and creation of a majority charter-operated public education portfolio of schools, a new age of accountability has emerged in the city of New Orleans. This study brings to light changes in the grammar of schooling taking place in the conversion charter schools as revealed by the school leaders.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation argues that whiteness and the oppressive structures it creates are maintained, managed, and justified by the religio-cultural tools of white Christians in greater Fort Wayne, IN. This dissertation studies the relationship among the repertoires of white Christians, racism, and white privilege by analyzing the life narratives of self identifiedwhite Christians. I have divided this work into two parts. Part one, comprising Chapters One and Two, outlines the frameworks, theories, and methods I use to analyze the life narratives of the white Christians that I interviewed. In Chapter One I focus on how my research builds on and contributes to the conversations started by Michael Emerson and Christian Smith in their trail-blazing book, Divided By Faith: EvangelicalReligion and the Problem of Race in America (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).Chapter One outlines the significant conclusions made by these scholars, names the criticisms leveled against Emerson and Smith, and states the thesis and assumptions of my work. In Chapter Two I outline frameworks for understanding how cultural and religious tool kits influence interpersonal narratives. Here I&apos;m concerned with the role of cultural and religious repertoires, especially narratives, in the construction of identity and religious beliefs as well as the use of narrative as a method of inquiry and analysis. In the first part of Chapter Two, I argue that dominant cultural and religious repertoires influence personal beliefs that in turn (re)construct cultural and religious repertoires. In the latter part of the chapter, I define narrative inquiry and argue for the legitimacy of its use as a methodology for collecting my research data. Against this background of arguments of narrative identity and cultural tools, Chapters Three and Four, part two, examines the life narratives of twenty research participants and names the religio-cultural tools articulated by these and many other white Christians.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Developing Emotional Security Among Children Who Have Been Adopted</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This study investigated the development of emotional security among 6-10 year old children who have been adopted by exposing them to an experimental condition during which they could engage with either a live dog or a robotic dog. The live dog was a certified therapy dog; the robotic dog was a FurRealÂ® toy marketed by Hasbro as &quot;Biscuit.&quot;  Utilizing a mixed-method embedded experimental design, the experimental condition was intentionally structured to promote engagement between the participant and the dog or robot.  43 children who had been adopted from the child welfare system were randomly assigned to one of two groups.  One group was exposed to a therapy dog (n=22), while another was exposed to the social robotic dog (n=21).  The development of emotional security was targeted for measurement in this study using the &quot;Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,&quot; a test of social understanding that has been linked in the literature to oxytocin- a hormone premised to be a marker of the development of emotional security.  Physiological anxiety was also measured as an indicator of emotional security using the Revised Child Manifest Anxiety Scale-2 (RCMAS-2).  Both measures were administered before and after exposure to the experimental condition.  A linear mixed-effect regression analysis showed that for boys only, there was a significant effect of engagement with either companion on social understanding (p&lt;.01).  Social understanding decreased as engagement increased.  A second model indicated that for boys only, their history of animal cruelty had a significant effect on physiological anxiety (p&lt;.05).  If boys had an animal cruelty history, their anxiety was reduced after the exposure to either the dog or robot.  Interpretations of the findings suggest that there are differences among children who have been adopted and have a history of animal cruelty that differentially influences their development of emotional security.  Social work interventions designed for practice with children who have been adopted will need to assess the presence of these variations and develop appropriate treatment protocols.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper details the development of a scale to more accurately assess depression in men.  It first summarizes the literature on depression, depression assessment, and current research on men and masculinity.  It is argued that current conceptualizations of both depression and masculinity influence prevalence studies, which consistently find that men experience depression half as often as women.  It is argued that an assessment measure that accounts for masculine variants of depression (substance use, anger, withdrawal, and emotional restriction) may identify more frequent depression in men than previously expected.  Next, the paper details the development of a men&apos;s depression scale using classical test theory, followed by psychometric analysis of the scale using Rasch modeling and structural equation modeling.  Implications on use of the scale and issues related to identifying men&apos;s depression are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>During the course of this research a novel method which couples the molecular recognition-triggered photoamplification chain in diaryl ketone adducts of dithiane with a &quot;turn-off&quot; or &quot;turn-on&quot; fluorescence-based assay for the detection of biological targets and ligands, regardless of their nature, through a molecular recognition event has been developed.  This research has included several key steps, the most significant being: (1) the design of fluorophore adducts or dyads which recover fluorescence upon photocleavage for a &quot;turn-on&quot; assay and the identification of fluorophores which are quenched upon the photochemical release of a quencher for a &quot;turn off&quot; assay;  (2) Optimization of the photochemistry and photoamplification of dithiane adducts of benzophenone as it applies to the development of an ultra-sensitive photoamplified fluorescence assay; (3) implementation of the method in the design and fabrication of chips for ultra-sensitive screening of microarrays, and (4) integration of this microchip assay into a fluorescence based signal transducer for ultra-sensitive detection of molecular recognition events.  Proof of concept utilized biotin-avidin recognition, where avidin is coupled to the photochemical sensitizer.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Colorado Women&apos;s College (CWC), a private, Baptist college for women in Denver, Colorado, first welcomed students to its campus in 1909, making it one of only a handful of women&apos;s colleges in the American West, where coeducation predominated. This dissertation describes and interprets the curriculum offered at CWC in the period from 1909 to 1967. The analysis of the curriculum is divided into six eras, marked by moments of curricular change, including the College&apos;s transitions from four-year college to junior college, and back. This project distinguishes CWC as an understudied institution by placing it within the literature on the history of women&apos;s colleges.The study documents academic degrees and courses offered, pedagogical techniques employed, College enrollment figures, and most popular student majors. In addition, the study explores how CWC defined the purpose of education for women through its established curriculum. Comparisons are made between CWC and other women&apos;s colleges and the study includes student responses and reactions to the CWC curriculum.Employing the historical method, this dissertation utilizes primary source documents collected from archival repositories, including College course catalogs, yearbooks, student newspapers, local and national newspapers, alumnae survey questionnaires, oral history transcripts, and more to provide a window on the curriculum at Colorado Women&apos;s College.The study discovers that CWC always offered a diverse curriculum (including liberal arts, domestic, and vocational curricula) that served women&apos;s multiple needs and ever-changing social roles. During the early 20th century, debates raged between those who argued for women&apos;s domestic education to prepare them for future roles as wives and mothers, and those who advocated for a liberal arts education for women, comparable to that offered to men. In the midst of these constant debates over the purpose of education for women, CWC elected to offer a curriculum that reflected both sides. The study concludes that CWC, throughout its history, found ways to balance these competing ideologies so as to never over-emphasize any one position. In particular, the College utilized a personality development program beginning in the 1930s (which became central to CWC&apos;s identity) to maintain traditional and modern ideas regarding women and their education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines the language of divination in the HB, particularly in 1 Samuel 28:3-27--the oft-called &quot;Witch of Endor&quot; passage. My thesis is that much of the vocabulary of divination in this passage and beyond has been mistranslated in authorized English and other translations used in Africa and in scholarly writings. I argue that the woman of Endor is not a witch, which is a label that has a long negative social history and has often led to violence against those so labeled. The woman of Endor is, rather, a diviner, much like other ancient Near Eastern and modern African diviners. She resists an inner-biblical conquest theology and a monologic authoritarian view of divination to assist King Saul by various means, including invoking the spirit of a departed person, Samuel. I suggest that the violence done to the woman of Endor through such mistranslation stems from ideological forces that have been in ascendancy during such periods of translation. These ideological forces have attempted to exert an extra-biblical monologic authoritarian view of divination in the HB in order to serve their own Christian, imperial-colonial, and misogynist interests, all of which have been particularly problematic in the African missionary context. Translators steeped in such ideology, whether consciously or unconsciously, mistranslated what is fundamentally a heteroglossic, polyvalent, dialogic text that seeks to undermine any authoritarian voices in regard to divination.To demonstrate my thesis, I carry out a Hebrew word-study shaped by the theories of Mikhail M. Bakhtin regarding the utterance, heteroglossia, and dialogism in order to understand the designative, connotative, emotive, and associative meanings of the many divinatory terms in the Hebrew Bible. I then examine 1 Samuel 28 and a number of prior translations thereof, using the ideological framework of African-feminist-postcolonial biblical interpreters and translation theories to uncover the hidden ideology or transcript of these translations. Finally, using African contextual / cultural hermeneutics and cross-cultural translation theory, I offer new English, French, and Kisanga translations of this passage that are both faithful to the original text and more appropriate to an inculturated-liberation African Christian hermeneutic, theology, and praxis.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Our nation, if it is going to keep a competitive edge versus the rest of the world, must reform the current system of educating children. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence that implementation of one increasingly popular reform effort, theInternational Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (IBPYP), changes teachers&apos; perceptions of what is important about education, the need for international understanding for all students, and the future of education, in general. This dissertationhelped answer those questions through an extensive study of relevant literature and the use of an on-line survey to analyze results. This research produced a number of keyfindings: teachers positively reported that implementation of the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme impacted their philosophy, influenced their view for international education, influenced teachers&apos; view of what a students&apos; education will look like in future years, and impacted teacher efficacy. In particular, thesurvey found positive mean, median, and mode scores for the IBPYP&apos;s impact on teacher&apos;s philosophy of education. Further studies in different settings need to be conducted to determine whether implementation of the International BaccalaureatePrimary Years Programme positively impacts teachers. If American schools wish to better prepare their students for their world of the future, then studies need to continue to focus on the strategies, programs, and philosophies that will aide them in that quest.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study compared participant comprehension of content in foreign language videos using 2 different advance organizer (AO) strategies. The students were 50 college students enrolled in 3 sections of an intermediate-level Spanish course at the United States Air Force Academy.In the collaborative group reading condition (AOg), students read a target language narrative video script aloud in small groups. Students then watched the video corresponding to the script they had read and took a 10-question English only multiple choice test. In the quiet individual reading condition (AOq), students read the same narrative video script quietly before watching the same video and taking the same test. In the control group condition, students did not have access to the narrative video script AO before watching the same video and taking the same test. Over the 3 day study, all students participated in each of the 3 conditions.Results indicated that student scores were slightly better in the AOg condition than in the AOq condition. Student scores were significantly higher in the AOg and AOq conditions, when compared to control group scores. The researcher concluded that the narrative video script AO strategies utilized in this study increased target language video comprehension in participants, particularly when used in a collaborative group reading environment.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study attempted to determine the relationship between exposure to traumatic experiences of hospitalized children and adolescents and the development of secondary traumatic stress, also known as compassion fatigue, vicarious traumatization, or burnout in clinical staff working with such patients.  Hierarchical regression was used to test the hypotheses that: clinical treatment staff will experience higher levels of psychological distress following exposure to patient trauma and previous lifetime trauma events; clinical treatment staff will experience quality of patient relationships associated with the degree of exposure to patient trauma, previous lifetime or work-related trauma history, and level of supervisor support; clinical treatment staff will experience a quality of professional relationships associated with the degree of exposure to patient trauma, previous lifetime or work-related trauma history, and level of supervisor support; clinical treatment staff will experience a quality of self relationship associated with the degree of exposure to patient trauma, previous lifetime or work-related trauma history, and level of supervisor support.  Measures included a demographic and previous lifetime trauma events survey developed for this study, a Hospital Trauma Scale also developed for this study, the Compassion Fatigue Self-test, the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey (Emotional Exhaustion subscale), and the Supervisor Support Scale.  Results indicated a positive relationship between the development of psychological distress, as evidenced by Compassion Fatigue and Emotional Exhaustion, and exposure to patient trauma and traumatic life events.  Additionally, after the effects of education and experience in domains of care were entered, the contribution of degree of hospital trauma experienced contributed significantly to the occurrence of Compassion Fatigue and Emotional Exhaustion.  The degree of supervisor support, as measured by the Supervisor Support Scale, did not produce a mediating influence relative to the occurrence of Compassion Fatigue or Burnout.  The other findings of interest were that Education played a significant role in the occurrence of Compassion Fatigue and Emotional Exhaustion, as did External Support Sought.  Specifically, higher education and external support sought for work-related stress were associated with lower levels of Compassion Fatigue and Emotional Exhaustion.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Effects of Peer &amp; Familial Ethnic Socialization on Processes of Ethnic Identity Development in Mexican-Descent Adolescents</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The current cross-sectional study had two goals: present the Peer Ethnic Socialization Measure, (PESM) to assess peer contributions to the process of ethnic socialization (the promotion of pride, cultural knowledge and cultural traditions), and explore how family and peer (in-group and out-group peers) ethnic socialization uniquely contributes to the process of ethnic identity development in Mexican descent adolescents (N=111, M age = 14.5 years, SD = 1.2 years).  The PESM is a modified version of the UmaÃ±a-Taylor Familial Ethnic Socialization Scale (2001). Results indicated that the PESM is a reliable scale, but that it will benefit from refinement and additional work on its psychometric soundness given lack of evidence to support convergence-validity criteria. Family ethnic socialization was more predictive of total ethnic identity and its sub-indices of ethnic identity exploration and affirmation than peer ethnic socialization in this sample.    However, out-group peer ethnic socialization was significantly associated with adolescent&apos;s ethnic identity exploration, suggesting peers of different ethnicities play some role in the process of Mexican-descent teens&apos; ethnic identity formation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With advances in drug research, the use of biological therapeutics is becoming a reality.  Unfortunately, methods for processing and delivering these fragile macromolecules often limit their therapeutic potential.  For this dissertation, we explore the aerosolization of macromolecules by way of electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) and how this method can be used to process and deliver therapeutics.  EHDA employs a high voltage to break a column of liquid into drops.  It was unknown if or how the residual charge left of the resulting droplets would affect lung cells.  An in vitro experiment was conducted to spray aerosolized DNA, by way of EHDA, onto human derived lungs cells to test for immunogenic and toxic effects.  The lung cells displayed no immunogenic or toxic response to the DNA or high voltage.  Previous researchers have used EHDA to aerosolize proteins with mixed results.  This work sets forth a simplified thermodynamic theory and provides recommendations to pharmaceutical companies on how to design more stable protein formulations for aerosol processing or delivery.  Finally, a new method of producing liposomes was created.  It constructs the liposome one layer at a time.  The inside of the liposome is sprayed by EHDA, with the lipid and drug in solution together.  As the sprayed monolayer passes through a pool containing a solution of lipid in water, the second part of the bilayer attaches to the inner layer creating a complete bilayer liposome.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Embracing resistance at the margins: First-generation Latino students&apos; testimonios on dual/concurrent enrollment high school programs.</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Despite moderate gains in equal educational opportunities over the past 60 years, low-income students of color continue to lag behind their middle-class, White peers. This is particularly true for first-generation Latina/o students who: (a) have the highest K-12 drop-out rate than any other ethnic group in U.S. schools; (b) are underrepresented in high quality, rigorous secondary curricular tracks; and (c) continue to be overrepresented in two-year institutions and postsecondary vocational schools. Using a conceptual framework comprised of critical race theory (CRT), social theory, and community cultural wealth theory it was clear that the U.S. education system is still plagued by systemic and endemic racism. Contrary to the predominate neoliberal discourse that emerged in the education field after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, it is clear that meritocracy is a myth and students continue to face disproportionate opportunities to learn. One of the current school reform initiatives being used to help underrepresented students not only gain access to four-year institutions but also persist to the attainment of a Bachelor&apos;s of Arts (B.A.) degree are dual/concurrent enrollment high school programs. Multicultural and antiracist educators argue that these programs may fall short of reaching their intended outcomes if the teaching staff does not utilize culturally relevant curriculum and pedagogy. Research findings show that students of color learn best in environments where they feel welcomed and valued. At the time of this study very little evidence existed showing whether or not dual/concurrent enrollment programs were reaching their intended outcomes for underrepresented students. In addition, the literature was unclear to what extent, if at all, culturally relevant curriculum and pedagogy were being integrated into these programs. Using testimonio narrative inquiry (TNI) as methodology the researcher attempted to address this gap in the literature. The primary method for data collection was in-depth interviewing. In total, six Latino students were interviewed on three separate occasions for 90 minute intervals. First, individual narratives were developed by analyzing and coding the data within each individual case. Next, a collective narrative emerged by analyzing and synthesizing the major themes across the cases. The major finding of this study indicates that significant improvements need to take place in order for dual/concurrent enrollment programs to be a viable pathway for first-generation Latina/o students to persist to the attainment of a B.A. degree.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A consensus on climate change is spurring an energy transition, but the geography of this transition is uneven and this paper evaluates the energy landscape globally, in the United States and in Colorado.  Developed countries have taken the lead in installations and of next generation energy technology ownership.  Green electricity has still not achieved parity with fossil fuels, which puts their adoption in the hands of policy makers who are trying to spur innovation with minimal financial disruption.  Yet the future of green electricity is in question due to weak and fragmented policy regimes, but also because of inadequate R&amp;D levels.  Wind is maturing with large global players and a settling of technology, but solar is marked by scattered manufacturing and fluctuating technology platforms.  Within the United States, venture capital (VC) is playing an active role for the cleantech sector; cleantech encompasses broad themes of sustainability to include electricity as well as materials, buildings, water, energy software, and recycling.  Cleantech is among the leading economic sectors securing the most VC money and the future geographic landscape is likely to feature California and Massachusetts, who lead as the top destinations of cleantech VC money, but other pockets of innovation are clear.  Finally, while large urban utilities are prepared to transition away from fossil fuels, smaller cities and rural areas, for various financial and scale issues are disadvantaged with incorporating more green energy into their electricity mix.  This was evident by the results of Colorado&apos;s Amendment 37, which created a statewide RPS and passed with strong support in the Denver metro area, but limited support in the rest of the state.  Nevertheless, all utilities must now diversify and this study surveyed the managers at the state&apos;s rural utilities to gauge their attitudes concerning: carbon legislation, conservation and efficiency programs, and their plans for making the electricity transition.  Nearly all of the utilities are making progress, but there is broad apprehension and distrust about mandates and the impacts on their communities.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>ETHICAL ELITISM: A BURKEAN ANALYSIS OF THE RHETORICAL CONSTRUCTION OF A MORAL PERSONA IN THE FIRST TERM OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH</dc:title>

  <dc:description>On November 4, 2004, President George W. Bush won re-election.  According to exit polls, a majority of people who voted for Bush over his opponent, Senator John Kerry, did so because they believed that Bush was the &quot;moral values&quot; candidate.  In this dissertation, I assess the moral persona that the President rhetorically constructed during his first term in office.  To do so, I utilize Kenneth Burke&apos;s cluster and pentad tools to analyze Bush&apos;s statements on embryonic stem cell research, 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror, and same-sex marriage, three issues that the elite press explicitly identified as being &quot;moral values&quot; during Bush&apos;s first term.The analyses reveal that Bush&apos;s rhetoric frames the ethical struggle as being between himself and an elite/powerful few others.   The majority of Americans are thus stripped of their agent status and the corresponding ability to act and left to feel the effects of a &quot;moral&quot; decision that is made in their absence yet affects their very being.  I term this sort of ethics &quot;elitist ethics&quot; as ethics and morality are made to seem like a power struggle between an elite few.  In the conclusion I assess the effects of elitist ethics in the public sphere.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>While depression is considered the most common mental illness regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, compared to research on the general population, depression among psychologists has received little attention. However, as they are one of the major mental health care professionals, psychologists&apos; mental health could greatly affect their clients&apos; mental health, which raises competency and ethical concerns regarding their work as clinicians. In order to learn more about depression in this group, questionnaires were mailed to 800 randomly selected psychologists in the state of Colorado to examine the prevalence of depression among psychologists, how they dealt with their own depression, their concerns regarding competency and ethics, and the existential meaning of their depression. Nine participants responded to an invitation to be individually interviewed regarding their personal experience of depression.The results indicated a higher prevalence of depression among psychologists than in the general population. However, no significant gender differences regarding the prevalence of depression were found. The majority of psychologists reported being aware of their own depression, however, regardless of their expertise, several reported that they were not aware of their own depression. The majority of psychologists accepted the diagnosis either positively or objectively. However, some accepted it negatively, expressing such feelings as shame. The majority of psychologists who experienced depression eventually sought treatment. However, one third of the psychologists did not seek treatment, but instead utilized their own coping skills. A few psychologists mentioned a confidentiality concern as a reason for not seeking treatment.Regarding competency, most psychologists did not think their own depression interfered with their professional competence. Regarding ethical concerns, nearly half of the psychologists answered it is ethical to practice as long as the psychologist is aware of his/her symptoms and limitations. One third of the psychologists answered the capacity to practice depends on the severity of the depression. Although most psychologists rated their experience of depression positively, stating that it enhanced their understanding of their clients, personal interviews revealed that a stigma about depression or mental illness in general still exists among psychologists. Most of the interviewed psychologists stated that they were very cautious about disclosing their experience of depression to their colleagues due to a concern for their reputation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined family influences on coping and adjustment among 90 low-income Latino middle school children (46% Female; Average age = 11.38, SD = .66) and their primary caregivers (93% Female; Average age = 36.12, SD = 6.13).  All participants identified as Hispanic/Latino, with 75% of families identifying as Mexican-origin Latino, 77% of parents identifying as immigrants, and 32% of children identifying immigrants.  All children participating in the study were receiving free or reduced lunch, a poverty indicator.  Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that family reframing is related to fewer symptoms of psychopathology and that familism enhances the protective effect of family reframing, while passive appraisal is linked to worse functioning.  Path analyses showed that family reframing also has indirect effects on symptoms through child primary control coping.  Additional analyses identified family mobilizing support and family ethnic socialization as potential contributors to child secondary control coping. Family mobilizing support may also be helpful for single-parent families, while family spiritual support is helpful for immigrant families.  Qualitative findings from an initial focus group and from the larger sample are also discussed.  Results are discussed with regard to the implications of this research for preventive interventions with families in poverty. Understanding the protective links of family coping and cultural strengths to mental health outcomes of poor children can influence intervention or prevention programming and policy targeting at-risk youth and families.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Foreign Language Comprehension: Understanding the Centrality Deficit</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The goal of this study was to determine how reading in a foreign language (L2) affects one&apos;s mental representation of the text and the ability to recognize and recall the text&apos;s important information. Using a within-participants design, the proportion of central and peripheral ideas recalled by participants reading in their L2 was compared to that when reading in their native language (L1).  Readers recalled a greater proportion of central than peripheral ideas when reading in both their L2 and L1, but when their L2 and L1 recalls were directly compared, a very interesting, yet counterintuitive, result emerged. The greatest deficit in participants&apos; L2 compared to L1 recalls was on the central, rather than peripheral, information. It is counterintuitive that the ideas that participants reading in their L2 recall the best (i.e., central ideas) are also the ideas on which they show the biggest deficit relative to their L1 recall. It is proposed that this centrality deficit stems from readers having to devote more cognitive resources to L2 word identification and consequently having fewer resources remaining to form connections among the text&apos;s ideas that allow centrality to emerge.  The centrality deficit was only evident among the readers who had a lower level of L2 proficiency (i.e., those for whom L2 word identification was most difficult), which supports the theory that the centrality deficit is the result of comprehending with limited resources. Additionally, having prior knowledge of the passage topic served as a compensatory mechanism for the centrality deficit.  Specifically, readers with less L2 proficiency who did not have prior knowledge of the topic displayed a centrality deficit relative to their L1 recall, but this deficit dissipated when they did possess topic knowledge. This study provides insight into L2 discourse comprehension and suggests that evaluating the quality of L2 readers&apos; text recall is a worthwhile assessment that can reveal deficiencies in L2 text representations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation comprehensively evaluates, for the first time, nonviolence and its relationship to International Relations (IR) theory and US foreign policy along the categories of principled, strategic, and regulative nonviolence.  The current debate within nonviolence studies is between principled and strategic nonviolence as relevant categories for theorizing nonviolent resistance.  Principled nonviolence, while retaining the primacy of ethics, is often not practical.  Indeed, most nonviolent movements have not been principled, or solely principled.  Strategic nonviolence is attractive because it does not require any individual or group to believe in a particular faith or ethical tradition.  However, strategic nonviolence is problematic as a source for action because it empties nonviolence of ethical content.  If left with only the categories of principled and strategic nonviolence any analysis of US foreign policy is hampered by either principled nonviolence&apos;s impracticability or by the possibility that strategic nonviolence will be used for unethical ends, what I term &quot;imperial nonviolence.&quot;  This tension led me to search for a middle path between principled and strategic nonviolence.  &quot;Regulative nonviolence&quot; is so-called because the concept owes an intellectual debt to Immanuel Kant.  It is theoretically possible to argue for a US foreign policy that is grounded in the regulative ideal of nonviolence while it is nearly impossible to get from the current American policy of overwhelming force to one of principled nonviolence.  In the end, regulative nonviolence is more ideal than strategic nonviolence, it retains the ethical core of principled nonviolence without removing all forms of violence from its operational tool kit.  However, it is also more &quot;realistic&quot; than principled nonviolence because it recognizes that politics is the art of the possible.  In this sense, this dissertation owes a debt not just to Kant but also to Machiavelli, with a slight twist.  While NicolÃ³ Machiavelli argued that political leaders must learn how &quot;not to be good&quot; I am arguing that they must learn how to be good, or, at least, to be less violent in their pursuit of political change.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explored the experiences of seven Afghan women pursuing doctoral degrees in a variety of disciplines and programs across the United States.  The guiding question for this study was: What factors influence Afghan women&apos;s journeys to and experiences in doctoral programs?In an attempt to understand Afghan women doctoral students, I provided a historical background of Afghanistan and education in Afghanistan followed by a literature review on South Asian women, the broader category for Afghan women.  Within this literature review I explored the following components: culture, gender, immigration, experiences in postsecondary education; all factors that may be influential in the journey of South Asian women in U.S. postsecondary education.  Finally, a critical race feminism theoretical framework was utilized to fuse the factors affecting South Asian women in higher education and provide a theoretical guide for further research specifically investigating Afghan women in doctoral programs.Through the use of narrative inquiry, I provided an individual and collective story of the lives of seven Afghan women in U.S. doctoral programs.  From these stories, four themes emerged as influential in the lives of the participants.  The four themes that emerged were faith, identity, capital, and family.Upon a thorough investigation of the themes and multiple sub-themes, several implications and recommendations were made.  The findings of the study showed that there are no formulas to understand the complexities in the lives of Afghan women doctoral students, but several intersecting identities and factors that create the journey and help the reader understand their experiences.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The American creed of &lt;italic&gt;e pluribus unum&lt;/italic&gt;--out of many, one--has proven to be an elusive aspiration for societies throughout history.  Research suggests that as the diversity of a community increases, its stores of social capital decline.  Yet, there exists a growing body of evidence that suggests under certain conditions, patterns of inclusion and collaboration are not only possible but predictable.  This project explores theory on effective communication practices, grounded in Habermas&apos;s Theory of Communicative Action, as well as research on effective group interaction to suggest that certain communicative capacities and collaborative processes that successfully face the challenge of  &lt;italic&gt;e pluribus unum&lt;/italic&gt;at the level of groups and organizations might also apply to broader communities. After reviewing a series of case studies, a community learning model is offered as a way to promote those conditions more intentionally under a broader &quot;civic canopy&quot; as a way to help establish a new set of community norms--or a new civic operating system--that regards civil society as a type of associational ecosystem that can enable communities to better learn and adapt to the challenges they face.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Development of the talents and abilities of gifted children is not ordinarily provided by regular public school programs. Their need for accelerated, complex, and challenging curriculum and processes is often overlooked by educators focused on helping underperforming students to reach grade-level standards. Gifted high school students who are proficient in persuasive writing are able to clearly state a claim, support that claim with evidence and backing, recognize and rebut counterclaims, and draw a conclusion leading to action. If gifted students are proficient at writing persuasively, perhaps they are also able to advocate for learning experiences that are challenging, complex, and accelerated so that they are developing their gifted potential. Belief that one can produce desired outcomes by one&apos;s actions is the power of human agency. This study examined the following research question. What is the relationship between identified gifted high school students&apos; proficiency in persuasive writing and those students&apos; beliefs about their own powers of agency? The results shed light on the potential that proficiency in persuasive writing may have on gifted students&apos; powers of agency to have their academic needs met.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Social networks and capital often sustain community and individual survival. This phenomenological study was designed to illuminate the experience of job loss within the context of globalization, describing the phenomenon from the perspective of rural women and its meaning for those participants. Using a phenomenological approach, this qualitative study explored eight rural women in Appalachian Kentucky who had experienced apparel factory layoffs as a result of global outsourcing. A modified form of van Kaam&apos;s method (Moustakas, 1994) was used for phenomenological analysis of the data. Data were analyzed using an eight-step technique to identify essential characteristics of rural women&apos;s lived experiences and to discover &quot;what&quot; attitudes ex-factory workers had toward job loss and &quot;how&quot; social support networks were developed. A description of the experience and its meaning was developed from the five salient themes that emerged. These major themes include impact of job layoffs; emotional effects of a shuttered plant; rural resiliency; social support networks at the individual, family, and community level; and cultural challenges to social support networks. Findings of the study suggest participants perceived their cultural values and heritage as an important resource toward creating viable socioeconomic pathways and by providing a psychological buffer against stress. Implications for social work practice, research and education, and policy were discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Sustained achievement remains out of reach for most Title I schools.  While there are many programs and examples of schools touting improved performance, there are precious few that are able to maintain that improved performance over time.  This case study examined the characteristics of changes made at one Colorado Title I elementary school that did see improved growth for a period of four years.  Two administrators, five teachers and two classified staff members were interviewed.  Two of the staff members were also parents at the school. This study utilized a qualitative methodology to examine the changes made that lead to sustained improvement.  Observations of classroom instruction, collaborative meetings and interviews were conducted to collect data.  Elliot Eisner&apos;s qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship was selected to organize and classify the data.Through in-depth interviews these staff members identified and examined the changes implemented over the last four years that contributed to the sustained achievement at Amazing Elementary School. They examined structural changes, delineation of instructional focus, a targeted curriculum, training and hiring of staff.  This study is relevant to all schools, most especially those facing higher than normal poverty rates and challenges associated with diverse populations.Conclusions reached are as follows: the common qualities found among the groups was an unwavering focus on student growth, strong acknowledgement and appreciation of staff efforts, connecting peers with purpose, effective communication between staff, parents and students and on-going professional collaboration.  All of these areas build and contribute to the effectiveness of one another.  It was not the implementation of any one factor that attributed to the success of Amazing Elementary School, but rather it was the persistence of many factors that when combined together fashioned a well- orchestrated  symphony of sustained improvement.School Districts need to work to allow challenged schools to remove obstacles preventing them from creating similar environments.  Schools need to structure their environments to promote greater collaborative time for teachers in order to better analyze the needs of students and develop structures and lessons to meet these needs. Teachers need to improve their skills at analyzing data and they need better more efficient ways at assessing students&apos; learning.  Pre-service teachers need to participate in improved residency programs that allow them greater opportunities for side-by-side coaching and mentoring from master teachers.Finally, this case study has provided practical advice on how to better address the needs of students in title I school for district administrators, school administrators, and teachers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the biomedical field the need for intra organ pressure measurement can only be facilitated by adapting existing pressure sensing technology to the specific tissues under test.  The customization of these sensors has only driven up cost and the need to explore new technologies has become increasingly more important.  For this dissertation, we explore the use of a new technology, particularly electrochemical pressure sensing to provide a low-cost pressure sensor to fill this need.  Preliminary testing showed that electrically conductive polymers exhibited a change in voltage when pressurized if bubbles were first electrolyzed in the gel creating an aerogel, and that this effect was virtually undetectable without the bubbles present.  Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and model fitting, it was shown that this effect occurs at the electrode interface.  Theoretical derivation supported by potentiostatic voltage measurements indicated that a change in the electrode surface area in contact with the fluid was responsible for the effect.  Optical micrographs were taken as a bubble along the electrode was pressurized.  Using image analysis, the relationship of the change in surface area of the bubble correlated to the relationship of the change in impedance of the electrochemical cell (ECC).  The results further demonstrated that the electrochemical response to pressure of a gelatin aerogel electrode was linear for the pressure range of 0 to1034 mmHg.  This finding lends itself well for use in medical devices.  A new device was invented along with a manufacturing process for an electrochemical pressure transducer (EPT).  The EPT was subject to in vitro testing using simulated gastric fluid to create a baseline efficacy of the device for use in the gastrointestinal tract.  Multiple design specific techniques were developed to improve sensor performance during physiological conditions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined vocabulary acquisition of elementary students in grades kindergarten through fifth in one rural New Mexico school.  The school had 277 students.   Hispanic students comprised nearly 80% of the student body.  All students received free lunch and breakfast.  The 65 students who participated in the study were assessed using the Montgomery Assessment of Vocabulary Acquisition (MAVA).  This new assessment, published in 2008, tests receptive and expressive vocabulary utilizing the three-tier vocabulary model introduced by Beck, McKeown and Kucan (2001).  The study assessed each student for proficiency in identifying and using tier-I, tier-II and tier-III words.  Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants were compared with respect to their tier-I, tier-II, and tier-III proficiency using analysis of covariance with three candidate covariate factors:  participant grade in school, gender, and caregiver level of education.  Results of the study demonstrated that Hispanic participants and non-Hispanic students performed equally well in tier-I expressive and tier-II and tier-III expressive and receptive vocabulary.  Caregiver level of education showed statistical significance for tier-I expressive and tier-II receptive vocabulary results.  Participant grade level was found to be statistically significant in both expressive and receptive scores for all three-tier levels.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With the increase in the number of students with disabilities taking part in colleges and universities nationwide (U.S. Department of Education, 2003; Horn &amp; Nevill, 2006; Schuh, 2000; Collins &amp; Mowbray, 2005), the role of disability service providers is indispensible. The underlying principle of this study was to explore the working conditions of disability service providers, their roles as middle managers, and duties inherent to their position. The review of literature summarized the progression of disability services on the college or university campus, the application of organizational development theory, and the role of middle managers. This synopsis of the role of the middle managers was used as the basis of the conceptual framework.A web-based survey was developed to identify the level of job satisfaction ratings of disability service providers with regards to managing information, overseeing funds, influencing culture, and building a career. The main purpose of this study was to achieve a greater understanding of how organizational factors influenced levels of job satisfaction among disability service providers and examine perceived responses that both restrict and support their satisfaction levels.A web-based Service Provider Job Satisfaction Survey (SPJSS) was developed and distributed to 472 disability service providers at postsecondary institutions within the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education (WICHE) states. Results of the study indicated that building a career was an important organizational factor and years in the field had a significant impact on the level of job satisfaction. Outcomes from this study can be used as a means to identify the importance of various duties and responsibilities of disability service providers and organizational factors that could contribute to their satisfaction on the job. This study confirms the need for future research regarding organizational factors that could contribute to the level of job satisfaction of directors who provide services and supports for students at postsecondary institutions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In order to assess the evolutionary understanding of high school biology teachers, an instrument entitled the Classroom Test of Evolutionary Reasoning (CTER) was developed.  Content, response process, relations to another variable (the Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection, or CINS), and internal structure evidence were compiled.  The second version of the CTER was found to have adequate reliability and validity estimates to allow it to continue to be used as a measurement tool for an understanding of evolution.  When assessing a sample of teachers (n = 724), the mean score was 6.35 out of a possible 13 points.  The sample was found to possess an adequate understanding of Lamarkian evolution, but had difficulties with common ancestry, evolutionary trees, transitional fossils, and homologous structures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the effects of altered item order on attitude measures for both computerized adaptive and conventional survey formats. Based on items modified from a dissertation/thesis completion survey (Green &amp; Kluever, 1997) with three scales, three survey versions were generated with items ordered by difficulty as hard-to-easy (H-E), easy-to-hard (E-H), and five medium trait level items presented first followed by randomly ordered items (M-R) for conventional survey format. Significant differences in item difficulty and item discrimination were found for two of the three scales. Differences in scale reliability were detected for the procrastination and responsibility scales. Also, significant correlations between scale total score and scale attitude strength were discovered with each survey version.Further, two computerized adaptive survey version were generated. One began with items at medium and the other at extremely high trait levels. Results showed significant differences in number of items administered to achieve a set level of precision for two scales and significant differences in reaction time were found for one scale between the two versions. The version of item starting at the extreme trait level required more items, and took longer to respond to.  Further, significant differences in the estimated person parameter were found for one scale between the two survey versions. Based on the results of both survey formats indicating item order effects pose a problem for assessing attitude.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Service learning, a natural link between community service and standards-based education, encourages students to learn about themselves in the context of the world in which they live. In other words, service learning is a method of teaching that enriches learning by engaging students in meaningful service to their schools and communities, and integrating that service with established curricula or learning objectives (NYLC Service-Learning Glossary, 2005). Educational service activities can be done directly or indirectly and they can have a varying degree of &quot;involvement&quot; ranging from community service, community exploration, community action or advocacy and research. In this study, a service learning project at a rural middle school was evaluated. The project was a result of a response to a community need and was seen as a way to reinforce academic skills for an entire 5th grade class.The purpose of this study was to describe a middle school service learning project and its influence on student learning and empowerment.  Gender differences for both of these areas were also considered. Specifically, the study looked at three areas: academic gains, overall perceptions about the project and students&apos; perceptions about making a difference in their communities.  In order to do this effectively, middle level learning, motivation, engagement and student voice, as they pertain to the students&apos; sense of empowerment in helping a community, were taken into account.This was a mixed methodology case study and a pragmatic approach to this analysis was used, where the quantitative data (from surveys) revealed some of the initial information and then qualitative elements from the surveys, journals and observations were added to offer support for the statistical findings.Almost all groups made gains between the pre-survey and post survey on hunger awareness and fraction concepts, but it is impossible to know if those gains were due to the service learning project or other factors. On-task behaviors, as a measurement of project engagement, were examined and were high for most parts of the project as well.Most students stated that they had a positive service learning experience (91%) and that they felt they could make a difference in their community (91%). To evaluate these findings further, analyses were performed that looked at responses to journal prompts and other open-ended questions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&lt;bold&gt;Abstract&lt;/bold&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine whether law students experienced library anxiety and, if so, which components contributed to that anxiety. The Multidimensional Library Anxiety Scale (MLAS) developed by Dr. Doris Van Kampen was used to assess library anxiety levels of law students. The MLAS is a 53 question Likert scale instrument that measures the construct of library anxiety. Participants in the study were law students enrolled in a private midwestern university during the 2009-2010 academic year who completed the survey instrument.Law students are a unique graduate school population who undergo an extremely rigorous and competitive course of study, which often involves detailed legal research. As a result, they frequently utilize the library, whether on-site or online. If law students suffer from high levels of library anxiety, it could impact their ability to complete assignments and achieve high academic excellence. Through better understanding of law students&apos; library anxiety levels, law school educators and librarians may be in a position to begin reducing or alleviating those anxieties.Due to the fact that this was the first time the MLAS was used with law students and only its second use, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed. The confirmatory factor analysis resulted in an inadequate fit. As a result, a principal components analysis was undertaken, which resulted in six components that were somewhat similar, but not identical, to the prior research study using the MLAS instrument. The six identified components were named as follows: (i) general library and research anxiety (LibResearch); (ii) comfort with technology and online access (TechOnline); (iii) perceived value of the understanding how to use the library (ValueLib); (iv) comfort with the library as a physical place (ComfortLib); (v) perceived value of using the library in-person (LibInperson); and, (vi) comfort with the library staff (LibStaff).The findings of this study indicated that law students exhibit moderate levels of overall library anxiety and varying levels of library anxiety on the six components. In particular, evening division law students had higher levels of library anxiety as it pertained to comfort with the library staff. Also, law students who used the library in person one or fewer times per semester encountered greater library anxiety as it pertained to general library and research anxiety. Additionally, law students who used the library online one or fewer times per semester had higher library anxiety related to comfort with technology and online access. Results indicated that overall library anxiety and on the six components did not differ based upon gender or year in law school. Lastly, library anxiety on the six components did not differ based upon law students&apos; age or grade point average ranges.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The classical CarathÃ©odory interpolation problem is the following:  let n be a natural number, a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , a&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; be complex numbers, and&lt;bold&gt;D&lt;/bold&gt; the unit disk.  When does there exist an analytic function F : &lt;bold&gt;D&lt;/bold&gt; â &lt;bold&gt;C&lt;/bold&gt; and complex numbers a&lt;sub&gt;N+1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;N+2&lt;/sub&gt;, . . .  such that F(z) = a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;z + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt; + . . . + a&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;super&gt;N&lt;/super&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;N+1&lt;/sub&gt;z&lt;super&gt;N+1&lt;/super&gt; + . . .  and ||F||&lt;sub&gt;â&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1?  In 1967, Sarason used operator theory techniques to give an elegant solution to the CarathÃ©odory interpolation problem.  In 1968, Sz.-Nagy and Foias extended Sarason&apos;s approach into a commutant lifting theorem.  Both the theorem and the technique of the proof have become standard tools in control theory.  In particular, the commutant lifting theorem approach lends itself to a wide range of generalizations.  This thesis concerns one such generalization.Arias presented generalizations of the original commutant lifting theorem relating to the full Fock space.  Popescu then refined the approach by introducing domain algebras.  While Arias and Popescu focused on module maps from one noncommutative domain algebra to itself, we present a unitarily equivalent representation which allows us to easily generalize their results to module maps between different noncommutative domain algebras.  We use a renorming technique to prove that as long as the âformal identity mapâ is bounded, we can lift module maps between different noncommutative domains generated by finite positive regular free holomorphic functions.  Finally, we apply the lifting theorem to create projective resolutions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This phenomenological study was designed to gain insight into male-to-female transsexual clients&apos; experience of clinical relationships. Transsexual clients who enter into a clinical relationship have an experience that is unique due to their transsexual status in society. Their circumstances warrant attention in research due to the following factors: 1) the nature of being transsexual 2) the gate-keeping requirements necessary for transition 3) their experience in society as a vulnerable and oppressed population, and, 4) the importance of understanding the transsexual individuals&apos; experience of clinical relationships from the perspective of  transsexual clients themselves. Twelve transsexual women were interviewed using semi-structured format utilizing open-ended questions regarding their experiences. Participants ranged in age from 30 to 64, and their year&apos;s post-SRS/GRS ranged from 20 months to 33 years. The data was analyzed using Moustakas&apos; modified version of the Van Kaam method of analysis. The findings were grouped into four core themes: What the client brings to the clinical relationship, what the therapist brings to the clinical relationship, the experience of the clinical relationship, and the outcome of the clinical relationship. The essence of the experience is stated as fear driven self-preservation. It was found that participants feared rejection and expressed self-preservation initially by suppressing their transgender identity. After experiencing a crisis and/or catalyst, the participants changed their self-preservation focus to gender role transition, at any cost. The combination of this self-preservation for transition, and fear of clinicians&apos; power in the gate-keeping process provided challenges for therapeutic alliance and trust in the clinical relationship. Participants expressed a change of attitude towards therapy, therapists, and the standards of care post-transition. Implications for social work research, theory, practice, education and policy are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>One of the biggest innovations of the last century has been the invention of the video game.   Video games are an extremely popular form of entertainment today.  While some question the use of video games in education, others argue that video games are one innovation that if introduced into the classroom, might change how teachers effectively engage learners.  This quantitative study examined the impact of Brain Age 2 for the Nintendo DS on seventh grade achievement in math and on student attitude towards school.  A sample of eighty seventh graders from the same school played the Nintendo DS daily for fifteen minutes over nine weeks.  No significant difference was found in math achievement after using the game.  Achievement in mathematics was analyzed with a paired t-test.  Student attitude was measured using a survey and analyzed using nonparametric statistics.  On the survey, students who played the Nintendo DS daily reported a more positive attitude towards their teachers, classes, and school than those that did not play the Nintendo DS.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>It is important to understand thermal transport behavior in materials fortechnological and fundamental physics applications. Many efforts have been made in the past for explaining thermal conduction in solids.It has been observed that thermal transport properties may change with reducing size of the sample, especially as sample size approaches the nanoscale regime. The deviation in these properties, mainly in thermal conductivity, may change the choice of the material for different applications such as thermoelectricity. Thermoelectric materials are a possible source of sustainable energy and can play an important role in the fight against the present energy crisis. Recently, better thermoelectric materials have become available in bulk form as compared to thin film form, with higher figure of merit ($ZT={\alpha}^2 \sigma{T}/\textit{k}$).ZT is a dimensionless quantity which is used to characterize the performance of thermoelectric materials in terms of the efficiency.Figure of merit (ZT) depends on three fundamental properties including thermal conductivity (\textit{k}) which is challenging to measure for thin films. This is due to several reasons such as large or more than one background contribution and radiation heating above 100 K.Precise measurements of thermopower (${\alpha}$) also become critical for thin films in order to calculate ZT and the efficiency.For devices which rely on thin film technology it is important to have an accurate knowledge of how a material behaves as a thin film in a wide range of temperature.  All three of these properties are a function of charge carrier concentration as well as of temperature.In my thesis, I will present novel experimental techniques and measurements of thermoelectric properties in amorphous based thin films over a wide range of temperature. Amorphous Si alloys are expected to have high efficiency for thermoelectric purposesbecause of their low thermal conductivity and the fact that we can control the charge carrier concentration for optimized thermopower($\alpha$) and electrical conductivity($\sigma$) by controlling the dopant concentration. Thermal properties of pure amorphous thin films are also potentially useful in micro- or nano fabrication techniquessuch as electrically insulating integrated devices.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Mechanistic Importance of Redox Potentials and Conformational Flexibility in Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The mitochondrial matrix flavoproteins electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) are responsible for linking fatty acid Î²-oxidation with the main mitochondrial respiratory chain. Electrons derived from flavoprotein dehydrogenases are transferred sequentially through ETF and ETF-QO to ubiquinone and then into the respiratory chain via complex III. In this study, the effects of changes in ETF-QO redox potentials on its activity and the conformational flexibility of ETF were investigated.ETF-QO contains one [4Fe-4S]&lt;super&gt;2+,1+&lt;/super&gt; and one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). In the porcine protein, threonine 367 is hydrogen bonded to N1 and O2 of the flavin ring of the FAD.  The analogous site in Rhodobacter sphaeroides ETF-QO is asparagine 338. Mutations N338T and N338A were introduced into the &lt;italic&gt;R. sphaeroides&lt;/italic&gt; protein by site-directed mutagenesis to determine the impact of hydrogen bonding at this site on redox potentials and activity. FAD redox potentials were measured by potentiometric titration probed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The N338T and N338A mutations lowered the midpoint potentials, which resulted in a decrease in the quinone reductase activity and negligible impact on disproportionation of ETF&lt;sub&gt;1e-&lt;/sub&gt; catalyzed by ETF-QO.  These observations indicate that the FAD is involved in electron transfer to ubiquinone, but not in electron transfer from ETF to ETF-QO. Therefore it is proposed that the iron-sulfur cluster is the immediate acceptor from ETF.It has been proposed that the Î±II domain of ETF is mobile, allowing promiscuous interactions with structurally different partners. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) was used to measure the distance between spin labels at various sites and an enzymatically reduced FAD cofactor in Paracoccus denitrificans ETF. Two or three interspin distance distributions were observed for spin-labels in the Î±I (A43C) and Î²III (A111C) domains, but only one is observed for a label in the Î²II (A210C) domain. This suggests that the Î±II domain adopts several stable conformations which may correspond to a closed/inactive conformation and an open/active conformation. An additional mutation, E162A, was introduced to increase the mobility of the Î±II domain. The E162A mutation doubled the activity compared to wild-type and caused the distance distributions to become wider. The DEER method has the potential to characterize conformational changes in ETF that occur when it interacts with various redox partners.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Dropping out of school is associated with a wide array of negative outcomes and the extraordinarily high United States dropout rate has brought the issue to the forefront of American education.This study investigated normally collected middle school data from a suburban Colorado school district to determine the predictive value toward students dropping out or graduating from high school. Accessed was a longitudinal data set of first year in middle school records, 7th grade, from 1999-2003 for students that graduated or dropped out from a Colorado suburban high school from 2003-2007. Discriminate function analysis was utilized on 2,195 student school records, that included 106 dropout and 2,089 graduate student academic and demographic data, to determine the strength of the data to predict group membership.Middle school student&apos;s metamorphosis from child to adolescent is a uniquely critical time in a student&apos;s growth due to physical, social, psychological, and brain synaptic pruning. Dropping out of school is influenced by a wide array of external and internal school concerns but if clear set of red flags were available for easy identification of at risk students concerned school personal may best bring interventions to bear in the middle school setting. This study found that for this data set there was a slight correlation between grades in Language Arts and Math with a greater predictive power from Social Studies, Science, and Physical Education, subjects often overlooked in other studies. The conclusion stated that a clear set of warning signals was found with a strong enough probability of dropout identification to be considered as warning indicators and therefore all indicators need to be considered for every child on an individual level.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Narrowing of Curriculum: Teaching in an Age of Accountability</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Since No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation made clear the need for increased accountability of U.S. public schools in 2002, there has been a trend toward narrowing curriculum in social studies and other core subjects to focus predominantly on what is tested through state exams. Concerns exist regarding the unintended consequences of curriculum narrowing on low, middle and high socioeconomic status (SES) students in public schools.The Center on Education Policy (CEP) and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)  have been tracking the effects of NCLB since it took effect in 2002 and found that 71 percent of districts nationwide reported increasing instructional time for the tested subjects of reading, writing and math at the expense of other core subjects, especially social studies and science (Jennings, et.al 2006). Though the intention of NCLB has been to raise achievement, the results are less than promising (NCES, 2009; CEP, 2008; NAEP, 2007).This phenomenological study explores three teachers&apos; perceptions of curriculum narrowing, how these changes are impacting teachers, and teachers&apos; beliefs about their role and responsibilities in light of what is expected by districts in an era of increased accountability.Findings include teachers&apos; perceptions of lack of time as a major stressor to accomplish all that is required for raising achievement and to meet the standards with students. The district mandated focus of instruction was found to be on tested subjects of reading, writing, math and recently science, while social studies was found to be marginalized--not receiving adequate instruction time or resources. P.E. and music were also found to be narrowed, while art had increased over time.A recurring theme was the stress experienced by teachers who are required to teach scripted curricula with the pressure to produce high achievement on state tests. Such curricula were not perceived to be meeting student needs or to be successful in raising student achievement in reading. Teachers thought teaching in integrated units would allow them to accomplish more instructional goals in the limited time they have with students. They also felt this approach made more sense for student learning of background knowledge and vocabulary essential to student academic success.Teachers subjected to scripted curricula and evaluation based on high-stakes testing did not feel trusted and experienced a great deal of stress related to following district directives when they did not coincide with teacher beliefs regarding their role as teachers. They understood the need for scripted programming only to support new teachers in hopes of retaining them in the profession.Overall, the greatest negative impact was found to be on the social studies which have lost importance in these schools. This marginalization left teachers feeling conflicted, as their stated goal of education was to educate students who would become good citizens.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Navigating Through U.S.-China Policy: An Investigation of China National Off-Shore Oil Corporation&apos;s Proposed Acquisition of Unocal Corporation and How Domestic Politics Plays a Role in Balancing U.S. Trade Policy with National Security Policy</dc:title>

  <dc:description>When Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation, Ltd. ( CNOOC) attempted to buy American-owned Unocal Corporation, it unleashed a &quot;perfect storm&quot; in Washington.  Members of Congress immediately called upon President Bush to invoke his Exon-Florio authority to prevent the transaction.  After the president claimed action would be premature, Congress quickly coalesced to block the deal.  The Chinese expressed surprise at the political backlash and ultimately CNOOC was forced to withdraw its bid.The purpose of this study is to explain the fervor that arose over CNOOC&apos;s proposed acquisition of Unocal.  The study builds upon the theoretical approach of new institutionalism which emerged in response to the shortcomings of theories that diminished the importance of political values and collective choice in foreign policy making.  Since institutionalism emphasizes the significance of history and assumes the infusion of societal values over time, the study applies historical research methodology to the case study.  Sources of data include the U.S. Constitution, statutes, judicial opinions, congressional hearings and reports, White House papers, administrative rules, and published biographies.  Secondary sources include the media, journals, and think-tank publications.The study examines how the president and Congress rely upon formal rules for making policy, and how these rules reinforce the status quo and create obstacles for change.  Over the years, the president has acquired greater foreign policy making authority which has upset the balance of power between the two decision-making bodies.  Since policy making is incremental, members of Congress have needed to be resourceful in devising informal mechanisms for change.  One such mechanism is politicization of an event to raise public awareness, elevate an issue to the top of the policy agenda, and build coalitions essential to passing legislation.The research finds that competition between the president and Congress over foreign and national security policy authority is played out in Washington and is reflected in policy outcomes.  In the Unocal acquisition case, politicization allowed members of Congress to advance their agenda to tighten up the president&apos;s process for reviewing foreign acquisitions and to give Congress greater oversight authority.This study is important and timely because China has become a major player in the global economy and is driving the global search for new and reliable sources of energy.  As China extends its reach, competition with the U.S. and other major energy importers will increase.  Although competition is considered essential for a healthy capitalist economy, other factors influence whether competition will have a positive or negative impact on competitors.  One of these factors is the perception of how China&apos;s emergence in the global economy will affect U.S. national security.  The future of U.S.-China relations will depend upon the ability of our political institutions to achieve balance and compromise in energy, foreign trade, and national security policies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease often characterized at the time of diagnosis by resting tremor, rigidity, and/or bradykinesia. Over the course of the disease, motor functioning, cognitive functioning, and quality of life typically decline as the effectiveness of drug therapies diminishes. This study utilized medical, neuropsychological and quality of life data that were collected as part of a double-blind placebo surgery trial in which 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive bilateral transplantation of embryonic mesencephalic dopamine cells into the putamen or sham surgery. Nineteen women and 21 men participated in the study. Analyses focused on relationships between neuropsychological, motor, and quality of life data at baseline, 12, and 24 months post-surgery. Other analyses investigated differences between older (61+) and younger (&lt; 60) patients in regard to neuropsychological functioning, as well as neuropsychological differences between those who thought they received the transplant and those who thought they received sham surgery at 12 months.Results of this study indicated that a measure of verbal fluency and two measures of visual memory correlated most consistently with measures of motor functioning and quality of life. Depression was related to lower scores on neuropsychological assessments at 12 months and perceived support was related to higher neuropsychological scores at 24 months. Other results indicated that younger participants obtained higher scores on measures of verbal fluency and verbal memory than older participants. Finally, there were no differences between those who thought they received the transplant and those who thought they received the sham surgery before the double-blind was lifted at 12 months in regard to neuropsychological performance. Thus, the placebo effect, which was apparent in previous medical and quality of life analyses using these data, did not extend to neuropsychological test performance.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In June of 2006, Urban School District appointed the individual who is the focus of this study, a retired Air Force Two Star Major General, as its new superintendent.  Although the appointment represents the first nontraditional superintendent to lead Urban School District, it was one of several such appointments to large, urban school districts throughout the nation.  This study investigates his transition from military leader to urban school superintendent, using a case study approach.The study presents findings in response to the research question: How did the Participant transition from military leadership to urban school superintendent?  The findings of the research indicate the Participant transitioned from retired military to public school superintendent by way of the extensive leadership training detailed by Benton (2005) in the United States Air Force Officer&apos;s Guide regarding the personal character of military officers. The personal character traits include flexibility, humility, and empathy. The development of the Participant&apos;s personal character was exemplified by a successful experience as a career officer in the Air Force. The Participant was able to transition from military to public school superintendent through personal integrity, flexibility and other character traits supported by leadership skills applicable in any organization. The study also proposes consideration of a 21st century education model of leadership as defined by the military model of leadership. Education leaders of the 21st century would be defined by the mission to educate children and would demonstrate the emotional intelligence enabling them to manage systems and lead people to successfully accomplish the mission. A further adaptation of the military model of leadership to consider would be a biannual rotation of principal interns or principals to various education settings so as to develop and strengthen leadership characteristics such as political awareness and flexibility.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The main goal of this project was to develop an efficient methodology allowing rapid access to structurally diverse scaffolds decorated with various functional groups.Initially, we discovered and subsequently developed an experimentally straightforward, high-yielding photoinduced conversion of readily accessible diverse starting materials into polycyclic aldehydes and their (hemi)acetals decorated by various pendants. The two step sequence, involving the &lt;italic&gt;Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; addition of heterocyclic chalcones and other benzoyl ethylenes to a variety of dienes, followed by the &lt;italic&gt;PaternÃ²-BÃ¼chi&lt;/italic&gt; reaction, was described as an alkene-carbonyl oxametathesis. This methodology offers a rapid increase in molecular complexity and diversity of the target scaffolds.To develop this novel methodology further and explore its generality, we directed our attention to the &lt;italic&gt;Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; adducts based on various chromones. We discovered that the &lt;italic&gt;Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; adducts of chromones are capable of photoinduced alkene-arene [2+2] cycloaddition producing different dienes, which can either dimerize or be introduced into a double-tandem [4Ï+2Ï]Â·[2Ï+2Ï]Â·[4Ï+2Ï]Â·[2Ï+2Ï] synthetic sequence, followed by an acid-catalyzed oxametathesis, leading to a rapid expansion of molecular complexity over a few experimentally simple steps.In view of the fact that oxametathesis previously was primarily observed in aromatic oxetanes, we decided to prepare model aliphatic oxetanes with a conformationally unconstrained or &quot;flexible&quot; methyl group based on the &lt;italic&gt;Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; adducts of cyclohexadiene or cyclopentadiene with methyl vinyl ketone. Upon addition of an acid, the expected oxametathesis occurred with results similar to those observed in the aromatic series proving the generality of this approach. Also we synthesized polycyclic oxetanes resulting from the &lt;italic&gt;Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; adducts of cyclic ketones. This not only gave us access to remarkably strained oxetane systems, but also the mechanism for their protolytic ring opening provided a great deal of insight to how the strain affects the reactivity.Additionally, we discovered that although the model &lt;italic&gt;Hetero-Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; adducts did not undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, both &lt;italic&gt;exo-&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;endo-Sulfa-Diels-Alder&lt;/italic&gt; products, nonetheless, were photochemically active and various products with defined stereochemistry could be produced upon photolysis.In conclusion, we have developed an approach to the encoding and screening of solution phase libraries based on the photorelease of externally sensitized photolabile tags. The encoding tags can be released into solution only when a binding event occurs between the ligand and the receptor, equipped with an electron transfer sensitizer. The released tags are analyzed in solution revealing the identity of the lead ligand or narrowing the range of potential leads.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A qualitative research highlights how parent driven &quot;communities of support&quot; create lasting change in schools and communities, through the unique blend of the two methodologies, oral history and educational criticism and connoisseurship. In recent years, schools and communities are unusually impacted by an escalating wave in the diagnosis and treatment of persons with Autism.  In 2010, the Center for Disease Control&apos;s Report stated 1 in 110 U.S. children are diagnosed with Autism. Yet long before this official report, parents and professionals affected by Autism and other disabilities were busy during the last half of the 20th century, seeking out ways to treat, cure and increase the quality of the children&apos;s lives. They were part of the disability advocacy movement that forged legislation in special education, pre-school early identification/education and pioneering therapeutic treatments.Among these pioneering early groups in the Autism community, are the parents and professionals who founded FEAT (Families for Early Autism Treatment), in 1994. Their intent was to promote high quality school programs and services for children with Autism. Their creative efforts serve as a model for parents of children with disabilities everywhere. Through perseverance and concerted action, they channeled their personal loss and grief into a positive force, creating a community of support advocating for change in their schools and community.This research discovers valuable information about parent organization efforts, perspectives of FEAT&apos;s strategies, along with practical applications for a model which may be useful for other parent organizations seeking to change their schools and communities.A hybrid research methodology was implemented. Building on the qualitative design of oral history; this research records and interprets living disability rights history. Utilizing Eisner&apos;s educational criticism and connoisseurship, it also illuminates research results with an enlightened pen, through poetic representation. These two qualitative methodologies, oral history and educational criticism and connoisseurship, guide the data collection, analysis, interpretation, and literary presentation of this research.  The parents and professionals, as the five founders of FEAT were interviewed three times and tape-recorded. The tapes were transcribed, studied, analyzed and poetic representations of their personal insights were written and displayed.Answers to the research questions were gleaned through analysis, highlighting the founders&apos; challenges, resources, the impact of their efforts, and a detailed list of recommendations for other parents, community leaders and educators.Through the technique of educational criticism and connoisseurship, research findings were further analyzed. The themes emerging from this study are: direction for advocacy, building for change and impact of legacy. The founders&apos; insights and perspectives of their life experiences provided study implications focusing on the autism related issues of urgency, advocacy, effective treatment, public awareness, research, policy planning and communities of support. Resulting recommendations hold significance for those who work with and advocate for persons with autism and/or for those who make policies that guide autism research, services and programs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current research investigated the relationship of phonological memory (PM) to vocabulary and syntax learning in school-age children with and without language disorders.  Previous research has established that PM and broad oral language skills covary, but disagreement remains about the reason for this association.  Opposing theoretical viewpoints emphasize the importance of either bottom-up (PM influences vocabulary and syntax acquisition) or top-down (vocabulary growth influences PM skill) factors.  In three longitudinal studies, we tested competing bottom-up and top-down explanations of the PM-broad language link.  Study 1 utilized a structural equation modeling approach to understand PM and broad language relations from age 5 to age 8 in population samples from three cultures.  Final models varied by culture, with overall results supporting bidirectional relations between PM and vocabulary or syntax.  Study 2 used a similar approach to investigate PM and broad language development in children with phonologically-based language disorders: speech sound disorder and reading disability.  Results supported a bottom-up account in children with more substantial language delays and a bidirectional account in more mildly affected children.  Study 3 used a behavior genetics approach to test for shared etiology of PM and vocabulary deficits in 5- to 8-year-old twins.  We found evidence for common influences on PM and vocabulary weaknesses both within and across time.  The bottom-up effect appeared to be predominantly influenced by shared genes, while the top-down affect appeared to be predominantly influenced by shared environmental experiences.  Across the studies, methodological limitations prevented strong conclusions about the relation between PM and syntax.  However, a clear pattern emerged concerning PM and vocabulary knowledge.  The relationship of PM to vocabulary in the early school years owes to both bottom-up and top-down factors, with both effects undergoing developmental changes during this age period.  We argue that the bottom-up effect gradually wanes with language development, while the top-down effect emerges as a consequence of learning to read.  Future studies to further test these conclusions are proposed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this investigation was to examine pragmatic language engagement and social competence in middle school children with and without reading disability during dyadic interaction. Engagement was defined in terms of degree of information and responsiveness provided by each partner. Analyses indicated reading disabled students differ from non-reading disabled students in terms of pragmatic language engagement. However, this was true only in terms of degree of responsiveness. Students with reading disability employed similar degrees of pragmatic language engagement in terms of information to those of their non-disabled peers. Further, no relationships were found between social competence and either type of pragmatic language engagement, responsiveness or information. Implications for the multifaceted assessment of pragmatic language and social competence and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Primacy of Conscience: A Pastoral Theological Construction of Agency for Catholic Moral Decision-Making</dc:title>

  <dc:description>A significant pastoral problem for some Catholics flows from the dissonance they experience when attempting to integrate certain Church teachings with the leading of their conscience as they make moral decisions.  All Catholics do not accept every established moral answer or position provided by the Church and integrating those differences between the Church teaching and one&apos;s conscience can be difficult--a difficulty affecting parishioner, priest, and Church.  This problem is, in part, rooted in and reinforced by the fact that there are two theological strands in the Church&apos;s tradition regarding morality.  One strand suggests that the moral response is to obey normative Church moral teachings, whereas the other strand suggests that the moral response is to follow your conscience which is informed by Church teaching.  The pastoral problem of understanding and exercising conscience while striving to be informed by and responsible to normative Church teachings is at the heart of this research in order to ameliorate the polarization and division that is currently present in this arena.One of the unstated assumptions and/or insufficiently developed concepts within the primacy of conscience debate between obedience to tradition and following individual conscience is the status of agency as it relates to primacy.  The principal thrust of this study of primacy of conscience is that agency is a critical element in understanding the meaning and function of primacy of conscience within the relationship between the social group (as reflected in the terms tradition and teaching) and the individual (as reflected in the term primacy of conscience)--an agency that is interdependent and at times in conflict.  This pastoral theological study employs Larry Graham&apos;s psychosystemic approach to pastoral theology as it expands the conversation by identifying the pastoral problem of primacy of conscience and the role of agency from a pastoral theological methodology that examines relevant personal and pastoral experience, historical antecedents to the problem, and appropriate conceptual theological and secular resources.As this study reviews the long and varied history of conscience in the Catholic tradition as illustrated in several critical historical moments, it identifies the problematic character of the two strands within the tradition and reveals the importance of a more developed understanding of agency in light of the tradition&apos;s inherent ambiguity.  By integrating Albert Bandura&apos;s systemic Social Cognitive Theory, this study offers an enhanced understanding of agency from a disciplined behavioral scientific perspective on the social-personal interfaces involved in decision-making in general (i.e., self-reflectiveness, perceived self-efficacy, and social persuasion) which apply to moral concerns and, consequently, amplifies an understanding of primacy of conscience that can inform priestly counsel to Catholics seeking moral guidance.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the spring of 2008, Dwight Jones, Commissioner of the Colorado Department of Education, invited six Colorado school districts to partner with the department and an outside provider to close their achievement gaps in reading and math between minority and poverty students and White students and non-poverty students. Districts were invited to partner based on an achievement gap that exceeded the state&apos;s average gap in reading and math, and its perceived leadership capacity to initiate change.This study examined the process the six districts used to select a provider to assist in closing its achievement gap. The multi-case study analyzed the districts&apos; processes for selecting a provider using interviews and a review of documents obtained from the Colorado Department of Education.Results from this study concluded: there was little difference in the process districts used to select its provider; individual and district experiences working with providers influenced the district&apos;s choice of a provider; providers selected had to be a &quot;fit&quot; for the district; provider self-reporting did influence the choice of a provider, however, not all categories of self-reporting were as important as others in the selection of a provider; and there was a significant variation in the number of stakeholders the district involved in the final selection of the provider.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Reading religious literature is generally considered to be either an &quot;outsider&apos;s&quot; practice useful for the determination of a culture&apos;s or individual reader&apos;s beliefs, whether of the past or present, or an &quot;insider&apos;s&quot; practice necessary for guidance in morality and &quot;right&quot; action.  Both of these practices mean the text is construed as the motivation or cause of other beliefs and actions, and that the purpose or value of such texts is nothing more than identifying and promulgating certain beliefs.  Understanding texts and reading in this way does not allow us to conceive of the text as a work of art and perceive the reader&apos;s own self-structuring through engaging this art.  An alternative notion of reading can help us to conceive of the self as a work of art whose growth depends on encountering and engaging another&apos;s artistry, in this case, the religious text.  Through the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, and to a lesser degree that of Jean-Paul Sartre, this dissertation proposes reading itself to be an imaginative process that illuminates the self and its relationship with others.  As part of that imaginative activity, the concepts of truth and the self are also re-thought and dislocated from the subject-object framework that dominates much of contemporary thinking.  The practice of reading is therefore best seen not as a search for truths or beliefs &quot;embedded&quot; in the text, but a communication with others that proves the self to be in a constant state of becoming, an artistic process most human in its resistance to perfectability.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study implemented and evaluated an adapted version of the Within Our Reach program called FRAME. Participants were 173 low-income couples in committed relationships and caring for at least one child together. Participating couples were randomly assigned to one of the four study conditions (couples group, female group, male group, or control group). The impact of the program was investigated on a range of relationship and mental health outcomes. The present findings suggest that the FRAME workshop was helpful in reducing negative communication and improving positive bonding for our sample. Couples were able to benefit in some areas when only one partner attended the workshop. Overall the FRAME project was viewed as helpful and was well received by both male and female participants from various ethnic backgrounds. Associations between key variables were also examined and the results highlighted the negative impact of economic strain on individual and relationship functioning for men and women. Implications for future relationship education programs and research with low-income and ethnically diverse populations are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Two purposes guided this concurrent nested mixed methods research.  It examined and described the processes followed and experiences had by the administrators, teachers, and specialists involved in designing and implementing a new Response to Intervention (RtI) model at an elementary and examined the effectiveness of the RtI model on raising achievement scores in reading after its first year of implementation.Qualitative findings revealed two challenges encountered by district level personnel.  First, administrators felt pressured to put RtI into effect quickly due to the needs of students in the district and new educational policies mandating immediate changes to long-standing practices.  Second, logistical obstacles to implementation arose, including scheduling and credits earned towards graduation of secondary students.  While the new RtI model presented difficult challenges, district level administrators felt successful having met the district goals for the year and perceived growth on standardized tests.This dissertation described the design and implementation of the RtI at Foothill Elementary School.  Foothill went above and beyond the goals set by the district by designing and implementing a Standard Treatment Protocol to complement services provided by the Problem Solving Team at the school.Participants faced two major challenges during the first year of RtI implementation: structural aspects of the RtI model impeded effective communication and the rigid school schedule presented logistical challenges impeding student services provided. However, participants agreed the model was successful, met the needs of students, and credited its success to the strength of the school staff and leadership.Quantitative analyses examined the growth rates of students receiving intervention versus students in comparison groups.  Four regression discontinuity analyses were conducted:  (1) growth of first grade students on the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS); (2) growth of second and third grade students on the PALS assessments; (3) growth of third through sixth grade students on the Measure of Academic Progress (MAP); and (4) growth of fourth through sixth grade students on the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP).Results revealed the presence of a statistically significant treatment effect in favor of students in the intervention groups on the spring 2009 Colorado Student Assessment Program only.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Risk and Protective Factors Associated with Academic Achievement among Ghanaian Youth</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Young people in Ghana who grow up in poverty and to families with little or no education endure limited early learning opportunities, underfunded educational systems, and more health and mental health problems compared to their peers from more privileged backgrounds. A significant body of literature addressing the relationship among risk, protection, resilience and academic achievement is based on youth populations in North America and Western Europe. Relatively little is known about the applicability of ecological and risk and resilience frameworks in non-Western countries. Consequently, educational outcomes of young people in Ghana are often characterized by similarities in low achievement, lack of teachers, school supplies, and dilapidated school buildings. Such characterizations mask internal and social resources of individuals in Ghana. In an attempt to understand the processes of students&apos; academic achievement in Ghana, this study examined the relationship among risk, protection, and academic achievement of 276 first-year college students in Ghana. Using a mixed methods design, the study applied ecological theory and the risk and resilience framework to measure personal, family, and environmental conditions that enhanced or inhibited achievement. Bivariate analyses revealed gender and regional differences in measures of protection and risk relative to school achievement. These included parental and individual drug abuse, neighborhood safety, school mentor, neighborhood cohesion, collective efficacy, and parental educational values. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed significant relationships between students&apos; grades and sense of optimism, region of residence, presence of a school mentor, parental social support, and neighborhood safety. Results suggest that there are important gender and regional differences in Ghanaian youths&apos; access and exposure to systems of support and risks. Implications of these findings, limitations of the study design, and directions for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>What explains the resilience of authoritarian regimes in the face of regular competitive elections that ostensibly should promote democratic transitions?  This dissertation examines both why and how parliamentary elections in Jordan and Morocco have served to reinforce these two Arab monarchies. In doing so, it develops a framework in which the degree of cohesion among incumbent and opposition elites shape electoral system design and, in turn, particular electoral rules structure mass political attitudes and elite configurations.  The main argument is that lower electoral thresholds generate unique electoral environments in which patronage politics thrive and opposition-based politics falter, thus producing a decidedly uneven playing field.  In the end, this study examines four additional case studies from the Arab world in order to construct a typological theory about the conditions under which elections reinforce or undermine regime stability and then discusses the policy implications for democracy assistance programs.  This project is grounded within the classic and contemporary literature on the role of elites in democratic transitions, the design and functioning of electoral systems and the relationship between elections and authoritarianism. The research design is based on a comparison of &quot;most similar&quot; cases and utilizes a &quot;mixed method&quot; approach that draws from qualitative and quantitative data.  The empirical analysis, which focuses on the 2007 parliamentary elections in Jordan and Morocco, is derived from intensive fieldwork in both countries.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>While dominant national P-20 narratives circulate a discourse of the near achievement of racial equity post Brown v. Board of Education, there remains a large gap between the experiences of people of color and the official record of their inclusion and access. Organizational self-analysis of racial disparities in education often attribute undeniable discrimination to the micro-level performances of individuals; claiming micro-aggressions, lack of training, political/personal conflict, or ignorance. When these reasons cannot fully explain gross inequity; organizations turn to society&apos;s socio-economic disparities and mirrored racial realities within the country as instructive on the inevitable realities of racism within schools.A critically missing piece in the binary of this micro/macro analysis is the role of accountability that the culture of organizations have in reprising and maintaining structural elements of discrimination that make certain an outcome of inequality in education. This counter narrative argues that the nature of race based and other institutional discriminations has changed. Now covert, culturally normalized and widely sanctioned, these forms of institutionalized oppressions through its invisible form, have gained propulsion. It&apos;s largely undisrupted ascendancy within institutional life hides in the shadows of culture, actively works to deny marginalized people&apos;s full expression of their humanity, and work&apos;s against their actualization of freedom.Working to make visible the ethereal constitution of institutional covert discrimination; the voice of this study through literary device attends to the intimate nature of this closed dialogic space, effectively opening up spaces for silenced stories that serve to intimately and graphically expose this phenomenon.This research conducts itself as critical indigenous inquiry. Epistemologically working from an Afro-Mexican diasporic position; the author/participant asks readers to make metaphorical leaps from the experience of the individual to a more scopic experience of oppressed people. Piercing the veil of whiteness and more traditional to African relational ways of knowing; story is used to ground the reader in the everyday experiences of witnesses who testify to the existence, operation and effect of institutional covert discrimination while strategically integrating instructive theories operating sub- textually.This work draws on P-20 education as a historically and contemporarily important location to phenomenologically interrogate institutional covert discrimination (ICD). Its broader claim is that ICD is not solely germane to education; rather it is a disease afflicting large sectors of organizational life.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The job of public school principal can feel overwhelming and frustrating. Principals are faced with ensuring their school is meeting the academic achievement needs of students along with the social, emotional, and physical needs of students, particularly if they are serving in high poverty, high needs schools.  Most principals question, at least once in their career, whether to stay in the position. While some stay, many more leave the position especially if they are at a high needs school. This study was interested in principals serving, and staying, in difficult or diverse elementary schools. Knowing the emotional toll that the principalship takes, this researcher was interested in how spirituality plays a part in principals&apos; professional lives.The purpose of this grounded-theory study was to investigate public school principals in difficult or diverse elementary settings and then generate a theory or framework that explained what role spirituality plays in school leaders&apos; professional lives. This study sampled public elementary school principals from the Northern Metropolitan Denver area. Using classic grounded theory methodology, interviews were conducted, and the data analyzed with constant comparative analysis which included coding, memoing, sorting, and theoretical sampling.This study generated a theory that is grounded in the categories that were discovered during the investigation. A theoretical framework of spiritual school leadership was generated from the categories of soul work, wholeness, moral authority, transformative leadership, and connector. A major finding of the study is that the theory is process driven. School leaders are spiritual leaders who progress through a series of stages as their career matures. They initially have soul work as their core, then progress through the other generated categories until they are connectors. Spiritual school leaders progress along this path and through the categories and back through the categories as necessary. There is an inside-out process to spiritual school leadership. Spiritual school leaders resolve the leadership challenge of being a school leader that makes a significant difference in the lives of all kids, while managing all the complexities and concerns of a principal&apos;s professional life.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this dissertation, we consider notions of equivalence between minimal Cantor systems, in particular strong orbit equivalence. By constructing the systems, we show that there exist two nonisomorphic substitution systems that are both Kakutani equivalent and strongly orbit equivalent. We go on to define a metric on a strong orbit equivalence class of minimal Cantor systems and prove several properties about the metric space. If the strong orbit equivalence class contains a finite rank system, we show that the set of finite rank systems is residual in the metric space. The last result shown is that set of systems with zero entropy is residual in the strong orbit equivalence class of any minimal Cantor system.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Student Engagement Differences By Ethnicity And Scale For Ninth Grade Students</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Differences on three domains of student engagement were compared across ethnic groups and by sub-scale. The ninth grade is often considered a vital juncture that indicates success or failure to graduate high school. When a student goes through a transition he or she often experiences some type of change in student engagement levels and may experience adverse effects in the form of academic, social, and psychological challenges. Researchers of the National Research Council (2004) believe that the engagement process (the successful interaction between the individual and the educational context) is considered a means toward alleviating unsuccessful student outcomes. Therefore, this study explored student engagement in three domains after a high school transition for Hispanic and White ninth grade students attending a small, rural high school.Student engagement was measured for each of three domains of engagement (behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, and cognitive engagement), treating engagement as a multidimensional construct, using the Student Engagement Survey (SES).Results from the data analyses indicated no statistically significant differences in levels of engagement on the SES across the three engagement sub-scales (behavioral, cognitive, and emotional) for a group of ninth grade students. Also, no significant differences were found between Hispanic and White students&apos; views of engagement.Results suggest that future research in which engagement components are present or not present or are being put into practice effectively versus ineffectively may allow researchers to understand the pathways between stratagem for changing the learning environment and the extent to which those changes will influence engagement and, ultimately, individual student success. The inclusion of other aspects of data could make available a broader scope of understanding into the positive and/or negative influences on student engagement.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Susceptibility Modeling and Mission Flight Route Optimization in a Low Threat, Combat Environment</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Movement and transportation systems are a primary topic in the study of humans and their relationship with the environment.  Only a few modes of transportation allow for nearly full freedom of movement that is unconstrained by rigid nodes and networks.  Individual human travel (walking, climbing, swimming, etc.) is one example while rotorcraft travel is another.  Although other criteria constrain movement, independence from a network allows for a unique examination of human spatial decision-making and choice behavior.  This research analyzes helicopter flight route planning in a low threat combat environment with respect to geography.  The particular problem addressed, which ultimately concerns the quantitative representation and mapping of helicopter susceptibility in a low threat, combat environment, is assisted by a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Prior susceptibility research on helicopters is combined with the spatial analytical functions of a GIS to cartographically model three dimensional flight corridors and routes across four separate areas.  GIS optimized flight routing plans that minimize helicopter susceptibility (maximize capability to avoid threats) are then compared to the conventional routes produced by human flight route planners using existing techniques.  Findings indicate that although the GIS routes reduce susceptibility costs, they concomitantly decrease route diversity.  There was no significant evidence that experience, expertise, landscape familiarity, age, or the amount of time taken to plan had any effect on the spatial character of the routes.  Several spatial similarities between conventionally planned routes and GIS optimized routes were revealed that expose potential perceptual limitations imposed by the conventional flight planning paradigm.  Implementation of geospatial technology could help eliminate these restrictions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study sought to determine teacher perceptions about the factors that influence support for an adequacy model of school funding and what relationship exists between specific demographic variables and those perceptions.Using the instrument created for the study, 139 teachers from the Montrose Re-1J School District were surveyed.  Data was tabulated using standard descriptive statistics.  As a general data analysis approach, bivariate comparisons were performed using Pearson correlations and t-tests for independent means.  Multiple regression prediction equations were used to examine the relationships between specific demographics and teacher perceptions of the factors that influence support for an adequacy model of school funding.The key findings were (a) teachers seemed to support the concept of adequacy but are less likely to support the concept when tradeoff issues are introduced; (b) teachers viewed the local level of government more positively than the state or federal levels; (c) teachers identified the state level of government as having the greatest ability to provide additional funding to districts with the neediest students; (d) teachers named the legislative branch of the government as best equipped to make funding decisions regarding the adequacy of school funding systems; (e) teachers with a more liberal political point of view were less affected by the concept of localism as a means of separation and were comfortable with judicial involvement in deciding issues of adequacy; (f) teachers who would be the most willing to share are those that teach at the elementary level, have earned a master&apos;s degree, do not own property in the district in which they teach, and have more liberal political views; and (g) with the fair distribution system factor, it can be predicted that those with higher household incomes and those with more liberal political views will be more supportive of an adequacy model of school funding.If the concept of school finance reform is conceptualized as a triangular interaction between the courts, the legislature, and the public, this study focused on the teacher as a member of the public by identifying teacher perceptions of factors that influence support for an adequacy model of school funding as well as identifying those teachers who might be the best candidates for grassroots advocacy groups that develop a greater capacity of understanding regarding funding issues, could agree on solutions, and could devise strategies for realizing the policy changes that benefit the neediest students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This research was designed to examine the implementation of a technology innovation in a content area from teachers&apos; points of view. Three classroom teachers who were involved in organized implementations of a technology innovation at the school level were asked to describe their implementations. They then were asked to review those implementations through four specific lenses that research indicates are important: school change, factors affecting implementation of technology innovations, technology in their content area, and examining their use of developers&apos; innovative improvements. Finally the classroom teachers were asked, as a summary technique, to talk about factors important to include in a written implementation plan.Teachers&apos; responses to questions in a flowing conversation were searched for common themes, and excerpts of those conversations were placed in a table to facilitate the analysis of the concepts and ideas the teachers were trying to convey. The common themes that teachers talked about were: the limited time in a teacher&apos;s day; implementing effective change in a classroom setting is a process that can take years; administrative support is secondary but important; professional development is critical and should be ongoing; technology in teaching and learning in the content area is essential; classroom practice improves because of technology implementation; and the innovative technology features used in the classroom depend on the content taught.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study describes the experiences of suburban area high school 10th, 11th, and 12th grade art students immersed in a cross-curricular study of the Holocaust and genocide. Three participant-educators, art teachers, and I, a history teacher, designed a two week curricular unit which was implemented in January, 2010, to increase student-participant awareness and action to address the global problem of genocide. This cross-curricular unit used non-discursive sources of testimony in a variety of forms of representation to inspire student-participant artwork.Four research questions guided this study: How do educators use a variety of forms of representation to teach the complexities of genocide? What were the experiences of student-participants and participant-educators engaged in this curriculum? What types of meaning can be gleaned about genocide education by employing a variety of forms of representation? What meanings can students demonstrate about genocide by using a variety of forms of representation?As the study was aesthetic in nature, I employed Elliot Eisner&apos;s Educational Connoisseurship and Criticism. I collected various forms of data including, field notes, formal and informal, group and individual, interviews, and artifacts including participant-student artwork and written reflections. Using aesthetic forms of testimony led to the student-participants making profound empathetic and emotional connections to the material. The participant-students and educators demonstrated a strong sense of community and trust which was difficult for me to penetrate as an outsider. However, students were empowered by the freedom to interpret a variety of meanings in a personal and engaging manner. They demonstrated an understanding of the complexities of genocide study as well as the antecedent actions of individuals and groups that can lead to genocidal events. The student-participants perceived their production of art as an act to prevent genocide by increasing awareness and action.Contributions of the study include the unique power of the arts to inform, recognition of the promises and struggles of interdisciplinary methods, and the value of instructional strategies, that include non-discursive sources of testimony, for Holocaust and genocide education.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>THE EXPANDING DEFINITION OF CRIME AND ITS EFFECT ON THE INDIVIDUAL: A MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSIS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Incarceration is one of the most extreme exercises of state power. For the past twenty-five years the rates at which states have been locking up their residents have been growing at a distressing pace. While violent crime rates have been declining, arrest rates for lower-level crimes have been steadily rising. Two new indices are developed to explain the relationship between lower-level crime and violent crime--the punitive severity index (PSI) and the punitive progression index (PPI). The PSI is the ratio of low-level crime to violent crime, a static indicator of punitiveness, while the PPI is a measure of the rate of growth towards or away from a more punitive approach to law enforcement. The PSI and probation rates are two important factors for predicting incarceration rates, explaining 98.6% of the variation in incarceration rates.Hierarchical modeling was used to test hypotheses about the influence of the PSI, the PPI, and other state-level contextual variables on sentence length. At the individual level, the model suggests the race of the inmate has some, though nonsignificant, influence on sentence length. At the state level, PPI is significant (p = .011) for predicting states&apos; average sentence length. Type of state probation system oversight, either judicial or executive, also significantly affected length of sentence, with judicial oversight associated with shorter periods of incarceration.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A review of the literature revealed that mothers with children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) face many challenges, including managing their child&apos;s behavior which is a defining characteristic of children with FXS (Epstein, Riley, &amp; Sobesky, 2002). Parents and professionals have become increasingly aware through research and everyday experiences that children with FXS are often overly sensitive to multiple stimuli (Hagerman, 1999; Hagerman &amp; Hagerman, 2002; Miller et al., 1999). This overstimulation often leads to behavioral challenges that are characterized by tantrums, angry outbursts, and other forms of aggression. Additionally, mothers of children with FXS have their own personal challenges that come with carrying the premutation of the FMR1 gene. Many factors associated with this maternal genetic status include a heightened risk for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), compromised self-concepts, and the possibility of giving birth to another child with FXS (Sherman, 2002). The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the expressed emotion of mothers of children with FXS and the behavioral and sensory characteristics of their children. Expressed Emotion is a construct of the familial emotional climate in which a parent (or close relative) expresses emotional involvement, hostility and/or criticism about their child (McCarty &amp; Weisz, 2002). The primary way to measure expressed emotion is the Five Minute Speech Sample (FMSS) (Magana-Amato, 1993) which is coded through a non-scripted monologue by one of the parents. Adapted from a longeriiiinterview process, the Camberwell Family Interview (CFI), FMSS is coded for content and tone of the parents&apos; speech sample for criticisms, emotional over-involvement, relationship status, and positive expressions (Wamboldt, O&apos;Connor, Wamboldt, Gavin, &amp; Klinnert, 2000). The FMSS provides a novel way of looking at the mother-child dyad in the FXS community and provide information to guide intervention for new mothers with young children with FXS. Without pathologizing the mothers of children with FXS, the findings of this study provides insight into the relationship between the expressed emotion of mothers and the behavioral and sensory characteristics of children with FXS that could lead to valuable intervention strategies developed by parents and professionals.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Large scale studies of the incidence and prevalence of psychological disorders have consistently shown that women meet full DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder at twice the rate of men (Kessler et al., 1994; Kessler et al., 2003; NCS-R, 2007; Robins &amp; Reiger, 1991). Some have proposed (Cochran &amp; Rabinowitz, 2000; Kilmartin, 2005; Pollack, 1998) that the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria do not adequately reflect the depressive symptoms of some men. Men tend to use more externalizing defenses and distracting coping styles to manage negative affect, and anger is hypothesized as an externalizing symptom of a masculine variation of major depressive disorder (Magovcevic &amp; Addis, 2008). The purpose of this study was to examine how adherence to masculine gender role norms and anger predict depressive symptoms in men. A multiple regression model was developed to examine the ability of trait anger, expressed anger, and adherence to traditional masculine role norms in predicting depressive symptoms in a sub-sample of male college students (n = 267). The regression model of masculine depression was found to moderately predict depressive symptoms. Trait anger also moderately predicted depressive symptoms in the male sub-sample. Although it was expected that specific masculine role norms (e.g. self-reliance and emotional restriction) would also relate to depressive symptoms, no masculine role norms were associated with male students&apos; endorsement of depressive symptoms. Additional clinical implications, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are addressed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Impact of Self-Efficacy, Commitment, and Coping on Occupational Strain in Non-Managerial, Non-Professional Employees</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The current study explored the effects of moderators, self-efficacy and commitment, and mediators, problem-focused coping (strategies used when changeable conditions exist, thereby resulting in the employee taking action [Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980]) and emotion-focused coping (perception that conditions are not changeable and emotions are regulated in a variety of ways versus taking action [Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980]), on predicting psychological and physical occupational strain in non-managerial, non-professional employees. Ninety-three shift workers in a 24/7 call center from one division of a transportation company located in the western United States participated in the study. The first research objective was to examine the individual contributions of self-efficacy, organizational commitment, and coping strategies on predicting levels of psychological and physical strain. The next objective was to understand how the combined contribution of moderators and mediators might predict strain outcomes. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore five hypotheses. Lastly, using correlation analyses the relationships between commitment and problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies were investigated. Important findings were revealed by the results of the study. Self-efficacy significantly predicted both strain outcomes with higher self-efficacy predicting lower psychological and physical strain. Organizational commitment and emotion-focused coping also significantly predicted strain. As organizational commitment increased, psychological and physical strain decreased. Increases in emotion-focused coping strategies predicted increases in both strain variables. Problem-focused coping strategies failed to reach significance in predicting psychological or physical strain. The combination of self-efficacy, commitment, and coping strategies significantly predicted both occupational strain outcomes. Finally, there was a significant, negative relationship between commitment and emotion-focused coping strategies. As commitment increased, emotion-focused coping decreased in this sample. The current study has extended empirical understanding of the individual and combined effects of self-efficacy, commitment, and coping strategies on psychological and physical strain in a population largely overlooked by the literature, non-managerial, non-professional employees. Additionally, the current study investigated organizational commitment using a unique population and in combination with other known moderators and mediators of strain.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The influence of the Reggio Emilia philosophy has been present in early childhood programs across the United States for decades, with many programs attempting to adapt the philosophy&apos;s concept of a studio, but few studies have examined them.  This study describes, interprets, and appraises two Reggio-inspired studios in the United States in order to provide an in-depth analysis and shed new light on such practices.Four questions guided this study: 1) What is the role of a studio in a Reggio-inspired school?  2) What is happening in the studio?  3) What are children learning in this environment? 4) How does the studio cultivate children&apos;s hundred languages?Based on the methods of educational connoisseurship and criticism, this investigation provides a vivid description and interpretation of preschool-aged children&apos;s experiences in Reggio-inspired studios.  Two sites were studied, one in Colorado and the other in Missouri.  Six dimensions of schooling provided the conceptual framework which guided this study: intentional, structural, curricular, pedagogical, evaluative, and aesthetic.  Similarities and differences between sites and art studios are examined and discussed, along with implications for the field of early childhood education.The overall findings that emerged reveal that Reggio-inspired studios have the potential to promote the following behaviors in children:  1) positive approaches to learning, 2) an ecological perspective, 3) creative thinking, 4) theory building, and 5) communication through many different languages.  The findings also suggest that Reggio-inspired studios help children learn that there are many ways to express their thinking, questions, feelings and ideas.  This occurs by children having access to a wealth of materials, the time to explore the materials, and the support to develop skills and techniques in the studio.  As a result, children learn to use materials as languages and create their own toolbox or repertoire of communication strategies that they can carry with them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The primary purpose of this study is to examine how Christian homeschooling works in Taiwan by investigating the intentions, implementation, challenges and implications of homeschooling practice. With regard to homeschooling as an increasingly popular educational option in Taiwan, particularly among Christian families, the following research questions are used to guide this study: (1) What are the reasons and goals of Christian parents in Taiwan to choose homeschooling for their children? (2)What does their homeschooling look like in practice? (3) What do the Christian homeschoolers perceive to be the advantages and challenges of homeschooling in Taiwan? (4) What are the implications of the Christian homeschooling movement for education in Taiwan?Based on the qualitative research method of Elliot Eisner&apos;s educational connoisseurship and criticism, this study presents a vivid description and analysis of Christian homeschooling experience in Taiwan. Four homeschooling families were studied: two in Taipei City and two in Hsinchu City. A conceptual framework incorporating six dimensions of schooling is used to guide the data collection; these dimensions include the intentional, the structural, the curricular, the pedagogical, the evaluative and the school-community relationship.In the homeschooling literature, a wide range of studies have been conducted to investigate homeschooling in the United States; however, only a few studies found are related to homeschooling in the East Asian contexts. Through this qualitative inquiry, it helps readers better understand how Christian homeschooling is practiced in Taiwan. Several important themes emerged from this study, including learning by homeschooling, family involvement, uncertainties about the future, and the combination of family, religion, and education in homeschooling, among others. Furthermore, this study indicates the challenges of homeschooling and discusses this educational choice as the road-less-taken in Taiwan.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Role of the Epistemic Community in Influencing Privacy Legislation:  The United State and The European Union</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Threats to individual privacy from computer information, database, and surveillance technologies of the mid-20th century prompted the formation of a privacy epistemic community that informed and influenced privacy policy and legislation in the United States and the European Union.  Because the United States was more advanced in computer technology than the European nations, awareness of privacy issues, and the privacy epistemic community, emerged first in the United States---and migrated to Europe a generation later.  The United States legislated the Privacy Act of 1974, which became the benchmark for individual privacy protection in the United States.  While several European nations passed privacy legislation in the 1970s, there was no common privacy policy and law among European nations.  In the early 1970s, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) created privacy data-protection committees that became important networking organizations for privacy epistemic community experts from the United States, European nations, and other OECD member nations.  The influence of the trans-Atlantic privacy data-protection epistemic community can be seen in the similarities among the Fair Information Principles/Practices (FIP) found in privacy studies, guidelines, conventions, and laws in the U.S., the CoE, the OECD, and the European nations.iiTwo case studies describe the role and influence of the privacy data-protection epistemic community members in influencing privacy studies, policy, and legislation in the United States and Europe.  The United States enacted narrow &quot;sectoral&quot; legislation to protect individual privacy from government computers and databases in the Privacy Act of 1974.  More than two decades later, the European Union enacted broad &quot;omnibus&quot; data-protection legislation that effectively limits the collection and aggregation of personal data on EU citizens.  Why two such dramatically different privacy data-protection laws could have been enacted when influenced by the same privacy data-protection epistemic community leads to analysis of economic, socio-cultural, and political influences on privacy data-protection legislation.  Evidence suggests that privacy data-protection epistemic community influence, filtered through different socio-cultural visions of the relationship of the government and the citizen, lead to dramatically different privacy data-protection legislative results.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using ambivalence as a theoretical framework, this study examines Ang Lee&apos;s cinematic discourse of Chinese identity, which is co-constructed with the audiences from different cultural communities. I focus on Ang Lee&apos;s transnational films Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Lust, Caution as my two case studies. By analyzing the audience discourse from Taiwan, Mainland China, and overseas Chinese communities, I am able to conceptualize their reactions as communicative moments that co-construct the meaning of the film text. I suggest that ambivalence is a self-representational strategy for the ethnic &quot;Other,&quot; who is historically denied access to representation, to contest and subvert the conventional stereotyping and simplification of one&apos;s subjectivity. Additionally, this research provides a good example of the familiar cycle of ambivalent emotion toward the West, in the aftermath of postcolonialism. China and Taiwan&apos;s long history of engaging in a subordinate relationship with the West enhances the resurgence of ambivalence. Representations become a significant and predominant way to mediate one&apos;s bodily experiences, to connect and collaborate with one another, and to form and inform one&apos;s cultural identity. My research furthers the theorization of the ways in which new media technologies impact and alter the human interactions between peoples from various cultural, social, and political contexts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Video and computer games have become an important area of study in the field of education. Games have been designed to teach mathematics, physics, raise social awareness, teach history and geography, and train soldiers in the military. Recent work has created computer games for teaching computer programming and understanding basic algorithms.We present an investigation where computer games are used to teach two fundamental computer science concepts: boolean expressions and recursion. The games are intended to teach the concepts and not how to implement them in a programming language.For this investigation, two computer games were created. One is designed to teach basic boolean expressions and operators and the other to teach fundamental concepts of recursion. We describe the design and implementation of both games.We evaluate the effectiveness of these games using before and after surveys. The surveys were designed to ascertain basic understanding, attitudes and beliefs regarding the concepts. The boolean game was evaluated with local high school students and students in a college level introductory computer science course. The recursion game was evaluated with students in a college level introductory computer science course.We present the analysis of the collected survey information for both games. This analysis shows a significant positive change in student attitude towards recursion and modest gains in student learning outcomes for both topics.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explored the personal journey of 11 White college administrators who were identified as inclusive leaders at a predominately White institution (PWI), recognized nationally for its work on partnering diversity and excellence. One overall question guided this study: How do White college administrators describe their journey to becoming successful inclusive leaders at a predominately White institution? This question was explored from the perspective of critical race theory (CRT), that is, inclusive leadership for White administrators could be achieved by intentionally examining their construction of Whiteness and their personal racial identity.Narrative inquiry was used to co-construct a developmental framework on inclusive leadership based on three face-to-face interviews and two group interviews;7 participants identified as female, 4 as male; 6 were senior-level administrators, and 5 were middle-level administrators. Findings were represented through narrative and fictional narrative. An inclusive leadership framework emerged that included three overarching categories of (a) four developmental phases, (b) four processes that contributed to the transition between the phases, and (c) transformative life experiences that influenced the personal growth between phases. Sub-phases on the construction of Whiteness and racial privilege emerged as part of each phase. Findings suggested that purposeful commitment to examining personal identities contributed to professional roles as inclusive leaders at a PWI.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Walking on the Red Brick Path: A Portrait of African-American Women&apos;s Experiences with the Built Environment of a Predominantly White Institution</dc:title>

  <dc:description>&quot;Space, like language, is socially constructed; and like the syntax of language, the spatial arrangements of our buildings and communities reflect and reinforce the nature of gender, race, and class relations in society&quot; (Weisman, 1992, p. 2). While institutions of higher education have granted physical access to African-American women over the last 150 years, their presence on American campuses has not been readily reflected in the physical design of the walls within which they learn. In examining the historical foundations of institutions of higher education, we cannot deny institutions consciously embed their values and basic assumptions within their physical manifestation (Bess &amp; Dee, 2008). The architectural design of a campus reflects its history as well as its future aspirations (Markus &amp; Cameron, 2002). In this way, the built educational environment has an important role in shaping and informing its community members of what education looks and feels like (Strange &amp; Banning, 2001). The message of predominantly white institutions still remains founded in the voice and values of those in power. Therefore, in order for African-American women to succeed in the academy, they have adapted their racial and gender identities to fit the predominant culture (Fordham, 1993).However, the hidden and unspoken messages that reflect the historical, social, and cultural context of American societal discrimination based on race and gender still remain in the built educational environment. In order to center the voices, experiences, and perceptions of African-American women within a predominantly white community, this study uses a critical black feminist lens. In addition, through an interdisciplinary conceptual model founded on the tenets of equal access federal policy, semiotics, organizational cultural transmission, and inclusive excellence, this study seeks to explore the dynamic that occurs between the built educational environment and its African-American female students. Utilizing the portraiture methodology, nine women participated in the study through cognitive tours, individual interviews, self-reflective journaling, and photo documentation. The findings of the study depict a portrait of African-American women&apos;s ability to reclaim the built educational environment of their predominantly white institution by physically and psychologically walking on its red brick path.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Hegemonically masculine concepts are frequently employed by decision-makers during times of crisis and war.  Language used by leaders is powerful in securing domestic support for US foreign policy decisions, and hegemonic masculinity shapes the ways in which leaders conceive of conflicts and in what ways those conflicts should be addressed.  Notions of hegemonic masculinity exert a powerful, structural influence on US Presidential foreign policy decisionmaking.The attacks of September 11th, 2001 changed United States foreign policy in fundamental ways.  This research examines the role of hegemonic masculinity in President George W. Bush&apos;s policy speeches, both how hegemonic masculinity may have shaped his language and how that language gave Bush the support he needed for unilateral intervention in Afghanistan.The research begins from a standpoint feminist perspective, and examines President George W. Bush&apos;s language in public speeches and statements released to the public on September 11, 2001 and in the six weeks following the attacks.  The research includes a narrative examination of Bush and how he understood international politics with regard to hegemonic masculinity, and a narrative of how Bush employed gendered language when speaking about the US intervention in Afghanistan.  The language used by President Bush is examined in detail, regarding his references to power, rescuer, and warrior in his speeches and statements before and after the 9/11 attacks.  Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were utilized to uncover how these three concepts were employed by President Bush before and after the terrorist attacks.President Bush relied heavily on conceptions of hegemonic masculinity in his language after September 11, 2001.  In particular, he used gendered ideologies and narratives to bolster the case for unilateral intervention in Afghanistan, employing notions of power, rescuer, and warrior.  Bush&apos;s use of the concepts of rescuer and warrior increased significantly after the terrorist attacks.  Bush, in effect, remasculinized the United States through a hypermasculine response.  These three concepts, power, rescuer, and warrior, were embraced by many Americans, and support for the US intervention in Afghanistan was overwhelming.  Language is powerful, and Bush&apos;s use of specific language which referenced hegemonic masculinity was an essential component in his arguments for US military intervention in Afghanistan.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Women Leaders Resolving Conflict in Higher Education: A Feminist Epistemological Perspective</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In an American postsecondary context, conflict is inherent (Gianneschi &amp; Yanagiura, 2006; Valian, 1999).  Successful navigation of conflict in the academy is vital for those who aspire to leadership positions (Nadler &amp; Nadler, 1987; Walters, Stuhlmacher, &amp; Meyer, 1998).  Presently, however, women face significant barriers to achieving success in higher education administration, including gender expectations for conflict resolution behavior (Bartunek, 1992; Bowles, Babcock, &amp; McGinn, 2005; Gayle, Preiss, &amp; Allen, 2002).While a considerable body of literature exists for understanding gender negotiation, it remains rooted in a masculine paradigm (Kolb &amp; Putnam, 2006; Shuter &amp; Turner, 1997), and, as such, established theories lack a feminist epistemological perspective.  Consequently, my primary research question is, How do women leaders experience and perceive conflict in the higher education work environment?  I conduct a qualitative study that examines workplace conflict experiences of 15 women leaders from diverse personal and professional backgrounds.Hartsock&apos;s (1983) three-tiered gender-sensitive analysis of power, updated to include multicultural perspectives, serves as my theoretical framework.  It is a lens through which I evaluate theories, finding multicultural organizational, higher education conflict, and gender negotiation theories most applicable to this study.  The framework also creates the foundation upon which I build my study.  Specifically, I determine that a feminist research method is most relevant to this investigation.To analyze data obtained through in depth interviews, I employ a highly structured form of grounded theory called dimensional analysis.  Based on my findings, I co-construct with study participants a Feminist Conflict Process Theory and Flowchart in which initially the nature of the relationship, and subsequently the level of risk to the relationship, institution, or self, is evaluated.This study supports that which is observed in the conflict resolution practitioner literature, but is unique in its observation of factors that influence decisions within a dynamic conflict resolution process.  My findings are significant to women who aspire to serve in leadership positions in higher education, as well as to the academy as a whole, for it expands our knowledge of women&apos;s ontological and epistemological perspectives on resolving conflict in postsecondary education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation addresses a complex cultural and social phenomenon: German multiculturalism in the framework of the European Union in the century of globalization and global migration. I use selected cinematographic works by Fatih Akin, currently the most celebrated German and European filmmaker, as cultural texts. This project illuminates cultural controversies, political complexities, and the discriminatory nature of German multiculturalism. Specifically, I show how and why the German society eagerly accepts and successfully integrates Italian immigrants, yet, culturally marginalizes and socially excludes the Turks. My work illuminates how complex historical and political processes of the past, guided by the principle of Euro-centricity, affect the multicultural dynamics in the German society. I also analyze Akin&apos;s positionality as filmmaker, political figure, and a poster-child of contemporary German and European cinema.This project invites critical re-consideration of the question of cultural diversity in Germany and in Europe and suggests transformative approaches towards multiculturalism. I use de-colonizing, critical cultural and critical feminist theories as well as art narrative with elements of performance ethnography for theoretical and methodological framework of my work. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute to the on-going scholarly, political and cultural research in the fields of multiculturalism, identity, and politics of inclusion.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive condition that affects the physical, emotional, and social functioning of individuals. Freed et al. (2001) conducted a double-blind sham-controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of fetal tissue transplantation for the treatment of advanced PD. The authors of that study examined the effects of the surgery across the dimensions of physical and neurological functioning. A quality of life (QoL) study was conducted to determine if there were differences in QoL when comparing those who received the fetal tissue transplantation with those who received the sham surgery (McRae et al., 2004).While there is little research on the effectiveness of fetal tissue transplantation as a treatment for PD, there is even less literature on longitudinal effects of this treatment. This study examined the longitudinal QoL among participants who received the fetal transplant surgery beginning in 1995. Participants included 11 people who were in the parent (Freed et al., 2001) and original QoL (McRae, 2004) studies. Participants completed several questionnaires that assessed many of the dimensions of QoL. Information from the questionnaires was compared to data collected before surgery, and at one and two years following surgery. Results indicated that Social functioning at baseline significantly predicted participants&apos; Physical functioning over ten years later</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since 1990, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has supported mixed-income redevelopment (MIR) strategies to address the problems of concentrated urban poverty neighborhoods with traditional public housing structures. This study focused on two neighborhoods in Denver, Colorado, with more than 38% of the residents living in poverty, which are facing transit-oriented MIR in the coming years. Residents in both neighborhoods have engaged in formal planning processes and community organizing as a way to be prepared for the change.The study posed three research questions: (1) what predicts a community&apos;s readiness for MIR, (2) what predicts resident involvement as community activists in neighborhood organizations, and (3) what are public housing residents&apos; responses to the evidence of previous HOPE VI project outcomes and their perspectives on what is needed for transition and relocation success. A mixed methods design was used that included a quasi-experimental survey of residents in the two neighborhoods (n=387), in-depth interviews (n= 25) of residents in one neighborhood where redevelopment is already underway, and the analysis of public artifacts and documents available during the study process. Residents participating in the survey were predominantly female (73%), Hispanic (44%) or African American (22%), and had incomes of less than $12,500 (76%). The majority of the sample resides in traditional public housing (66%), as well as those residing in redeveloped public housing (21%), low-income HUD subsidized apartments (11%), and neighboring houses (12%).Research question one found that readiness for transit-oriented MIR can be predicted with social cohesion, organizational collective efficacy, and having a transition and/or relocation plan. Research question two found that involvement in neighborhood organizations can be predicted by resident awareness of neighborhood problems, resident activism, and their perception of their community&apos;s capacity for change. Research question three found that residents facing a MIR move are already distressed, if they are going to move want to move up, and require multisystem support. The research addresses the HUD goal to build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination. Implications for social work practice include the need to include both clinical supports and community processes to help prepare residents for change.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This research project examined how forgiveness was managed by adult friends after relational transgressions. It studied how the emotion of empathy promoted the act of forgiving and why the construct of commitment related to trust and relational satisfaction among friendship dyads. Isolating the specific emotion empathy in regards to forgiveness heightened the understanding of what emotional behaviors were used to maintain friendships once a relational transgression was experienced. Measuring and analyzing the interaction between commitment, trust, and relational satisfaction helped to determine how these constructs promoted forgiveness among adult friends.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Study of Transient Variations in Cosmic Ray Proton Intensities Using BESS-Polar I Data</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The intensities of galactic cosmic rays are modulated upon entering the heliosphere. These variations, defined as solar modulations, are classified as long-term or transient modulations based on their durations.Studies have correlated the transient variations with the characteristics of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field. Therefore, studies of transients augment our understanding of physical processes in the interplanetary medium. Processes causing transient variations may also induce geomagnetic storms. Precise measurements of cosmic ray fluxes during a transient phenomenon will have immense use in validating models of space weather prediction.BESS (Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer), a US-Japanese collaborative program, directly measures light elements of cosmic rays in a large energy range (&amp;sim0.1 - several hundred GeV) thus bridging the gap between the low energy space-based and high energy ground-based experiments, has a large geometrical acceptance (0.3 m&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt; sr), and is highly sensitive in the lowest energy regime of cosmic rays where the solar modulations occur. BESS measurements can provide study of transient variations of cosmic ray protons and helium, for same energy but different rigidities (momentum per unit charge) or the same rigidity but different energies, as separate probes. BESS is sensitive to diurnal variations, unlike space based experiments.Proton fluxes from BESS-Polar I (flown from Williams Field, Antarctica, December 13-21, 2004), calculated for energies 0.1-100 GeV in time intervals as short as 4 hours, are analyzed for variations. Energy dependence of the observed variations is explored using smaller energy intervals. Neutron monitor data support our observations. To our knowledge, this is the first direct measurement of variations at the few-1% level by a balloon or satellite experiment at time scales of a few hours.Proton fluxes are presented in 4-hour averages, suitable for validation of solar wind and space weather prediction models. Suggested physical interpretations of the three observed features in the proton spectra, derived by comparison with the solar wind and IMF data from space-based experiments, include presence of a corotating interaction region or a magnetic cloud or a combination of both, a turbulent interaction region, and Compton-Getting anisotropy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Student achievement is not progressing on mathematics as measured by state, national, and international assessments. Much of the research points to mathematics curriculum and instruction as the root cause of student failure to achieve at levels comparable to other nations. Since mathematics is regarded as a gate keeper to many educational opportunities as well as, eventually, potential job prospects, critics are asking schools to fix the problem. This research project is a comparison of two different interventions used to improve student performance as tested on the Colorado State Assessment Program (CSAP). The first intervention, increased time-on-task, was used at Freedom High School for the school years 2004-2005 until 2008-2009. In those years, mathematics achievement did not improve and CSAP scores showed a negative trend. In the school year 2009-2010, Freedom High School used a computer-assisted instruction program as an intervention for low performing students. A matched-pair design was used to compare these two interventions to determine if the new intervention would improve student achievement.Eighth grade CSAP scale scores for both groups were used as a pre-test and ninth grade CSAP scale scores were used as a post-test. Pre-test mean scale scores were compared to determine variance between the groups. An analysis of covariance was used as a control for the mean differences. The statistical analysis showed that the computerassisted instructional program was ineffectual in improving student achievement in the sample group selected. Chapter Five offers discussion focused on the reasons why the computer-assisted instruction program did not work and possible solutions to correct the problems in the future. References are made to the fact that pedagogy must change if real achievement gains are going to be made by students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Class I (&lt;150 kg) autonomous helicopters are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of non-military applications such as, surveillance, reconnaissance, traffic monitoring, emergency response, agricultural spraying, and many other &quot;eye in the sky&quot; missions. However, an efficient landing/takeoff platform with refueling/recharging capabilities has not yet been developed to increase the endurance and decrease the cost for Class I helicopters.This dissertation presents a three-prong approach for increasing the range and endurance of Class I autonomous helicopters, which will then spur demand by non-military organizations wanting to take advantage of such capabilities and, therefore, drop their price.  The proposed Intelligent Self-Leveling and Nodal Docking System (ISLANDS) is developed as a mobile refueling/recharging station, which is one part of a three-pronged approach. ISLANDS is an electro-mechanical system that provides a safe landing surface for helicopters on gradients of up to 60%. ISLANDS operates &quot;off the grid&quot; and, therefore, must provide its own energy sources for the refueling/recharging tasks it performs. A method for determining ISLANDS&apos; energy needs for refueling/recharging of gas and/or electric helicopters for an arbitrary number of days is provided as the second part of the three-pronged approach. The final step for increasing autonomous helicopter endurance is a method for determining placement of ISLANDS nodes in the area to be serviced ensuring that the helicopters can achieve their mission goal.In this dissertation all aspects of the three-pronged approach are presented and explained in detail, providing experimental results that validate the proposed methods to solve each of the three problems. A case study using Commercially Off The Shelf (COTS) components that shows how all the parts of the proposed three-pronged solution work together for increasing the endurance of Class I helicopters is provided as a conclusion to the dissertation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, and to what extent, Conscientiousness, as part of the personality construct, and Self-Awareness, as part of the emotional intelligence construct, influence the occupational stress outcomes of absenteeism and burnout in culinary chefs. The research method and design selected for this study was a quantitative correlation and regression. The researcher selected the Self-Awareness factors from the ECI - 2.0, and the Conscientiousness factors from the NEO-FFI to measure the individual and interactive effect on absenteeism and burnout. The experience of burnout itself was measured the Maslach Burnout Inventory - GS, and absenteeism was measured by reported number of days absent from work. This study utilized an online survey of 66 questions, including 39 items based on these well-established measures in scholarly research and 27demographic items compiled by the researcher. Of the 213 restaurant chefs who were sent the survey, 70 responded rendering a return rate of 32.86%. The majority of the respondents were Caucasian males of an average age of 35. Nearly one-third of the sample was composed of Executive Chefs, while approximately 29 percent were Sous-Chefs. Another 14 percent were Chef Owners, and 13 percent were Junior Chefs. The vast majority (89 percent) worked at a free-standing restaurant. The findings of this study revealed that Conscientiousness significantly affect burnout in culinary chefs. No other tested variables correlated with statistical significance in this study. Several non-tested variables demonstrated significant correlations in the relationships between demographic data, Conscientiousness, and burnout primarily.This study contributes to the field by adding information for future research ideas, literature reviews, research design, and data collection and analysis when utilizing Conscientiousness, Self-Awareness, burnout and absenteeism in the study of occupational stress outcomes. Specifically, it addressed some important first step finding for understanding how certain personality factors and emotional intelligence factors might influence occupational stress outcomes in culinary chefs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A latin square of order n is an n by n array whose entries are drawn from an n-set of symbols such that each symbol appears precisely once in each row and column. A transversal of a latin square is a subset of cells that meets each row, column, and symbol precisely once.There are many open and difficult questions about the existence and prevalence of transversals. We undertake a systematic study of collections of cells that exhibit regularity properties similar to those of transversals and prove numerous theorems about their existence and structure. We hope that our results and methods will suggest new strategies for the study of transversals.The main topics we investigate are partial and weak transversals, weak orthogonal mates, integral weight functions on the cells of a latin square, applications of Alon&apos;s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz to latin squares, and complete mappings of finite loops.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Assessing the Success of Dual Use Programs: The Case of DARPA&apos;s Relationship with SEMATECH-Quiet Contributions to Success, Silenced Partner, or Both</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation investigates a major change in U.S. Government research and development policy away from its traditional mission-based model, toward a distinctly commercially-oriented research approach. The SEMATECH project is offered as an example of a Government Industry Partnership (GIP) dedicated to the development of dual-use programs (DUP) with the stated purpose of regaining technological superiority and market dominance in the production of a technology that had significant implications to national economic and military security.   The study, builds upon the previous research of Horrigan, 1996; Porter, 1990; Geisler, 1993, 1997, 2003; Fong, 2000; Harlen 2008, 2010; and Brown, 2010.  The study utilizes the process tracing methodology, and structured interviews to make some level of commentary concerning the effectiveness of the SEMATECH model and whether or not this model enabled the government and its primary sponsor, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to acquire any tangible technological benefits (equities) for the funds invested. This study also endeavors to ascertain under what conditions DARPA contributed to the success of this project, and if the government served a distinct and necessary purpose in advancing competitiveness.   The study presents unexpected findings concerning the government equities that should have emerged from SEMATECH.  The unexpected findings reveal that the government did not receive any tangible return on its investment in SEMATECH in part because it did, or could not focus its efforts on repeatedly emphasized government research agendas.  This inability to advance its research interest is a direct result of how SEMATECH was formed, and how it was funded.  In spite of the severe limitations associated with the U.S. government&apos;s abdication of direction setting prerogatives, DARPA still managed to make contributions that were necessary to the success of SEMATECH&apos;s commercial and competitive objectives.  Conclusions include indications that policy structured using SEMATECH as a model may not be the best model upon which to build future GIPs which focus on DUPs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&lt;italic&gt;Beyond This Point Are Monsters&lt;/italic&gt; is a creative work which establishes a fluid, unstable space between the mediated image and the written word. It addresses issues of repetition and difference in the TV melodrama and the inscribed surface of the house in the Gothic novel, performing the romantic and sensational tropes of the Gothic formula in order to subvert them. The project investigates and inhabits the soap opera &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; which aired daily on ABC from 1966 to 1971, and examines the manner in which the show defies its own genre conventions. I chose &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; as the foundational source for my text because it is a program which incessantly crosses its own boundaries. Conventionally, soap opera is a form of fictional realism, but the digressive concerns of &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; stray far from the everyday, while its necessarily fast production pace lacerates the program with constant failure and mistakes. &lt;italic&gt;Dark Shadows&lt;/italic&gt; is flawed, but in a way which troubles the rules of genre and the viewer&apos;s relationship to the screen. My investigation is manifested in the form of fictional writings and photographs which borrow the conceptual metaphors and visual gestures of the show. Each &quot;episode&quot; of &lt;italic&gt;Beyond This Point Are Monsters&lt;/italic&gt; mirrors a plot that is anterior to the show&apos;s own official plot, leaking language and images that are withheld and effaced in the original.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The dissertation is a creative prose project entitled &quot;Big City.&quot;  The book will be divided into four sections. It consists of sets of twelve vignettes with the same titles that are interspersed within their sections, as well as longer poetic prose pieces, and twelve short stories. The first section contains twelve vignettes, each under the title of &quot;People in the city are alone in their beds.&quot; People&apos;s lives are difficult to &quot;get going,&quot; so are books, and so are cities. The hope is that the voices will create a sense the necessary masses that are the city. The first section of the book also contains two longer pieces entitled &quot;A man in the city is writing a story on a bus&quot; and &quot;There are horses and lights in the city.&quot; These segments are intended to capture the movement that is possible in a big city, that is possible in language, as well as become those singular structures, or monuments, that set a city apart. Throughout the text movement of thought is reflected, and reflects back on, the organization of the text itself. The first section also includes vignettes entitled &quot;A woman in a city misses a man in another city.&quot; These vignettes are as close as the book comes to telling a cohesive plot driven story. There is a progression of story line through the thoughts of the &quot;woman&quot; that eventually ends the full cycle of the book. The woman misses a man she fell in love with after she spent one day with him in his city, and so wants him to visit her in her city. The next section is twelve short stories told in different forms, from third person omniscient to dialogue only. All the stories are located by the fact that the characters, or voices, involved live in a city. The third section contains three sets of twelve vignettes. The first twelve vignettes are entitled &quot;Things that can only happen in the city.&quot; There proper names are used tell little mini life stories and situations that can only occur in cities. The next twelve vignettes entitled &quot;There are all kinds of people in the city&quot; are used to explore race and diversity issues in dialogue and thought only.  And vignettes entitled &quot;Why is the city beautiful?&quot; set out to give different perspectives on what creates a sense of aesthetics in such an unnatural environment. The fourth section of the book is twelve longer vignettes entitled &quot;The other cities&quot; narrated in the same voice as the one used in &quot;A girl in the city misses a boy in another city.&quot; The texts ends when the &quot;woman&quot; has gone to the &quot;his&quot; city and to another unnamed city and has come back to her own alone still.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Career Pathway Experiences of Three Female School Superintendents: A Phenomenology</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Women represent 75 to 80 percent of the teachers across the U.S. (Glass, 1992), and the percentage of female superintendents is not in alignment with the female workforce.  Research indicates that the career pathways of male and female superintendents differ. While male superintendents often have a sequential pathway to a superintendency, women tend to take more of a labyrinth type of pathway resulting in a longer, indirect path to the superintendent position (Eagly and Carli 2007). This study examined the career pathways of female superintendents, and the support needed to increase gender equity for the superintendency. This dissertation examines the career pathways of three superintendents in a Southwestern state of the United States. Standpoint theory framed the identification of female superintendents as a phenomenon, and qualitative interviews elicited the voices of the female superintendents.The results of this study were somewhat surprising. The female superintendents had similar career pathways as male superintendents, had male mentors, were not intentional about the superintendency, and perceived themselves as innovative. The linear pathways of these female superintendents contradict earlier research, and their self identification as innovators gives them an identity that is focused around a need.  This research provides insight into how to support women in their pathways toward the superintendency.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Caring Work:  Opening a Space of Possibility for Exploring Transnational Feminist Solidarity between Privileged and Marginalized Women</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Neoliberalism, through its emphasis on personal responsibility and individual freedom in accelerating economic development globally, has only pushed women further into the margin of society. Structural adjustment programs (SAPs), which impose state budget cuts on healthcare and welfare programs, particularly have kept poor women and women of color in poverty and generally, have exploited women&apos;s labor. However, in this age of neoliberalism, women&apos;s solidarity becomes more significant. Because neoliberalism is founded on individualism, its downfall rests on alliance-building. Against this backdrop, I explore the possibility of fostering transnational feminist solidarity between privileged and marginalized women engaged in formal caring work. I have used narrative inquiry in conducting this study to find out whether the signifying practices of care may potentially organize women without ignoring their differences. I examine specifically the narratives of a Filipina caregiver and a Filipina care administrator in the Inland Empire. I argue that caring work opens a space of possibility for building transnational feminist alliances because it enables BeLonging, loving, and transformation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation explores the impact of colorism on Spanish Caribbean literature--more specifically, works of fiction and memoir by both island and diaspora writers from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Colorism, or discrimination based on the shading of skin, manifests itself in Spanish Caribbean literature in a variety of ways. It is often used as a marker of class and/or class difference; it may reflect and/or play a part in shaping cultural standards of beauty or attractiveness; and it signifies the entrenched complexities of the Spanish Caribbean&apos;s history of conquest and colonization. Colorism appears in these texts as both a carryover from Latin America&apos;s problematic histories with race (in terms of slavery and racial mixing) and as an indicator of the problematic constructions of race existing (in the past and present) both on these islands and in the United States. Race, constructions of race, and racism have all played a complex role in the histories of these island nations, and it seems only fitting to address as many of these histories as is possible.This project is divided into two major sections, one on the Dominican Republic and one on Puerto Rico, with a general and theoretical introduction that frames the work within Critical Race Theory and both Caribbean and Latino/a literary studies. The history of Spanish colonialism and a general denial and/or denigration of the African component to the ethnic heritage of these communities results in a construction of race based on a color-continuum model, rather than a binary model; this racial schema, along with Dominican and Puerto Rican concerns with whiteness, skin tone, and &quot;European&quot; phenotypic features, and their denial/denigration of an African heritage, shapes and influences the works of Dominican writers Julia Alvarez, Junot DÃ­az, Nelly Rosario, Angie Cruz, Loida Maritza PÃ©rez, and Annecy BÃ¡ez, and Puerto Rican writers Rosario FerrÃ©, Ana Lydia Vega, Mayra Santos-Febres, Esmeralda Santiago, Judith Ortiz Cofer, Piri Thomas, and Edgardo Vega YunquÃ©. The project concludes by drawing connections between Dominican and Puerto Rican experiences and supposing possible impacts of the growing Latino/a population on the racial and cultural makeup of the United States.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Community colleges in the United States serve a vital educational role in job training, preparation for transfer to a four-year institution, granting academic degrees and certificates as well as offering opportunities for personal growth and development.  Persistence has traditionally been measured by degree completion or by transfer rates.  However, students who enter community college with other goals may successfully meet their goal while not reaching traditional persistence milestones.  To date, much of the research on persistence has either focused on traditional students at four-year institutions, or on demographic risk factors among community college students.  Little has been done to evaluate the interrelationships between behavioral variables thought to influence community college student persistence.The purpose of this study was to use a national longitudinal dataset to evaluate a structural model integrating of the effects of behavioral variables associated with student motivation along with mediating factors that influenced community college students as they persisted toward their individual goals.  The initial goal was to establish a measurement model for the specified latent variables.  The second step involved an analysis of a structural model to establish relationships among the latent variables and endogenous variables.  The model was found to describe the community college student population of the BPS: 04/06 survey very well.Students&apos; combined cognitive ability, self-efficacy, and self-regulatory capacities do allow them to overcome external pull factors that have traditionally been shown to impede student persistence.  Students who have higher levels of cognitive abilities, self-efficacy, and self-regulation persist even though they may not feel integrated into the institution academically as indicated by faculty contact.  If a student is faced with the pull of outside employment and/or inadequate financial aid, is their capacity for self-regulation and their feelings of self-efficacy appear to enable the student to persist toward their goals.  The results of this study have shown that more than any other factor, motivation may indeed be the key to community college student persistence.  The results of this study serve to provide an alternative lens through which to view community college student persistence.   This viewpoint has not been extensively considered in the extant research literature up to this point.  The model presented in this study breaks from most traditional persistence models with the inclusion of psychosocial variables, and was found to be useful in identifying factors not commonly thought to be involved in student persistence.This study adds to the limited body of knowledge and addresses the gap in literature regarding differences in factors relating to persistence of community college students.  The findings should have important implications for research and instruction within the community college environment.  Such data could serve to reduce community college student attrition by: (1) aiding in the development of educational programs, (2) helping to develop institutional and public policy to sustain effective student support initiatives, and (3) target students, for whom specific policies should be developed to encourage persistence.  By considering how community college students&apos; needs and goals interact, federal, state, and college-level policy-makers might better consider how scarce resources may best be used to foster student success and persistence among the nation&apos;s fastest growing college sector.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>It has been projected that by 2020 one out of three children will originate from a culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) population (Rogers &amp; Lopez, 2002). Thus, school psychologists are called to reexamine and modify their service-delivery methods to better meet the needs of CLD populations (Guerrero &amp; Leung, 2008). The purposes of this study were: (1) to identify what a CLD problem-solving process looks like in the daily practices of school psychologists; (2) identify the impact of perceived value and skill level on the frequency of implementation practices of a CLD problem-solving model; and (3) identify if personal characteristics impact implementation practices of a CLD problem-solving model. Feedback from an expert panel was used to validate the content of a newly developed CLD problem-solving survey. An in-state procedural pilot study was conducted using a sample of state association members. The primary dissertation study was a revised version of the in-state procedural study using a larger, more representative sample of school psychologists identified in states with large CLD populations. Ratings for perceived value, skills level, and frequency of implementation practices were collected. Methods of analyses included: (1) item analyses; (2) descriptive statistics; and (3) multiple regression. A factor analysis was used to evaluate the underlying factors of the newly, developed CLD problem-solving process. Results are expected to better assist trainers with the improvement of professional development trainings related to CLD competencies of school psychologists.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Public education has experienced an unprecedented growth of diversity within the student population and accompanying that growth are inequities that are present in our schools and communities.  Many school teachers and administrators have a limited awareness of how their own class, gender, and race impact their work, and often, do not see how their views about others&apos; class, gender, and race help to reproduce the social hierarchy.  These limited or uneducated views may also contribute to the achievement gap that exists between students belonging to the minority and non-minority groups.It is important to study these views and ask whether educators are able to increase awareness of their own class, gender, and race and reflect on how their views and beliefs impact their teaching. This study employed a multi-site design to compare four public middle schools in Colorado on perceptions of cultural competency as well as investigating possible correlations between these perceptions and the disaggregated discipline data for each of the schools.While it was not possible to confirm a relationship was between the average school site score on the Cultural Proficiency Continuum and discipline referrals of Hispanic students the qualitative data illuminated the perspectives of the participating teachers regarding cultural proficiency and the classroom.  The qualitative data revealed significant negative perspectives held by the participants regarding the largest student group in the middle schools in the study.  The focus group data illuminated the perspectives of the teachers in this study as well as their perception of the effect race and culture have on the middle school classroom.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to develop and initially validate the Managerial Success Factors Inventory: Transportation Version (MSFI: TV), a scale generated to more accurately assess managerial competence in transportation than general managerial competence and leadership scales. The literature on managerial competencies, leadership, and the state of transportation management is summarized. Reigning models of general managerial competency were used with focus group and cognitive interview data to develop the scale. The conventional three-phase scale development research design was followed (exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and validation phases) by administering the instrument to a sample of 287 managers from a state Department of Transportation (DOT). The hypothesized 4 cluster-11competency general managerial competency model that the scale was based on could not be found in the exploratory factor analysis. Instead, a five-factor solution was most interpretable; problem solving, emotional competence, initiative, safety leadership, and integrity. This model was then confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis. A higher-order model was also confirmed indicating the measure can be treated as unidimensional. Rasch analysis confirmed these findings. The paper details the use of Rasch and structural equation modeling to analyze the psychometric properties of the scale. Implications for use of the scale in selecting, training, and promoting leaders in transportation and future research needs on the scale are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Few scales exist that assess social competence in children with Asperger&apos;s and high functioning autism (AS/HFA).  Due to the nature of the disorder, the current social competence measures that do exist are not designed to assess the social difficulties that many children with AS/HFA encounter.  To meet this challenge a scale was developed to better understand social competence in children with AS/HFA, the Children&apos;s Social Competence Scale (CSCS).  Two studies that report the development and initial validation of the scale were conducted with children between the ages of 3 and 8 with and without a diagnosis of AS/HFA.  First, an exploratory factor analysis of an initial item pool yielded three factors assessing subscales of social skills, self-esteem, and social-emotional regulation.  Second, a confirmatory factor analysis supported the CSCS three-factor structure.  Third, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and validity coefficients supported the viability, use, and potential for continued development of this new instrument.  Finally, significant differences were found for sex and for diagnosis in the social skills, self-esteem, and social-emotional regulation subscales.  Implications for theory and research on social competence in children are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Discovering Border Crossings in Pagan Epic Literature</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation argues that border crossings were important to the ancient Celts and Norse as evidenced by the vast quantity of occurrences in their literature,and have remained important themes in literature throughout the ages. Border crossings reflect man&apos;s fascination with concepts beyond his immediate existenceand understanding. His reactions to such inexplicable phenomena have provided inspiration to writers for hundreds of years. The investigation uncovers examples of border crossings in the epic stories captured in the &lt;italic&gt;Ulster&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Fenian Cycles&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;TheTÃ¡in&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;The Eddas&lt;/italic&gt;, and &lt;italic&gt;The Mabinogion&lt;/italic&gt;.Border crossings remain important for modern literary scholars to consider because they have not vanished. Although they are perceived differently, the concepts remain an integral part of our literary heritage. Analysis which implements border crossing themes explored in this work enables critics to employa new methodology for engaging with literature, enhancing subtleties and observing moods and tones which might otherwise go unnoticed and unappreciated.  Man&apos;s natural, instinctive continuing curiosity regarding the supernatural and mystery of the unknown provide a continuing thread of border crossing examples.The epics of Ireland, Iceland, and Wales establish the foundation and environment of Otherworld activity for the romance and gothic genres which follow. The beautiful fairy-woman who convinces a mortal to follow her into the Otherworld; the &quot;beheading&quot; game; witches and potions; castles hidden in mists - these themeswill be employed by later authors to define the mood and tone in works such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Macbeth, and Dracula.Stories of the supernatural have fascinated mankind since storytelling began and scholarly research in the area of border crossings must begin with the early epics. Pagan stories of border crossings have a very different view of the themes than works written in a Christian environment. This work examines border crossings in the environment where the people actually believed an Otherworldexisted as part of their own world. The research provides a baseline of border crossing themes and a reflection of how the ancients perceived them. This investigation is summarized with a look at the themes through the centuries, observing how border crossings have changed and evolved. Identifying the significance of border crossings in the early epics provides an insight into understanding where and how they are implicated in later literary works, and offersa view where scholars may continue to search for new literary border crossings. Such occurrences should be taken into account because identifying the continued presence of border crossings in hundreds of years of literature allows us to engage with these works in a new way, implementing a new analysis methodology to seekother worlds while broadening our reading experience.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The enterprise of comparison has been regarded by some as one of the most vital characteristics of a healthy academic study of religion. However, the failed legacy of Eliadian Comparativism has caused others to suggest that the art of comparison has not yet lived up to its promise. This study brings together the best tools of what the author calls &quot;Smithian New Comparativism.&quot; In order to demonstrate concretely a rigorous and responsible critical comparative analysis, and to chart a course for future academically beneficial cross-cultural comparisons, this project presents a case study that compares two religious traditions&apos; doctrinal responses to a conceptually analogous ontological presupposition. Specifically, it analyzes comparatively the Reformed Christian doctrine of limited atonement and the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist doctrine of akunin shoki. The comparative examination of these teachings illuminates the respective traditions&apos; doctrinally divergent responses to a common understanding of the human predicament, reveals previously unseen structural and conceptual parallels between the traditions by examining deeply-rooted Western ideas through the lens of Buddhist theories, and suggests finally that despite the appearance of surface resemblances between Shin Buddhist and Reformed Christian thought the two religious paths lead ultimately to differing religious ends.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>As world communication, technology, and trade become increasingly integrated through globalization, multinational corporations seek employees with global leadership experience and skills.  However, the demand for these skills currently outweighs the supply.  Given the rarity of globally ready leaders, global competency development should be emphasized in higher education programs.  The reality, however, is that university graduate programs are often outdated and focus mostly on cognitive learning.  Global leadership competence requires moving beyond the cognitive domain of learning to create socially responsible and culturally connected global leaders.  This requires attention to development methods; however, limited research in global leadership development methods has been conducted.  A new conceptual model, the global leadership development ecosystem, was introduced in this study to guide the design and evaluation of global leadership development programs.  It was based on three theories of learning and was divided into four development methodologies.  This study quantitatively tested the model and used it as a framework for an in-depth examination of the design of one International MBA program. The program was first benchmarked, by means of a qualitative best practices analysis, against the top-ranking IMBA programs in the world.  Qualitative data from students, faculty, administrators, and staff was then examined, using descriptive and focused data coding.  Quantitative data analysis, using PASW Statistics software, and a hierarchical regression, showed the individual effect of each of the four development methods, as well as their combined effect, on student scores on a global leadership assessment.  The analysis revealed that each methodology played a distinct and important role in developing different competencies of global leadership.  It also confirmed the critical link between self-efficacy and global leadership development.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Teachers are at the frontline of education and student learning; districts and schools are investigating innovated, yet cost-effective, ways to positively address organizational variables such as job satisfaction and immediate intent to stay.  The implementation of employee health and fitness program could be a relatively simple way to not only address these issues but also positively impact the health and overall well-being of all employees.  Even with the supporting research regarding employee health and fitness programs, gaps and contradictions still exist; future research is necessary in order to draw conclusions regarding program value and justification.  The present study therefore sought to contribute to the knowledge base regarding the correlation between employee health and fitness programs and job satisfaction and intent to stay in the public school settings.  A number of district level directors and school level principals from public school districts in the state of Colorado completed an electronic questionnaire regarding the existence of an employee health and fitness program, details about such a program, reasons for sponsoring or not sponsoring such a program and whether or not incentives are linked to such a program.  Descriptive statistics and correlations were computed to test several hypotheses.In general, employees in districts and school sites that sponsor employee health and fitness programs seem to have higher job satisfaction than those who work in district and/or school sites that do not sponsor such programs.  There was no correlation between a sponsored employee health and fitness program and immediate intent to stay in education.  School districts that sponsor health and fitness programs seem to have higher job satisfaction than employees of school sites that sponsor health and fitness programs.  School districts and school sites that sponsor employee health and fitness programs have found a valuable way to impact job satisfaction among their employees.  These findings have important implications for school districts and school sites considering sponsoring and implementing a health and fitness program for their employees.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Response to Intervention framework is an effective means for or of identifying Specific Learning Disabilities.  This study examined one school&apos;s utilization of the framework in meeting the needs of a continuum of learners from those who struggle to those in need of advanced options.  A case study format was utilized, involving an elementary school in a suburban school district in Colorado.  Through classroom observations, teacher interviews and dialogue with the site&apos;s Problem-Solving Team, principal, and a focus group, the Response to Intervention framework proved to be an effective model in meeting the needs of all learners.  In addition, the RtI framework was used at this site as a more inclusive approach for identifying and serving gifted learners than traditional identification methods. The findings of this study have important implications with regard to instructional practices in general, as well as in gifted identification and programming practices.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the convergent validity between a third-party rating scale of executive function (EF) and a task-performance measurement of EF; examined the effects of age, gender, and dual language experience on preschool children&apos;s EF skills (inhibition, working memory (WM), and shifting) and on early mathematical skills; and investigated the contributions of inhibition, WM, and shifting to early mathematical skills. Ninety-two children attending Head Start were assessed. Correlation analyses revealed a number of relationships between the EF rating scale and the EF task-performance measure. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed a main effect of age on all EF measures and the math assessment and a significant difference between language groups on the measures of inhibition and shifting. Finally, hierarchal regression analyses revealed that WM and inhibition made unique contributions to children&apos;s early mathematical skills, and vocabulary scores made more contribution to early mathematical skills than either inhibition or WM. These findings extend previous research by (a) highlighting the issues involved with the assessment of EF in young children; (b) further supporting findings of preschool age-related changes in EF; (c) demonstrating EF differences with a DLL population; and (d) highlighting the importance of WM, inhibition, and language to mathematical learning, demonstrating the effects in early childhood. Implications of these findings for EF assessment in young children and prekindergarten curricula are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The national principal shortage caused by the competing factors of an aging workforce, along with recent changes to the role expectations of the principalship making the position less desirable to potential candidates have been well documented in recent years.  Effective schools research shows that principals are second only to classroom teachers in having a positive impact on student achievement.  Traditionally, new principals come from the ranks of current teachers.  This study explores the motivating and inhibiting factors that educators consider when deciding to pursue the principalship.A web-based survey was administered to teachers in a large school district with urban, suburban, and rural schools and 196 responses were analyzed.  The data from this study suggest the primary motivating factors to pursue the principalship are; the desire to make a positive difference for others, the ability to influence or improve a school, instructional leadership, the ability to initiate change, professional challenge, higher salary, developing and implementing a vision for school improvement, the desire to be a leader, personal challenge, and job opportunities for the future or movement along a career path.  The primary inhibiting factors are; the amount of stress, the politics of the position, working with parents in negative or contentious situations, bureaucracy, the impact on family life or family responsibilities, the distance from the classroom or student contacts, the length of the work day, the length of the work week, accountability for student achievement, and the amount of responsibility.  These results are consistent with Hertzberg&apos;s Motivation-Hygiene Theory, which states that motivating factors are primarily intrinsic and inhibiting factors are primarily extrinsic.  Additionally, this study showed relationships between other factors and motivation to pursue the principalship.  Specifically, encouragement by others, participation in a leadership role, and possession of a principal&apos;s license were all linked to increased interest in the principalship.  Finally, recommendations are offered to districts and higher education regarding ways that they can mitigate or address the factors surrounding the principal shortage.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Family systems providing informal care and support to their aging relatives, who were residing in assisted living systems and receiving formal care were central to this study. A broader understanding of family involvement, with respect to exploring both care-receiver and caregiver roles and relationships, within the regulatory and environmental context of assisted living was sought through a qualitative research process. This study employed a phenomenological approach to conduct in-depth interview sessions with eight pairs of participants, comprising elderly residents in five assisted living facilities and their respective caregiving family members, typically a daughter or son and, in one case, a close friend, all of whom were personally interviewed. A total of 16 participants were interviewed individually. The three dominant themes that emerged from care-receivers and their caregiving relatives&apos; experiences, which characterized and impacted their family involvement, were (1) Coping efforts and attitudes that characterize the aging, the care-receiving, and the caregiving processes; (2) Enduring and changing roles and relationships in family systems; and (3) The paradox of institutional long-term care, as it created both relief and stress for elderly care-receivers&apos; and their caregivers in family systems. A systems/ecological framework is applied to explicate these findings, and policies pertaining to assisted living, and their economic implications for the long-term care process are also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study explored the differences in experiences of social class identity dissonance between first-generation college students and non-first-generation college students. Additionally, this study aimed to examine the effect of social class identity dissonance on psychological distress in first-generation college students, as well as, whether an anti-social dominance orientation partially buffers the relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress.A total of 1,109 college students from two local, four-year institutions participated in the study. The first research objective was to examine the differences between first-generation college students and non-first-generation college students on reported levels of social class identity dissonance. The next objective was to investigate whether social class identity dissonance mediates the relationship between generation status and psychological distress. The last objective was to explore whether having an anti-dominance orientation helps buffer the relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress. An independent samples t-test and hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the three hypotheses.A number of important findings were revealed by the results of the study. There appeared to be a significant, positive relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress. As social class identity dissonance increases in individuals, symptoms of psychological distress also increase. Additionally, social class identity dissonance was a significant predictor of psychological distress. No significant differences were seen between first-generation college students and their peers in this sample, and there did not appear to be a significant relationship between generation status and psychological distress, therefore, hypotheses one and two were rejected. Furthermore, social dominance orientation did not significantly moderate the relationship between social class identity dissonance and psychological distress; thus, the third hypothesis was also rejected.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This work addresses how traditions associated with canon law of late medieval international society granted authority to myriad polities in fifteenth and sixteenth century questions of societal governance. In international relations, the late medieval period has rarely been given much attention; scholars have argued that the late medieval period is too &quot;local&quot; of an event to be considered within broader historical discussions of international societies and systems. This, however, is highly ironic considering that late medieval international society saw itself in universalist terms. It is precisely because late medieval international society was founded upon universalism, but organized on the basis of particular polities that it is such a valuable resource for understanding modern international society.I provide a historical narrative of the process in which a &quot;tradition of canonical status&quot; developed and allowed multiple political actors to all claim authority based upon the same universal foundations; this &quot;tradition of canonical status&quot; is understood as the set of historical practices, norms and ideas--starting as early as the second and third centuries--that allowed the formal system of canon law to develop in the twelfth century. I argue that it did not disappear with the inception of a formal legal system, but rather its customary practices took place in the context of the new legal system. The narrative then explains how this tradition of canonical status was brought into the Reformations era--which is  periodized here as 1414-1563--and in doing so it illustrates the traditional character of the period, which runs counter to both historians&apos; and IR scholars&apos; renditions of the era as a sharp break from the past.In international relations, this sharp break is associated with the emergence of the modern nation-state and sovereign territoriality. This work instead argues that myriad polities continued to base their authority on the tradition of canonical status, which I demonstrate through a discussion of outcomes at societal congresses. Specifically, in the fifteenth century, the predominant theme was the debate regarding conciliarism--the school of thought that viewed the council as potentially the highest societal authority--while the sixteenth century, or the period of confessionalization, was dominated by discussions of documenting discordant understandings of previously shared practices. Out of these historical processes arose the &quot;invention of religion&quot;: before the sixteenth century, the religious and the political were inseparable, while after this religion and politics became distinct but interdependent. Their continuing interdependence informs an understanding of the gradual, but not inevitable process towards modern international society based on territoriality.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer and accounts for 30 - 35% of all cancers in children. Significant improvement in the treatment of pediatric ALL has been achieved in recent years. Only 50 years ago, the disease was uniformly fatal with an Overall Survival (OS) rate &lt; 5%.  Modern-day, multi-drug chemotherapy is associated with an overall survival rate over 80%. Standard-risk ALL comprises the majority of ALL with an overall survival approaching 90%. Despite this success, children who relapse from this disease accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths in children. The backbone of treatment protocols have incorporated somatic but not host genetic features in the treatment regimens. The current study examined 12 genetic polymorphisms affecting the pharmacodynamics of antileukemic drugs in an attempt to identify biologic markers related to the risk of disease relapse.In the current research program, 125 standard-risk ALL patients who were treated at The Children&apos;s Hospital were enrolled in a retrospective study. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms and risk of disease relapse in this study cohort. The GSTM1 null genotype was associated with a decreased risk of disease relapse (HR = 0.394, 95% CI = 0.127 - 1.224, P = 0.107). A combination analysis of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes revealed a stronger association between the both the GSTM1 and GSTT1 normal genotype and an increased risk of leukemia relapse (HR = 2.73, 95% CI = 0.9 - 7.9, P = 0.063), compared with patients having either the GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotype. A &quot;drug exposure&quot; model was used in this study. The risk of relapse in individual with a low or intermediate &quot;drug exposure&quot; genotype increased 2.4-fold (HR = 2.39, 95% CI = 0.8 - 6.9, P = 0.107) compared with the high &quot;drug exposure&quot; genotype. No significant associations with relapse were observed for the CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, MTHFR C667T, MTHFR A1298G, or TYMS polymorphisms. The findings from this single institution study suggest that polymorphisms within genes of the GST superfamily may influence the treatment outcome in standard-risk ALL. They also point to the need of prospective, large multi-institutional studies to validate these findings prior to clinical implementation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation traces the emergence of the global human rights movement, investigates the role of popular culture as a vehicle for mobilization, and critically examines why the movement has failed to adequately politicize its supporters in the process. Beginning in the mid-1970s, a broad shift began to take place in which ordinary people were routinely confronted with human suffering, as conflict and crisis assumed a role as ritualized news events. The public response to these phenomena demonstrated a capacity for solidarity and engagement based on cosmopolitan premises. The inception of a collective ethos of compassion, an awareness of the other based on empathy, can be considered a symptom of globalization, of a moral variety, and is a byproduct of shifting economic trends, advances in technology, and efforts toward transnational organization. Support for human rights advocacy has gained traction as a mainstream social cause and provides a set of principles with which average people mediate the world and their role in it. Yet, this transformation did not occur spontaneously, but rather was deliberately cultivated by movement architects through a series of popular culture mechanisms. However, the methods and strategies deployed to enlist the public in defense of human rights shaped the substance of their engagement. This dissertation addresses the discrepancy between the political content of advocacy campaigns and the failure of the campaigns to politicize supporters, suggesting flaws in the foundation of the human rights movement. In order to set itself on a path toward relevance and effectiveness, the movement must inculcate political engagement, maintain an alignment of principle and action, and resist the seductive features of the age of consumerism.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Over the past decades there has been a great deal of research on developing high frequency micromechanical resonators. As the two most common and conventional MEMS resonators, piezoelectric and electrostatic resonators have been at the center of attention despite having some drawbacks. Piezoelectric resonators provide low impedances that make them compatible with other low impedance electronic components, however they have low quality factors and complicated fabrication processes. In case of electrostatic resonators, they have higher quality factors but the need for smaller transductions gaps complicates their fabrication process and causes squeezed film damping in Air. In addition, the operation of both these resonators deteriorates at higher frequencies.In this presented research, thermally actuated resonators with piezoresistive readout have been developed. It has been shown that not only do such resonators require a simple fabrication process, but also their performance improves at higher frequencies by scaling down all the dimensions of the structure. In addition, due to the internal thermo-electro-mechanical interactions, these active resonators can turn some of the consumed electronic power back into the mechanical structure and compensate for the mechanical losses. Therefore, such resonators can provide self-Q-enhancement and self-sustained-oscillation without the need for any electronic circuitry. In this research these facts have been shown both experimentally and theoretically. In addition, in order to further simplify the fabrication process of such structures, a new controlled batch fabrication method for fabricating silicon nanowires has been developed. This unique fabrication process has been utilized to fabricate high frequency, low power thermal-piezoresistive resonators. Finally, a new thermal-piezoresistive resonant structure has been developed that can operate inside liquid. This resonant structure can be utilized as an ultra sensitive biomedical mass sensor.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Identifying Quality Mentoring Based On New Teacher Perceptions of Professional Development</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Despite the fact that new teacher mentoring had its inception in the late 1960&apos;s and is currently mandated in schools and districts across the country, there are still questions as to whether effectiveness has been obtained (Keay, 2007).  Stewart (2004) arrived at a definition of &quot;quality mentoring&quot; based on five areas of support (i.e., Personal Support, Classroom Support, Professional Support, Evaluative Support, and Reflective Support), and her research provides definition to the kind of support that mentees desire and need.The purpose of this study was to examine an existing survey that was designed for a large urban district&apos;s evaluation of a grant-funded teacher-mentoring program (i.e., the New Teacher Support Program).  The researcher coded the existing program evaluation survey according to Stewart&apos;s categories, and this process identified the presence of research-based categories within the existing evaluation of a mentoring program.  The researcher then analyzed the results from the two groups of new teachers involved in this study, the New Teacher Support Program participants (NTSP) and the Non-New Teacher Support Program participants (Non-NTSP), to understand which components of mentoring were the most important to the mentees based on their perceptions.The findings from this study were that all survey respondents perceived that they received support from their mentors.  All survey respondents perceived more support in the Personal Support category, followed very closely by the categories of Professional Support, Classroom Support and Reflective Support.   The existing survey contained items that corresponded to all of Stewart&apos;s categories except Evaluative Support.  There were differences between the responses of the two groups (i.e., the NTSP and non-NTSP participants) especially in the category of Reflective support.  There was also evidence that the mentees used the support received from their mentors to adjust their instructional practices.The findings demonstrate that the new teachers in one urban school district did perceive support from having a mentor.  More research should be conducted regarding how support from mentors translates into improved instruction and student outcomes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Currently there is an increasing focus on teacher quality in educational reform, a lack of empirical research on exactly what culturally responsive teaching looks like, and a great deal of confusion on how teacher dispositions may be important in education. This study seeks to examine what great teachers believe, intend, and do while examining their dispositions in the process.Three research questions guided this study: 1) What are the intentions and beliefs of culturally responsive teachers? 2) How does culturally responsive teaching operationalize? 3) What are the dispositions of culturally responsive teachers? To respond to these questions, I use Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship, a qualitative research method developed by Eliot Eisner (1998). Educational criticism is comprised of four dimensions: description, interpretation, evaluation, and thematics.The findings suggest that there are similarities in the intentions, beliefs, operations, and dispositions of culturally responsive teachers. However, it was readily apparent that culturally responsive teaching operationalized differently for different teachers, leaving us to recognize that we cannot simply give teachers a checklist to ensure that great teaching manifests. Further, the study revealed that while the participants sought to reach the aims of what many culturally responsive scholars seek, they are confused by the label resulting in unintended consequences. This leads to the suggestion of evolving the label culturally responsive pedagogy to personalized pedagogy. Finally, the study recognizes the controllable and uncontrollable contexts of education. This has broad sweeping ramifications for policymakers and administrators, as they must recognize in their hunt for identifying what quality teachers do, there are a number of elements outside of teachers&apos; control that affect students&apos; educations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has consistently shown that approximately 40% of American students cannot read at grade level. In fact, most of these 40% of students read considerably below grade level. Unfortunately, these results have remained consistent in spite of reports such as the Nation at Risk in 1983 that first alerted everyone to the severity of the problem and provided remedies on how it could be remedied. The Nation at Risk Report was the impetus for a plethora of educational reform enactments at the federal level such as George H. Walker Bush&apos;s education summit in 1989, Goals 2000, the No Child Left Behind Act and the latest reform measure Race To The Top. In addition, states have enacted their own proficiency standards for student knowledge in reading. Several reading experts such as Louisa Moats and Louise Spear-Swerling have written reading standards that teachers should know to teach reading. The Common Core Standards have been adopted by at least 41 states that outline best reading practices and the International Reading Association has also developed reading standards.

The reading wars have also been a contributory factor to the poor reading scores. The reading wars pitted the whole language advocates against the phonics adherents. When the National Reading Report (2000) and the National Research Council Report (1998), released their results that reading instruction should include phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension, the reading wars were thought to be over. However, this has not been the case.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether a consensus exists for best reading practices among reading experts. Seven reading experts were interviewed and six of the participants agreed that reading instruction should include the five components: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. The seventh participant agreed that reading instruction contains the five components, however, the main component to teach reading is comprehension. The results have implications for developing a standard of care for reading (reading standards that can be adopted nationally) and the instruction of new teachers by universities.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Kids and Kingdom: The Precarious Presence of Children in the Synoptic Gospels</dc:title>

  <dc:description>At a time when institutions of faith are increasingly confronted with scandals that have brought the vulnerability of young children to the fore of religious consciousness, some scholars have pointed to Jesus&apos; special concern and affection for children in the Gospels. Scholars are struck by how often the authors place Jesus in relation to children: healing them, blessing them, and challenging their marginal status by characterizing them as models for understanding the kingdom of God proclaimed by Jesus. If the authors had concluded their stories of Jesus&apos; eschatological gathering with the blessing of the children, then their characterizations of children might seem nearly unparalleled. Yet, the narratives continue; children appear less; Jesus and the disciples move on.This work challenges the extent to which our long held interpretation that `Jesus loved the little children&apos; is well grounded in the gospel narratives. Instead, it is argued that the inclusion of young children in the kingdom of God presented in the Synoptic narratives is tempered by images of household disruption and alienation of children as a consequence of Jesus&apos; eschatological gathering of followers. Assuming the multivocality texts, a deconstructive literary approach is applied to the Synoptic Gospels, foregrounding children over other characters in relation to Jesus&apos; adult ministry. Passages such as healing narratives involving children, the `Child in the Midst&apos; (Mark 9:36-37 and par.), `One of These Little Ones&apos; (Mark 9:42 and par.), and `Let the Little Children Come to Me&apos; (Mark 10:13-16) are examined against sayings relativizing family ties and the lifestyle indicative of the radical call to discipleship in the Synoptic narratives. This work seeks not to resolve but to highlight the tensions between attempts at child inclusivity and the radical demands of discipleship on families.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study is an assessment of whether a language acculturation discrepancy (LAD) within families is most predictive of emotional and behavioral problems for Latina/o youth when relevant variables are controlled. A sample of predominantly Mexican American parent-child dyads was recruited to complete a language-based measure of acculturation and parent participants completed an assessment of their child&apos;s emotional and behavioral functioning. Results indicated a total difference value between parent-child levels of language acculturation to be most predictive of the outcome.  Additionally, the child&apos;s level of language acculturation, independent of that of the parent, was also found to account for a significant amount of variance.  Results indicate support for the acculturation gap-distress hypothesis based on discrepancies in language use and proficiency.  Limitations of the findings and directions for future research are also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>LOVE THROUGH A WIDE-ANGLE LENS: A MYTHIC NARRATIVE AND FEMINIST CRITIQUE OF THE REALITY COMPETITION DATING SHOW MORE TO LOVE</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Obesity is on the rise in the United States and reality television has also risen to the charge of representing fatness. More to Love was the first reality competition dating show to afford fat women a chance at reality show love. The purpose of the study was to look at how fat women are portrayed on reality competition dating shows. The purpose of this study is to understand how the mythic narrative of love through a feminist lens informed by LeBesco, Bordo, Hill Collins, and hooks are in conversation with each other in More to Love. This study found that the women were written into a fairy tale where they were afforded no ownership in their story. The bachelor, Luke, and their fatness controlled their destinies and their &quot;happily-ever-afters.&quot; Their identity was portrayed through their fatness, gender, and sexual orientation over any other identifying markers. The relationships with Luke and with food were found to be the main relationships evident. The study found that the show is unsuccessful in normalizing fat women as equally afforded the myth of love as thin women. It proliferates the totalizing of the identity of fat while minimalizing any other identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Despite the progress that has been made in revolutionary theorising over the past few years, most theorists of social change continue to neglect the influence of opposition leaders upon the revolutionary process. One of the few exceptions in this regard is Max Weber. In his analysis of legitimate authority, Weber asserts that the charismatic form of authority rests on popular devotion to the normative order ordained by a specific person at a time of crisis.Though his work offers some important insights into the revolutionary process, Weber fails to take into account the conditions that give rise to such forms of authority in the first place. This is why the state-in-society approach is so important. It analyses the interactions of multiple sets of formal and informal groups that promote different conceptions of political order. The focus here is not so much on whether a state provides opportunities for people to act, but how the practices of states generate justifiable collective grievances and ideologies in the first place.This is significant because revolutionary theorising needs to recognise the processes by which states influence the identities and ideas of various opposition groups in society. Where state practices contend with very different forms of social behaviour, people tend to be drawn into revolutionary movements because they are inspired by the vision of those who offer an escape from the unjust practices of the state. As we will see, this was certainly true in Cuba and Iran, where Fidel Castro and Ayatollah Khomeini came to assume paramount roles in revolutionary movements committed to very different forms of socio-economic justice.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis addresses several problems in the facility location sub-area of computational geometry.  Let &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt; be a set of&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; points in the plane.  We derive algorithms for approximating &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt; by a step function curve of size &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;n&lt;/italic&gt;, i.e., by an &lt;italic&gt;x&lt;/italic&gt;-monotone orthogonal polyline &lt;italic&gt;R&lt;/italic&gt; with &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;n&lt;/italic&gt; horizontal segments.  We use the vertical distance to measure the quality of the approximation, i.e., the maximum distance from apoint in &lt;italic&gt;S&lt;/italic&gt; to the horizontal segment directly above or below it.  We consider two types of problems: min-&lt;italic&gt;epsilon&lt;/italic&gt;, where the goal is to minimize the error for a given number of horizontal segments &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;/italic&gt;and min-#, where the goal is to minimize the number ofsegments for a given allowed error &lt;italic&gt;epsilon&lt;/italic&gt;. AfterO(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;)preprocessing time, we solve instances of the latter in O(min{&lt;italic&gt;klog n, n&lt;/italic&gt;}) time per instance.We can then solve the former problem in O(min{&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;nklog n&lt;/italic&gt;}) time.Both algorithms require O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;) space.The second contribution is a heuristic for the min-&lt;italic&gt;epsilon&lt;/italic&gt; problem that computes a solution within a factor of 3 of the optimal error for &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;/italic&gt; segments, or with at most the same error as the &lt;italic&gt;k&lt;/italic&gt;-optimal but using &lt;italic&gt;2k - 1&lt;/italic&gt; segments.  Furthermore, experiments on real data show even better results than what is guaranteed by the theoretical bounds.  Both approximations run in O(&lt;italic&gt;nlogn&lt;/italic&gt;) time and O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;) space.Then, we present an exact algorithm for the weighted version of this problem that runs in O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;) time and generalize the heuristic to handle weights at the expense of an additional &lt;italic&gt;logn&lt;/italic&gt; factor.  At this point, a randomized algorithm that runs in O(&lt;italic&gt;nlog&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;)expected time for the unweighted version is presented.  It easily generalizes to the weighted case, though at the expense of an additional logn factor.  Finally, we treat the maximinproblem and present an O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;3&lt;/super&gt;&lt;italic&gt;logn&lt;/italic&gt;) solution to the problem of finding the furthest separating line through a set of weighted points.  We conclude with solutions to the ``obnoxious&quot; wedge problem:  an O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;&lt;italic&gt;logn&lt;/italic&gt;) algorithm for the general case of a wedge with its apex on the boundary of the convex hull of S and an O(&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;super&gt;2&lt;/super&gt;) algorithm for the case of the apex of a wedge coming from the input set S.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A mixture of different mtDNA molecules in a single sample is a significant obstacle to the successful use of standard methods of mtDNA analysis (i.e., dideoxy dye-terminator sequencing). Forensic analysts often encounter either naturally occurring mixtures (e.g., heteroplasmy) or situational mixtures typically arising from a combination of body fluids from separate individuals. The ability to accurately resolve and interpret these types of samples in a timely and cost efficient manner would substantially increase the power of mtDNA analysis and potentially provide valuable investigative information by allowing its use in cases where the current approach is limited or fails. Therefore, this research was aimed at developing a strategy for the use of Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) as a developmentally-validated forensic application for resolving mixtures of mtDNA. To facilitate the adoption of this technology by the forensic community, a significant effort has been made to ensure that this technology meets the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) developmental validation criteria and interfaces smoothly with previously validated methods of forensic mtDNA analysis. To do this, the method developed using DHPLC employs mtDNA amplicons, PCR conditions and DNA sequencing protocols validated for use in forensic laboratories. These factors are essential in implementing DHPLC analysis in a forensic casework environment and for the admissibility of DHPLC and Linkage Phase Analysis in court.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Social participation in late adulthood through activities such as volunteering with charities, playing sports, and joining clubs can increase life satisfaction, directly by providing enjoyable engagement and indirectly by increasing a person&apos;s sense of social connectedness. When reported levels of different types of activities are used to measure social participation, conventional measure development procedures based on classical test theory lead to a proliferation of small participation subscales that don&apos;t show good reliability, don&apos;t have theoretical power, and don&apos;t match researchers&apos; conceptions of the dimensions of participation. Based on the poor performance of conventional approaches, some researchers have suggested that social participation should be modeled as an index composed of its indicators rather than as a scale in which indicators reflect an underlying latent factor. Typical approaches in psychosocial research rely on reflective-indicator models, which correspond to scale development, rather than incorporating composite variables with causal indicators. The latter approach, where manifest indicators are specified as causing the unobserved construct, is sometimes known as formative measurement, since the construct of interest is formed by its indicators. This study compared a scale model of social participation based on reflective measurement to an index model based on formative measurement.Using a sample representative of community-dwelling U.S. adults over age 65 from the Health and Retirement Study&apos;s 2008 wave of data collection, two alternative measurement models of participation were constructed using sixteen items that recorded frequency of participation in different activities. Because patterns of participation differed for males and females, gender-specific models were developed. The scale models assigned participation items to subscales based on item intercorrelations. The index model assigned items to participation composites based on predictive associations with the outcomes of social connectedness and life satisfaction.The index construction process led to a unidimensional representation of participation, composed of six of the original sixteen participation activity items. The initial attempts to build a scale model led to structures with many small factors and poor predictive validity. Based on the findings of unidimensionality for the index model, a single-factor scale model was explored for female respondents only. Results showed that both index and scale approaches have the potential to produce participation models that are parsimonious, well-fitting, and externally valid even though conventional scale development rules-of-thumb and current conceptions of the domains of participation lead the researcher to non-parsimonious, poorly-fitting solutions lacking predictive capability.Participation measurement instrument developers often theorize the existence of three or more dimensions of participation. Whether they use conventional (reflective indicator) or more radical (formative indicator) models, they are advised, based on this study&apos;s results, to evaluate a single-dimensional structure among their candidate models.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study gathered data from 147 employees in two U.S. headquartered multinational manufacturing companies. Participants responded to questions about their work-related values, perceptions of the productivity of their work teams, and the degree of operational integration between firms&apos; foreign affiliate offices and their U.S. based headquarters. Additionally, analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between team productivity and psychic distance, which is a measure of country-level cultural differences. Work values were assessed using The Values Scale (Neville &amp; Super, 1989), perceptions of team productivity were assessed used an instrument by Kirkman and Rosen (1999), degree of operational integration was measured using a set of items developed by Slangen (2006), and psychic distance was assessed using a scale created by Hakanson and Ambos (2010). As expected, work values were found to be different between a firm&apos;s headquarters and a foreign office and work values predicted perceptions of team productivity when controlling for the age of the team. Psychic distance was found to predict team productivity when team age was controlled, and a more highly integrated degree of operational integration was found to relate to perceived productivity. Contrary to expectation, a significant interaction was not found to exist between work values, degree of integration, and psychic distance. However, a significant interaction was found between psychic distance and work values. Implications of the findings, limitation of the data, and directions for future research are also presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation seeks to understand the role of women as political actors in the rise of Islamo-nationalist movement in Palestine. Using a historical and ethnographic approach, it examines the changing opportunity structures available to Palestinian women in the nationalist struggle between 1987 and 2007. It looks into the sites of political engagement of Palestinian women as mothers, organizers and political candidates, suicide bombers, and nonviolent activists with attention paid to the evolution of the Islamist ideology within these four pathways for political participation. The goal of this work is to engage the question of how some Palestinian women who appear to diverge from the commitments of feminist emancipatory visions are active participants in the Islamist transformation of the Palestinian nationalist struggle. In doing so, this dissertation seeks to unveil the evolution of gender relations within the Palestinian nationalist struggle while providing a deeper analysis of the emergence and significance of the Islamist movement in contemporary Palestinian society. It makes an interdisciplinary contribution to existing literature in nationalism and post-colonial studies, social movements, identity politics and feminist political thought in the Middle East.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>PARENTED EMOTION: A STUDY OF ADULT-CHILDREN&apos;S EMOTION SOCIALIZATION AND FAMILY COMMUNICATION PATTERNS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Using the General Theory of Family Communication Patterns (FCPT) and Emotion Regulation Theory (ERT) of Meta-emotion, Parenting, and Child Outcomes, this dissertation sought to investigate adults&apos; emotion socialization in their family of origin through an examination of multiple family schemata. Furthermore, the interactions of parental meta-emotions, family communication patterns, and family communication environments were investigated. Two surveys were used in this study. First, 228 adult-children across two universities in the western United States responded to items retrospectively describing the family communication patterns and family communication environments within their home of origin during their adolescence. Additionally, adult-children described the meta-emotion philosophies of their parents during the adult-child&apos;s adolescence. Analysis of the data revealed a positive association between emotion coaching (EC) and conversation orientation, as well as positive associations between emotion dismissing (ED) and both conversation and conformity orientations. In examining meta-emotion philosophies across FCP family types, unique interactions were observed across levels of EC, ED, conversation orientation, and conformity orientation. Notably, conversation and conformity orientations acted as reciprocal suppressor variables of ED within consensual families. Further, ED was undifferentiated across pluralistic, protective, and laissez-faire families. Levels of EC were undifferentiated between consensual and pluralistic families, and levels of EC were also undifferentiated between protective and laissez-faire families. Expressiveness and conflict avoidance were both predictive of EC, while all three family communication environments were predictive of ED. A second survey compared the perspectives of 63 adult-children recalling how they were parented against the perspectives of their primary caregivers recalling how they parented their child during adolescence. Adult-child and caregiver perspectives were undifferentiated in how they recalled levels of ED, however, caregivers recalled higher levels of EC than their adult-children. These results indicate the complexity of family schemata and how they influence family communication. Moreover, explaining levels of ED versus EC may be more complex than describing family expressivity or levels of interaction amongst family members. Lastly, the overall investigation of family schemata offers a unique description of family emotional environments. The implications of the results for FCPT, ERT, and family communication research, limitations, and directions for further research were also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) formerly known as domestic violence, is a chronic public health crisis affecting millions of women. Significant research has been generated related to the prevention and treatment of IPV; however, despite these efforts, there continues to be discrepancies in screening, referrals, and treatment of IPV which are compounded for ethnic minorities. Latinos are the fasting growing minority population in the United States, yet there continues to be a lack of public awareness and research related to Latina survivors of IPV. There are currently no studies exploring the subjective experience for Latina survivors of IPV in therapy.The objective of this study was to ascertain a culturally grounded understanding in Latina survivors of IPV perceptions of therapists&apos; cultural and IPV competence using a qualitative methodology. For this study, 10 Latina women over the age of 18 were selected, who self-reported experiencing IPV and who had participated in therapy for their IPV experience. Participants were recruited using flyers distributed in various community agencies, domestic violence shelters, and by Snowball sampling method. Each participant was interviewed twice and using a phenomenological methodology, structural and textural descriptions were generated and clusters of themes were identified from interview transcriptions.Findings in this study suggest that therapist characteristic&apos;s that allowed for a positive rapport was not necessarily related to their perceptions of their therapists&apos; cultural competence or competence in providing IPV counseling. Additionally, an ethnic match alone did not seem to compensate for cultural or IPV competence as expected. Themes generated from participant interviews identify specific behaviors perceived as Accepting Behaviors and Rejecting Behaviors. These themes provide valuable information on how culturally relevant interventions can be further enriched and developed in working with Latina survivors of IPV.In addition to themes generated from participant interviews, related to the proposed research questions, a number of contextual themes were identified. These themes provide a contextual framework for the cultural variables informing participant perceptions of therapy and the therapeutic alliance. They also provide valuable information on how cultural and socio-environmental factors deter Latina survivors of IPV from seeking treatment or disclosing IPV.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>While this research appears to be about horses and riding, it is really a project about the conditions of White women, White femininity, and feminist futurities. Driven by my investment in imagining possibilities of dismantling Whiteness and heteropatriarchy, this research begins to mark the dominant performances of White femininity and those fleeting moments of disruption by White women. My intentions for this project were to stage performances of feminist futurities that imagine feminist aesthetics as relational probabilities towards feminist alliances.The research was drawn from a six month critical performance ethnography of a local Hunter/Jumper barn. This critical performance ethnography was also informed by co-performative interviews, embodied cultural memory of my life long experiences within this community, and critical rhetorical analysis of vernacular discourses within the site to speak to and enlighten my ethnographic findings. My analysis was informed by my conceptualization of affective intersectionality.The research findings expose how White-supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy is served by White women and the possibilities within their performative disruptions of normative politics. The analysis reveals how the performance of class maintains affective qualities that discipline White femininity into serving White heteropatriarchy but these performances of White feminine elitist classism break the relational possibilities between horse and rider. The research locates the doings and undoings of White feminine civility when White women&apos;s bodies serve or disrupt normativity.Next, the relational aspects of the performance of riding render lessons in affective reasoning that reveals an embodied-communicative-performative space to deconstruct White femininity. Affective reasoning frames new forms of communication that are not beyond Whiteness but actually allots White women new means to negotiate the performance of White femininity. These potential feminist performatives challenges White capitalist heteropatriarchal binds on White women&apos;s bodies in order to engage with others.Finally, embodied feminist aesthetics best weaves these two analytical findings together to picture a culminating view of feminist futurities that stretch towards a horizon of feminist alliances. Embodying feminist aesthetics allots normative framings of power to become reshaped and perhaps remade. Feminist aesthetics stages utopian performatives that White women both can and should performatively engage in order to foster feminist futurities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The objective of the current study was to examine Relationship Satisfaction, Personal Commitment and Trust, and Perceived Partner Commitment and Trust among long-distance and proximally close dating relationships of graduate students.  The sample included graduate students in long-distance and proximally close dating relationships. The study found that Perceived Partner Commitment significantly predicted Personal Trust over and beyond Personal Commitment. Study results also indicate that Personal Commitment and Personal Trust significantly predicted Relationship Satisfaction, but that, Perceived Partner Commitment did not. Results also indicated that participants in short-term long-distance relationships reported higher levels of Personal Commitment than participants in long-term long-distance relationships. Results indicated there was no difference in Commitment based on which partner traveled more.  Finally, for long-distance participants, Visits Per Year (face-to-face contact) was not related to Personal Commitment, Personal Trust, Perceived Partner Commitment or Perceived Partner Trust. Future research examining the differences between long-distance and proximally close dating relationships, larger sample sizes, and random samples will help to contribute to the little that is known about these unique relationships.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explored several predictors of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in a sample of 169 breast, prostate and colorectal cancer survivors. The first aim was to determine the influence of Anxiety, Depression and Perceived Threat (defined as the combination of Life Outlook Threat, i.e., the degree a cancer diagnosis challenged a survivor&apos;s assumptive world, and Physical Threat, i.e., threat to mortality and physical well-being) in the prediction of Positive and Negative Cognitive Processing. The second aim was to examine the effect of Anxiety, Depression, Perceived Threat, and Positive and Negative Cognitive Processing in the predication of PTG.Cancer survivors who were treated at one of the Denver Division clinics of the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center participated in the study. Since little empirical research has been conducted utilizing the variable of cognitive processing in the psychological literature, the study sought to investigate how Anxiety, Depression, and Perceived Threat were related to Positive and Negative Cognitive Processing. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore four primary hypotheses.The results of the study revealed several important findings. Physical Threat, Depression, and Permanent After-Effects of Cancer Treatment significantly predicted Positive Cognitive Processing, with lower levels of Physical Threat and Depression and no After-Effects of Treatment predicting higher Positive Cognitive Processing. Life Outlook Threat, Positive Cognitive Processing, and Type of Cancer Treatment Received also significantly predicted PTG. The findings indicated that greater life outlook threat and positive cognitive processing as well as receiving more than one form of cancer treatment predicted greater growth. None of the variables reached significance in predicting Negative Cognitive Processing and Negative Cognitive Processing failed to significantly predict PTG.While perceived threat and cognitive processing have a strong theoretical basis in the emergence of growth, the constructs have received little empirical attention. This is the first study that has assessed how being diagnosed with cancer challenges, rather than alters, a survivor&apos;s assumptive world. The results of the study provide evidence that increases in life outlook threat and positive cognitive processing are related to PTG.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since traditional principal preparation programs were scrutinized for inadequately training 21st century principals, alternative principal programs were designed to prepare principals to improve the US educational system and student achievement. One particular innovative program, the Daly Leadership Program, was collaboratively developed between the Pintler School District and the Intrepid University. The Daly Leadership Program was not only designed to balance leadership theory and practice, but also to produce transformative leaders capable of to navigating a moral dimension and promoting second order change.The purpose of this study was to investigate the leadership style of graduates from the Daly Leadership Program that were employed by the Pintler School District. First, it was determined if the program graduates identified themselves as transformative leaders or leaders who have the capacity to make second-order changes. Then it was determined if program graduates serving as school principals were perceived as transformative by the teachers on their staff. The leadership style of graduates was measured using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire created by Bass &amp; Avolio to define leadership behaviors on a Full Range Leadership continuum from Laissez-Faire to Transactional to Transformational.The results revealed that Daly graduates perceived themselves to be transformative leaders at a higher rate than the national norms. Teachers who worked with program principals perceived their principals as transformative as well. However, principals perceived themselves more transformative than their teachers perceived them to be in the areas of intellectual stimulation (encourages innovative thinking), individual consideration (coaches people), and contingent reward (rewards achievement). In fact, teachers perceived their principals lower than national norms in these three factors, but higher than national norms for inspirational motivation (inspires others) and idealized influence (builds trust and acts with integrity).This study indicated that there was alignment between the goals of the program and the perceived leadership style of graduates. It also indicated that the context of formal leadership roles might impact the perceptions of principals and teachers regarding leadership style.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Children in foster care move two times per year on average.  School records are not always transferred in a timely manner, which leads to a lack of services.  Schools often are not aware of the legal issues surrounding foster care, such as who has legal rights to sign field trip permission slips or consent for educational evaluations.  This study led to the development of an informational guideline as to how best support the school transition process for children in foster care.  The Delphi technique was used to enlist the expertise of four respondent groups: foster parents, Guardians ad Litem, school psychologists, and social services workers.  Data was gathered in three rounds.  Round 1 gathered information the respondents believed to be pertinent when a foster child transitions schools.  Round 2 synthesized and formalized information gathered from Round 1, and asked respondents their level of agreement and suggestions for improvement.  Round 3 led to the development of an informational guideline to promote smooth school transitions for children in foster care for respondents to review and approve.  The end product was a refined informational guideline intended for schools to utilize when a child in foster care transitions schools so that the child and school are prepared for the transition in the best possible way.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Rebuilding Character: The Practices of Positive Youth Development Teachers in a Youth Correctional Setting</dc:title>

  <dc:description>&lt;bold&gt;Abstract&lt;/bold&gt;There is a worldwide call for alternatives to current systems focused on restorative justice.  The United States currently has a process but no plan in implementing effective programs for rehabilitating youth offenders.  For many years, the prevailing idea in youth corrections has been that nothing works as studies continued to have difficulty pinpointing effective programs. Yet, over the last several decades, prison populations have risen dramatically, as have penal housing costs.Positive Youth Development (PYD) offers a different framework focused on developing youth assets and promoting positive adolescent development.  Derived from research in behavioral sciences, PYD programs promote the development of the five C&apos;s: competencies, character, connection, confidence, and caring/compassion.  Three additional PYD elements are held in common: a focus on developing strengths instead of targeting deficits, the promotion of prosocial relationships, and the use of multiple contexts and environments for adolescent development.This study examines a unique Denver Public charter high school/ youth correctional program currently embracing PYD in Watkins, Colorado: Ridge View Academy.  The goal of the study is to answer four research questions regarding implementing PYD in a correctional facility: 1.What does Positive Youth Development look like in a correctional setting? 2. What are the intentions of a Positive Youth Development teacher in a correctional setting? 3. How are those intentions revealed in that teacher&apos;s practice?  4.  What is the significance of the theories and practices ofPositive Youth Development teachers in a correctional setting for education and society in general?  This study found common themes in each teacher&apos;s classroom in the intentional, structural, and curricular domains.  The research found commonalities in the teachers&apos; intentions when working with the adjudicated youth.In summary, PYD was found to be an appropriate and effective for framework for working with correctional youth.  Furthermore, the study found the teachers&apos; intentions to be a significant factor in their motivation to engage in their PYD practice and reach students.  The study suggests a need for further research into the system-wide PYD program at Ridge View Academy or at any other sites where PYD is used as a framework for developing at-risk adolescents.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Given the changing global environment and different experiences of the new immigrants, it is necessary to delve into the question of how the notions and patterns of immigration and assimilation change through the lens of transnational migration that focuses on the connection of immigrants to the context of both sending and receiving countries.  Recognizing the transnational religious activities and creative adaptations of the new immigrants to new environments can enrich the study of assimilation, which reflects the changing picture of multilayered American society and its constituents.  To examine the assimilation process of Korean immigrants through their transnational religious activities, my research examines both organizations and individuals seeking long-distance spiritual and practical guidance to negotiate identities in a new land and find meaning to their lives.  Rather than assuming the inevitable process of assimilation, this study of Korean immigrants&apos; assimilation under the influence of transnational engagements can provide a changing understanding of assimilation, which emphasizes dynamic and reciprocal adaptations between immigrants and both sending and receiving societies.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>SCHOOL REFUSAL BEHAVIOR: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF LATINO/A CHILDREN&apos;S EXPERIENCES</dc:title>

  <dc:description>School refusal behavior (SRB) is a subset of absenteeism in which children either altogether refuse to attend school or experience great difficulty remaining in class for the duration of the school day. Child motivated SRB is a growing problem that now affects between 5% and 28% of children and adolescents at some point during their lives.  The effects of SRB can extend well beyond the classroom. Long-term, SRB can lead to delinquency and psychiatric, occupational, and marital problems in adulthood. Additionally, children who consistently exhibit SRB are more likely to drop out of school, thereby limiting their career choices and their earning potential.Though there has been considerable research conducted with school refusing youth, studies examining the impact of environmental and contextual factors on SRB with Caucasian samples have been few and with Latino/a children have been nonexistent. Additionally, the research has shown that a significant number of school refusing youth do not meet criteria for a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis. Therefore, it is imperative that researchers begin to look to external variables to garner an understanding of the factors that create and maintain SRB. The purpose of this studywas to gain a better understanding of the meaning and attributions children make of their school refusing behaviors.This study utilized a phenomenological design in which ten Latino/a children between the ages of 11 and 13 were interviewed on two separate occasions about their school refusal experiences. The students were asked open-ended questions about their relationships with peers, teachers, and family, as well as different facets of the school environment. All relevant statements from the interviews were categorized into themes in order to discover the essence of the experience.The interviews revealed each student faced multiple barriers to school attendance. In other words, their school refusal behaviors were impacted by many different factors. The co-researchers&apos; experiences were synthesized, and it was found that the most commonly endorsed factors concerned relationships, and their impact on SRB. Specifically, each child endorsed the quality of peer and teacher relationships as both being factors that heavily influenced his/her unwillingness to attend school. Other major themes that impacted the SRB of most participants were the way families viewed school attendance, children&apos;s support systems, relationships with parents, their experience of their schoolwork, and parental involvement. These and other findings highlight the systemic implications that need to address these concerns in order to better serve school refusing youth.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This collection of fiction that is not only a compilation of short stories, but a &quot;serial collection&quot;. That is, the stories are organized into series, and these series placed in a series as well, making up the book. The purpose of this organization is to figure out to what extent the arrangement of stories significantly contributes to the reader&apos;s understand of, and engagement with, the particular elements of each story as they are both replicated and modified within and throughout the series. If plot is, as E.M. Forster describes it, the narrative of events with an emphasis on causality, then this arrangement can show how plot can exist in varying forms. Specifically, it can disrupt the cause and effect rationale in favor of a more dynamic associative logic.In this collection, the first series of stories revolves around a set of characters, namely three sisters; the next around a single event, an abduction; and the third around a theme, the individual forging space in the social melee.Traditional story lines can oversimplify the correlative relationship between events--a single story line allows for a single answer--and ignore the complex interactions amongst characters, the stories that contain them, and the consciousness of the reader reading them. In Serial Fictions, aspects of the stories are interchangeable but not identical. The objective, then, is to require a different type of reader interaction than that most often required by the chronological structure; that is, one of participant rather than observer.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study tells the personal stories of three academically successful students of Mexican descent. The goal of this study was to give a counter to the stereotypical deficit view of Hispanic students in the eyes of teachers, parents, and other students.The participants were three high school students of Mexican descent attending an urban high school in Colorado. The research question of this study allowed the participants to tell their story of what it was like to be a student. The research question was: What are the personal and academic stories of academically successful Mexican urban high school students?Through in-depth interviews the students shared both their positive and negative experiences. The narratives revealed that each student had similar experiences. The study identified common experiences that became themes and through an analysis of the data, nine findings were identified: (listed alphabetically) adversity, college, discrimination friends/peer pressure, language barriers, parent/family support, pride, responsibility, and teacher support.By telling the stories of three successful students of Mexican descent, light will be shed on what helped these students become successful. These stories give the reader the opportunity to meet three students of Mexican descent though their stories of what it was like to be a student and to see how they were able to succeed and counter the narrative to the more commonly known deficit views of Hispanic students.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Survivor Song: The Voice of Trauma and Its Echoes</dc:title>

  <dc:description>For societies and cultures that experience mass torture and trauma, giving voice to the story of what happened is significant for both the specific individuals who have survived or witnessed the trauma, and the culture that is forced to process it and incorporate the experience into its collective identity. Testimonial literature that resulted from the detention and torture of desaparecidos under the military dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s and 80s, and the genocide of the Armenian people in 1915, reveals many different approaches in the ways that people write about torture and trauma. In attempting to find a voice to describe trauma, which is inherently indescribable, accounts range from factual histories to artistic endeavors intended to capture the truth of the experience being related. For many survivors, telling their stories is an act of resistance against the perpetrators&apos; attempts to silence them. Examining the voices of survivors and witnesses in the context of literary trauma theory and historiography allows the story itself to be considered in terms of the implications that it has for both those who tell it, and those who hear it. In the aftermath of trauma, the generations descending from the survivors are deeply affected by how the story of trauma has been transmitted through their families and cultures. It has powerful implications for both individual and collective identity, and this is vividly displayed in the gestures of memorialization, literature, and personal perspectives of those who live in post-traumatic cultures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation explores the rhetorical fragments in three case studies of the American Labor Movement constituting movement members in solidarity. Using Kenneth Burke&apos;s discussion of rhetorical substance, this project explores the possibilities for developing deep and broad forms of solidarity within the American Labor Movement. Rhetorical fragments of the Industrial Workers of the World, the United Farm Workers, and contingent faculty unionization efforts are explored.I argue Burke&apos;s ideas of substance and identification provide a powerful lens through which we can examine the solidary practices of social movements. Through the examination of the case studies mentioned, I demonstrate that solidarity was constructed using different points of identification for workers involved in the movement. These points of identification sometimes worked to the benefit and sometimes to the detriment of the movements described.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine the priorities of school principals in high poverty schools that have the potential to make the greatest impact on student achievement.   The study utilized secondary data analysis of a survey given to all Colorado educators to measure perceptions of school conditions, including leadership, along with school student achievement data.  The TELL (Teaching, Empowering, Learning and Leading) Colorado survey was administered online to educators.  The survey constructs were analyzed using Leithwood and Riehl&apos;s framework for effective leadership actions.  These actions include: setting direction, developing people, redesigning the organization and managing the instructional program.  The participants of the study are 167 schools designated by the state of Colorado as being high-poverty.   Data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential analyses. Schools were studied within two groups.  Schools identified as &quot;Centers for Excellence&quot; by the state of Colorado are designated high-poverty, high-growth schools.  A second, larger group of schools was classified as high-poverty, low-growth.  Leadership survey items were analyzed for both groups and comparisons made between the two.  Overall, results indicated that the higher perception of leadership within a school, the more likely the school was to be designated a `Center of Excellence&apos; by the state.â</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study utilized the ontological and epistemological foundations of critical realism posed by Margaret Archer (2000) to deepen social work&apos;s understanding of collaboration. Through the use of Danermark et al.&apos;s (2002) stages of explanatory research based on critical realism, the author found that agential and structural interactions of the Colorado Community Organizing Collaborative emerged. These findings illustrate that critical realism can be used in social work research to broaden the discipline&apos;s perception of human and environment. Archer&apos;s (2000) grounding of agency in three orders of reality, that practice is pivotal and morphogenesis is transformative aids in rediscovering how structure constrains or enables collaborative emergence.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Correlation Between Professional Learning Communities &amp; Collective Efficacy &amp; the Resulting Impact on Student Growth Data</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study in 2007 conducted by the National Center of Education Statistics revealed that the students in United States are scoring lower than several other countries in the areas of science and mathematics.  Students in other countries are able to compete globally for employment in professional occupations that were previously occupied by graduates from the United States.  Therefore, there is a sense of urgency to increase student achievement throughout the United States.  No Child Left Behind (2001) mandates that public schools develop accountability systems to ensure that all students achieve at the proficient or advance levels.  It goes further to mandate that school systems address achievement gaps between sub-groups.  Researchers have investigated the characteristics of effective schools in search of the solutions to address our student achievement gaps and achievement for all students.  Collective efficacy, the perception that a school has the capability to attain their goals, has been found to increase student achievement.  Likewise, research on effective learning organizations has also been found to increase student achievement.  There has been much research on each construct individually, however research on the relationships between these two constructs and the related impact on student achievement is beginning to emerge.This study investigates the correlation between teachers&apos; perception of collective efficacy and their school as an effective professional learning community and delving deeper to find a resulting relationship to student growth data.  Fourth and fifth grade teachers from a large suburban school district of 50, 000 students in the Denver Metro area participated in this study to assess whether there was a correlation between their level of perceived collective efficacy and their perception of their school as a professional learning community.  Roger Goddard&apos;s Collective Efficacy: Short Form questionnaire was used to assess collective efficacy.  Shirley Hord&apos;s School Professional Staff as Learning Community questionnaire was used to assess perceptions of learning communities.  Data from the Colorado Student Assessment Program of Spring 2009, student growth data specifically, was used to investigate correlations between student achievement to teachers&apos; perceptions of collective efficacy and learning communities.Analysis revealed that there is a positive correlation between collective efficacy and schools as professional learning communities.  The correlation was statistically significant at r= 476 p=.000.  Hord&apos;s questionnaire contains five dimensions of learning communities and four out of the five were found to be positively correlated to collective efficacy and were statistically significant.  However, the findings indicated that there was not a relationship between student growth data and collective efficacy or professional learning communities which was inconsistent with other studies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This pilot study undertook a mixed methods exploration of the interaction of art therapy and self-esteem in an adolescent eating disorder population.  Using therapeutic art books in a group format, adolescents created art about their feelings, their eating disorder, or whatever else they deemed important.  This art technique is relatively new and novel as an art therapy intervention.  Therefore, this study aimed to look at the technique&apos;s effectiveness at decreasing participants&apos; negative mood states and investigated the technique&apos;s ability to affect participants&apos; perceptions of their self-esteem.  Measures of global self-esteem and art therapy related self-esteem were measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Hartz Art Therapy Self-Esteem Scale, respectively.  In addition, the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) scale and visual analogue scale (VAS) of four negative mood states commonly found in individuals with eating disorders were also measured.  All participants were interviewed about their experience using the therapeutic art book technique at the conclusion of the study.  It was found that global self-esteem did not change over the four week study period.  Self-esteem related to art therapy trended upward, though still did not show statistically significant change.  The SUDS and VAS showed the greatest change after the first group session.  From participant interviews, four major themes were identified including art as distraction, significant difference from written journal, increased understanding of others, and art expressing more than words.  As this was a pilot study, future research ideas using this particular art therapy technique were presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Tyack &amp; Tobin (1994, p. 454) describe that the âgrammar of schooling,â like the shape of classrooms, has remained remarkably stable over the decades. This has frustrated generations of reformers who have fought to change standardized organizational traditions. Typically school reform has taken the form of innovations in education. Unfortunately, educational innovations don&apos;t usually last long or they were never truly innovations in the first place but rather a repackaging or reintroduction of age-old customary practices.The âEos Public Schoolsâ set out on a mission to integrate P-20 educational reform into its overall school system as a way to confront some longstanding 20th century practices and challenge the status quo. One way of accomplishing this was through the creation of a P-20 Educational Campus. Was the district, merely by their intentions and subsequent actions, able to truly innovate the way in which they conceptualized and reconceptualized schooling in the development of the P-20 Campus?  How did they âdo schoolâ differently? What specifically were the innovations and how significant were they?This study examined the conception and significance of specific innovations within the creation of the P-20 Educational Campus through case study methodology to tell the story of how this Colorado school district approached P-20 educational reform.  A mixed methods approach was used from a review of documents, interview responses combined with survey results. Serving as the conceptual framework for this case study, the key product (goods or services), process (production or delivery methods), organizational (organizational structures, practices, or methods), and marketing (design or packaging) innovations were illuminated.The research revealed the most significant innovations as the seamless, aligned P-20 Campus system, academic and career pathways, partnerships, and world languages. These significant innovations were accompanied by postsecondary and workforce readiness (PWR), new instructional technologies, the Campus leadership model, fluid movement of students, and plans of study.  Specific themes emerged through these innovations:  alignment and coherence, choice, connections, opportunities, partnerships, and 21st century learning.These findings will inform school reformers thinking about how to provide more instructional alignment and coherence toward a seamless, educational system from preschool through postsecondary experiences; to address PWR; and to create critical partnerships among P-12 education, higher education, and the community and industry.It is too soon to tell if these findings were enough to truly reshape the âgrammar of schooling.â  However, when considering innovations in education, these findings revealed the need for systemic structures to promote educational innovation for the 21st Century.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examines what effect the movement towards deeper economic and political integration in the EU has had on the domestic politics of a member country, Britain.  This study argues that this pressure to integrate by joining the single currency, or European Monetary Union (EMU), and its predecessor, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), has exacerbated the cross-cutting cleavages inherent in British party politics, making them potentially dangerous to party unity and to successful governance by making party management more challenging.  The pressure imposed by the EU on British parties and governments to follow the path of economic integration to its fullest extent exacerbates these cross-cutting cleavages in each time period examined in this study, forcing successive British politicians to seek an accommodation between pro- and anti-euro forces in their own parties.In particular this study examines two factors that condition British politicians&apos; reaction to the pressure to join the euro and the impact that the euro cross-cutting cleavage has had on the parties and on British government.  First, formal British political institutions, particularly the size of a ruling party&apos;s parliamentary majority but also the First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system, shape the range of decisions on euro policy available to a political actor.  Second, in keeping with the reiterated problem solving methodology employed in this study, this work considers the role of actors in managing the euro cross-cutting cleavages, especially prime ministers and/or party leaders and how they use their informal powers to manage their party.  Examining how these factors and their interaction with the EU-level integration pressure impacted the decisions Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair, and Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, made regarding euro policy provides insight into what range of options a future prime minister may enjoy when the pressure to integrate rises again.Finally, this work examines the broader repercussions of the EU impetus to deeper integration in other member countries currently struggling to balance the EU-level imperative of economic integration with domestic political realities.  The presence of euroskeptic countries such as Britain gives voice within the EU to alternatives to the dominant imperative to deeper integration whatever the cost.  Thus, Britain&apos;s protracted political agonizing over whether to join the euro has given the country a broader legacy in Europe by making the debate over economic and monetary union a more open and democratic one, allowing this &quot;reluctant European&quot; a key role in shaping the future of the European Union.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Shyness is associated with several emotional, social, and academic problems. While there are multiple difficulties that often accompany shyness, there appear to be some factors that can moderate negative effects of shyness. Research has demonstrated that certain parenting factors affect the adjustment of shy children in early childhood, but there is minimal research illuminating the effect of parenting factors in older age groups. The first purpose of this study was to examine relationships between shyness and loneliness, social anxiety, and school liking. The second purpose was to investigate whether the quality of the relationship between a parent and a 10- to 15-year-olds child influences the amount ofloneliness or social anxiety a shy child experiences or how the childfeels about school. Parent-child dyads served as participants andwere recruited from public and private middle schools and churchyouth groups in Colorado and Indiana. Child participants completedseveral self-report surveys regarding their relationship with a parent,shyness, loneliness, social anxiety, and their attitude toward school.Parents completed a survey about their relationship with their childand responded to questions related to their perceptions of theirchild&apos;s shyness. Data was analyzed with a series of correlation andregression analyses. Greater degrees of self-reported shynesswere found to be associated with higher levels of loneliness andsocial anxiety and less positive feelings about school. Due to aproblem with multicollinearity during data analysis, this study wasnot able to explore the effect of the parent-child relationship qualityon the associations between shyness and adjustment factors.Overall, these findings imply that shyness remains an importantissue as children approach adolescence. Further research isneeded to continue learning about the potential importance ofparent-child interactions in reducing maladjustment for shy childrenduring late childhood.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This quantitative study investigated student and faculty attitudes toward use of Digital Media Technology (DMT) at the University of Denver.  The purpose was to understand how and why students and faculty used DMT on campus. Uses and gratifications theory (Katz, Blumler, &amp; Gurevitch, 1974) was used as the theoretical model to interpret and understand Millennial college students&apos; DMT use, Langer and Knefelcamp&apos;s (2008) College student technology arc was used as a conceptual model. Two survey instruments were designed: one for faculty and one for students to collect data on DMT use and attitudes toward use, satisfaction, skill, and learning at DU.The survey reached 10,404 students, and 1,218 responded to the survey, Completed surveys totaled 1,033, which resulted in a response rate of 10%. The faculty survey reached 294 full, associate, and assistant professors on campus, and resulted in 20% response rate (n=59). Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, correlations, ANOVA, t-tests, and chi square. Nine factors emerged as relevant aspects of DMT use on campus (1) General use, (2) Use for learning, (3) BlackBoard skills, (4) Satisfaction with resources, (5) Social networking, (6) WebCentral skills, (7) Attitudes toward use, (8) DMT efficiency, and (9) Satisfaction with library resources. DMT was used constantly for personal use (64.6%), rather than educational (44.3%). The Attitudes Toward Use factor was highly correlated with Use for Learning (.642) and DMT efficiency (.584) factors. Both the Student (66.2%) and Faculty (66.7%) populations indicated they were mostly self-taught users of DMT. Chi square test examined individual use of faculty and student ownership/use of DMT and found that faculty owned more PC, Tablets, and e-Book Readers compared to students. However, Faculty had a lower mean (2.89) for Use for Learning compared to Students (3.16). The General Use factor was statistically significant indicating a slight difference between student generational cohorts, however, the lower mean (3.35) for Non-Millennials, versus the 1986-1989 (3.52) cohort difference was only .17, and was not considered meaningful. Overall, results demonstrated that the Millennial generation did not report any meaningful differences in their use of technology compared to other student generational cohorts at DU.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation explores Chinese communication practices. I focus on the performance of intercultural communication and how the &quot;New Face&quot; of China was performed to the world and in day-to-day intercultural communication encounters during the 2008 Olympics. I analyze the Olympic Volunteer Training Manual as performative text as well as interviewed Beijing Olympic volunteers about their encounters with international visitors. Specifically, I discuss why the Olympics were a crucial moment for China to unveil its &quot;New Face&quot; to the world, what the &quot;New Face&quot; of China entails, and the reasons why China is in need of a new image on the world stage. I argue that we need to use Chinese concepts and conceptualizations to understand the cultural context, political climate, and deeply complex historical foundations China has when we question Chinese communication practices and performances. I reconceptualize the concept of face with Performance theory to show how the presentation of &quot;New China&quot; and the &quot;New Face of China&quot; during the Olympics was a performance based on &quot;harmony&quot; and the Confucian values of ren (humanism) and li (ritual propriety). Furthermore, I concentrate on how the &quot;New Face&quot; of China and harmony were actually performed by Olympic volunteers on the ground in both public and hidden transcripts. While the Volunteer Training Manual works to performatively generate an image of New China, volunteers on the ground doing intercultural communication that they had learned during training sessions also generated an image of China on the ground, contrary to images in the U.S. imaginary, and in day to day encounters. Although China went to great efforts to present China as a harmonious society, on the ground we see that within harmony there is difference (in communication, performance, and practice) and negotiation through the struggles of everyday life Chinese deal with. More importantly, we find new possibilities and yearnings for peaceful coexistence.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the process of psychotherapy with adolescents in group psychotherapy, assessing the adolescents&apos; motivation to change behaviors, also called stage of change beliefs, and how these relate to the quality of the relationship, or working alliance, between the adolescent and therapist.  Adolescent ratings of group cohesiveness were also measured.  Twenty participants between the ages of 13 and 18 receiving group treatment in an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) at a psychiatric hospital in Colorado were included in the study.  The IOP group targeted parents and adolescents and implemented a manualized treatment to improve family communication and adolescent functioning.   The group met for five weeks with three sessions per week.  Assessment measures utilized included the Ohio Scales, the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form Revised (WAI-SR), and the Group Climate Questionnaire-Short (GCQ-S).  Participants completed the WAI-SR and GCQ-S four times to measure working alliance development and group cohesion.  The URICA was administered at the beginning and end of the IOP group to measure the participants&apos; stage of change beliefs.   Data were analyzed with profile analyses, independent sample t-tests, and Pearson product moment correlations.  Participants improved in overall functioning with decreased problem severity ratings during the group.  Working alliance and group cohesion were shown to be correlated during the second half of the IOP group.  Working alliance and stage of change beliefs were not correlated.  Working alliance ratings did not increase significantly over time.  Parent and adolescent ratings of the adolescents&apos; stage of change beliefs at the beginning and end of the IOP group were not correlated.  Adolescents with previous mental health treatment rated their stage of change as Precontemplation most often while those with no prior mental health treatment rated stage of change as Preparation or Action.  Overall, these findings suggest that brief group treatment may improve adolescent functioning and decrease their ratings of problem severity.  Also significant for adolescent group psychotherapy research is the relatedness of working alliance and group cohesion.  Further research is needed to learn how stages of change beliefs affect adolescents and how the working alliance develops in psychotherapy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation study examined the relationship between vicarious traumatization and job retention among 1,192 child welfare professionals in five different child welfare organizations.  Propositions from Constructivist Self Development Theory (CSDT) were utilized to examine the differential factors influencing the impact of vicarious trauma on child welfare professionals&apos; intent to leave their organization, including coping strategies, professional efficacy, and professional satisfaction.  Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to assess the degree of fit between the observed data and several hypothesized theoretical models examining the relationship between vicarious trauma, coping strategies, professional efficacy, professional satisfaction, and retention.  Findings from SEM analyses revealed a significant relationship between vicarious traumatization and intent to leave, as mediated by professional efficacy and professional satisfaction.  This finding indicated that child welfare professionals who experienced higher rates of vicarious traumatization were more likely to leave their organization.  Implications of these findings for theory, research, and social work practice are delineated.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Technology-based education is learning primarily based in constructivist styled pedagogies. It is neither good nor bad; its value is inherent to the user and environment where it is placed. While some churches place a high value on the benefits gleaned from its use, others abhor it in religious education.Why churches incorporate or reject technology-based education is a phenomenon that baffles most educators because the logic invoked is neither sound nor empirical. Either way, technology continues to evolve in education circles beyond the walls of the local church. In order to preserve the historical traditions and the distinctive cultures of their organizations, many churches have refrained from using information and communication technologies for educational purposes. Instead, technology is relegated to office functions and sermon preparation practices. However, through the provisioning of grants, restructuring of budgets, and the generosity of alumni, theological schools have implemented information and communication technologies to expand their reach into religious education markets. In religious education, a divide exists between leaders and laity regarding educational development. Education for clergy adheres to guidelines prescribed by their respective religious bodies; however, lay education is local, traditionally non-formal, synchronous, and unregulated.Traditionally, pastors consign ecclesiastical ministry to laity similar to the way parents relegate care giving to the eldest child. The primary considerations prior to prescribing responsibility are spiritual maturity, time served, and potential. Formal training and prior participation in the ministry are additional factors. In terms of educational development, clergy and laity differ in information and communication technologies use.This research seeks to understand and report the manner in which information and communication technologies (ICT) are used within a local church. This report is a review of the qualitative data on the education offered and the pedagogical practices of ICT used in teaching and development of laity.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>To Get the Shot or Not? Narratives, Rhetoric, and the Childhood Vaccination Controversy</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Parents in developed countries like the United States are questioning the need for and safety of childhood vaccinations. Incidences of disease have risen as fewer parents have vaccinated their children. Perhaps the most significant public figure to reinforce the choices of parents not-to-vaccinate is Jenny McCarthy, whose best-selling book details her theory about the cause of, and cure for, her son&apos;s autism. As I demonstrate, the study of the narratives is vital for understanding the vaccination crisis, not the least because of the extent to which McCarthy&apos;s (2007) story has echoed through parenting communities. I examine whether chosen anti- and pro-vaccination narratives meet the requirements of Fisher&apos;s (1984) narrative paradigm. In addition, I examine how the narratives might promote a sense of identification with audience members, particularly in how the narrators deal with a sense of guilt about the condition of their children (Burke, 1969). Further, I concentrate on both the functional nature of these narratives and on the constitutive components. The public is clearly divided on the vaccination issue. As I argue, this division may well come down to the way in which these distinct narratives constitute audiences differently, constitutions that both encourage people to act in particular ways through a sense of identification, and also outline the boundaries of what it means to be a &quot;good&quot; parent, such that one may be more swayed, consciously or unconsciously, by one type of narrative than another. Finally, I examine how the narratives deal with the conflict between personal choice and the public good. This dissertation also addresses the question of how to make Fisher&apos;s paradigm a powerful tool for the rhetorical analysis of narratives. As I argue, focusing more explicitly than has previously been done on the Burkean (1969a, 1969b) concept of identification and including Burke&apos;s guilt/purification/redemption cycle in the analysis of narratives, we begin to see why stories that &quot;should&quot; be rejected by readers for failing to achieve the requirements of the narrative paradigm become widely accepted instead. In addition, this dissertation contributes to the field of communication, particularly health communication.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Trends in Heavy-Duty Diesel Emissions and Analyses of Colorado&apos;s Light-Duty Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Emission trends are reported and discussed resulting from the multi-year study of Heavy-Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDV) at the Port of Los Angeles and at a weigh station in Peralta also in the L.A. basin.  Remote sensing data were also collected from the Port of Houston and compared to the data from California.  As part of San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP) to fast track the turnover rate of cleaner trucks, many truck operators have been subject to modifying their trucks, or have purchased new trucks, with more advanced control technologies to reduce exhaust particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  These advanced control technologies have been proven to effectively reduce these emissions but have some unwanted effects such as increasing the NO2/NO ratio in diesel exhaust which has the potential to increase ground level ozone. Ammonia (NH3) was found to be an unexpected product from one of the new control technologies as almost all the NOx is reduced to NH3.  In addition to the HDDV comparison, two years worth of emissions records from Colorado&apos;s light-duty fleet Inspection Maintenance (I/M) program were matched and compared with the on-road measurements.  This analysis shows that switching to an On-Board Diagnostics only program would cost 5-8 times as much as the currently used dynamometer tests and achieve only a fraction of emissions benefit from the current I/M program.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Who&apos;s Doing the Dirty Work? Development and Preliminary Validation of a Measure of Housework</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The present study developed a new instrument for measuring couples&apos; attitudes and behaviors regarding housework. This study was conducted in two phases. The first phase focused on developing reliable subscales that would reflect various dimensions of housework. Phase one consisted of 199 individual participants in committed relationships who were working at least 20 hours per week and shared a single home address with their partner. Participants answered questions related to housework through an online survey. An exploratory factors analysis (EFA) revealed eight dominant factors from the housework questionnaire, labeled as: 1) Fairness, 2) Value of Housework, 3) Gender Role Attitudes, 4) Hiring Outside Help, 5) Showing Appreciation, 6) Conflict over Housework, 7) Enjoyment of Housework, and 8) Personal Standards of Housework. The second phase examined the validity of the new measure by testing a set of hypotheses while also exploring gender differences related to various dimensions of housework. Phase two consisted of 103 couple participants in which both partners were working at least 20 hours per week and shared a single home address. Participants completed an online survey, which consisted of the newly developed housework measure, as well as other questionnaires aimed at assessing overall relationship quality. Several important themes emerged from the findings. First, females&apos; perceptions about housework are more informative about overall relationship quality than males&apos; perceptions. Second, perceived fairness matters more than housework equality in terms of predicting overall satisfaction with housework. Furthermore, for women, housework satisfaction matters more than fairness in predicting overall relationship satisfaction; for men, both fairness and satisfaction with the division of housework were important in predicting overall relationship quality. Third, relative resources predict housework allocations such that when the male earns more, the female does more of the housework and when the female earns more, the male does more of the housework; furthermore, partners with relatively equal earnings share the housework equally. Finally, traditional patterns are still very apparent, especially once couples have children. Implications and contributions of the present study are discussed, as well as areas for future research related to housework.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The intent of this research study was to determine the types of workplace pressures that PK-8 teachers, in a Midwestern Archdiocese, experience.  Two hundred eighty teachers participated in the survey. Results from this study indicate that PK-8 teachers express elevated levels of stress in the following areas:  income/salary, amount of hours spent outside contract hours on instructional tasks, paperwork required, student behavior/discipline, and implementation of new curricula.Statistical differences were found in the following areas: female and male stress levels with regard to income; school locale (suburban, urban, and rural) income stress levels; school locale (suburban, urban, and rural) implementation of new curricula stress levels; school locale (suburban, urban, and rural) paperwork stress levels.Reasons teachers report for wanting to leave their job include salary/benefits, dislike of administration, lack of administrative support, and excessive demands outside of contract hours.  Reasons for wanting to stay include that their job offers an increase in pay/salary, relationships with coworkers, and the students that they teach.Teachers and administrators must be aware of workplace pressures and make necessary adjustments.  If schools know how to manage and identify workplace pressures a better school climate can be achieved.</dc:description>
