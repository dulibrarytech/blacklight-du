  <dc:description>Museums collect and care for material culture, and, increasingly, intangible culture. This relatively new term for the folklore, music, dance, traditional practices, and language belonging to a group of people is gaining importance in international heritage management discourse. As one aspect of intangible cultural heritage, language is more relevant in museums than one might realize. Incorporating native languages into museum collections provides context and acts as appropriate museology, preserving indigenous descriptions of objects. Hopi katsina tihu are outstanding examples of objects that museums can re-contextualize with native terminology. Their deep connection to Hopi belief and ritual as well as their diverse origins are part of the etymology of katsina names, which can be inaccurate of simplified in museum catalogs. I consulted historic ethnographies and the Hopi Dictionary to create a database of Hopi katsina tihu names, demonstrating how museums might incorporate intangible heritage into their collections through language and etymological context.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&quot;A Response to Aid Dependency: Service for Aid&quot; by Angela Bennett is a composition reviewing literature on humanitarian assistance and aid dependency.  She appraises current programs which delivery humanitarian assistance by utilizing reward incentives for participation in social programs in order to combat dependency on outside sources of support.  The author uses her experience as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Dominican Republic for examples of expectance on aid. The Service for Aid model is proposed as a new approach to humanitarian aid delivery, requiring recipients to participate in capacity and capability building programs in order to earn aid in the form of a complementary currency.  The earning of credit in the form a complementary currency will stem dependency, and provide sustainable routes to development for disadvantaged communities. The work is divided into two parts, Part I is the theoretical overview of the issue of aid dependency and incentive-based programs aimed at creating behavior change; Part II is a program proposal which implements the Service for Aid model and furthermore is the author&apos;s response to aid dependency.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Interviews with eight bullying prevention program directors from around the country reveal the extent to which research findings are reflected in bullying prevention programs currently in operation. Framed as a list of best practices for coeducational and gender-specific bullying prevention curricula, the purpose of the present thesis was to document the most positive contributions made by various approaches to bullying prevention programs to the overall field, and to highlight practices of programs that reflect insight into what is known about gender differences in bullying. Best practicesincluded new approaches to empathy-building, service-learning, confidentiality, cyberbullying, positive reinforcement, reporting  systems and youth-driven programming.This thesis will demonstrate that only some bullying prevention programs take advantage of scholarly knowledge by incorporating recent findings into their curricula. The results demonstrate that while many programs incorporate known literature about bullying into their programs--resulting in positive contributions to the field--others may be applying potentially harmful practices. Research findings also revealed that new best practices were present in programs regardless of status as a gender-specific or coeducational audience.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>An Empirical Evaluation of the Effectiveness of JML Assertions as Test Oracles</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Test oracles remain one of the least understood aspects of the moderntesting process. An oracle is a mechanism used by software testers andsoftware engineers for determining whether a test has passed orfailed. One widely-supported approach to oracles is the use of runtimeassertion checking during the testing activity. Method invariants,pre- and postconditions help detect bugs during runtime. Whileassertions are supported by virtually all programming environments,are used widely in practice, and are often assumed to be effective astest oracles, there are few empirical studies of their efficacy inthis role. In this thesis, we present the results of an experiment weconducted to help understand this question. To do this, we studiedseven of the core Java classes that had been annotated by others withassertions in the Java Modeling Language, used the muJava mutationanalysis tool to create mutant implementations of these classes,exercised them with input-only (i.e., no oracle) test suites thatachieve branch coverage, and used a machine learning tool, Weka, todetermine which annotations were effective at ``killing&apos;&apos; thesemutants. We also evaluate how effective the ``null oracle&apos;&apos; (in ourcase, the Java runtime system) is at catching these bugs. The resultsof our study are interesting, and help provide software engineers withinsight into situations in which assertions can be relied upon to findbugs, and situations in which assertions may need to be augmented withother approaches to test oracles.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Analysis and Design of a Feedback Controlled Adaptive Pneumatic Cast</dc:title>

  <dc:description>A pneumatic system with PID control for an actively controlled cast is designed.  The cast is intended to aid healing of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving pressure from the sole of a patient&apos;s foot and distributing it to the calf.  This is accomplished by a pneumatic system which maintains set pressure in multiple air bladders.  The research began by defining an electrical circuit analogous to a single supply subsystem.  Tests are performed to determine the coefficients for each component.  These coefficients are used in a mathematical model to better understand the response of the system to pressure input.  A controller is designed for a single subsystem using Ziegler-Nichols first method as a starting point.  PID control is extended to each configuration option.  Control theory is used to determine an optimal configuration of the bladder subsystems.  Series, parallel, and a hybrid configuration are considered.  The cost, complexity, and performance of each configuration is used in a weighted decision matrix to choose the best configuration.  The parallel configuration is chosen as the optimal solution.  Because the pump used in the design is capable of supplying all air bladders simultaneously, the parallel configuration can be simplified to a single subsystem.  The model of the subsystem is validated against physical tests.  The controller driving the single supply subsystem is used as a guideline for designing a modified duty cycle controller.  This controller is implemented using simple pneumatic and electrical components.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Asset Distribution and Productivity:  Best Practices for Developing this Synergistic Relationship</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Productivity is an essential component of lasting corporate success.  It is also a critical ingredient in the recipe for making a vibrant and prosperous community.Economics recognizes that both capital and labor make contributions to productivity through the functions of investment and production.  Enhancements to productivity can be obtained in multiple areas, including technological advancement, corporate expansion, market penetration, and product development.  Sustained productivity growth, however, is predicated upon continual process improvement and market innovation.Identifying precisely &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; are contributing to productivity is challenging.  Because capital and labor interact, it is difficult to determine whether the positive effect is due to the man or the machine.  Evaluating the contributions of labor alone is complicated, as people are productive both as individuals and in working together as a group.  It is hard to imagine a situation where a competitive advantage is obtained without cooperation.  Nevertheless, economics is theoretically geared toward atomistic contributions to productivity.Making any significant achievement within a corporation or community requires input from a variety of entities having a willingness to commit their time and energy to a particular effort.  Because the path to improvement involves making mistakes and learning-by-doing, patience is involved.  Often short-term gratification must be sacrificed for long-term gain; incurring costs today in the hope of revenues tomorrow.  This trade-off affects both costs and profits.  Because short-term profits are the predominant incentive for investment capital, and marginal costs are the key determinant of wages, favorable behaviors on either the investment or production front are not automatically rewarded.  Attention must be given to asset development, if incentives are to be structured properly.In this paper, I emphasize the importance of using specific asset-based methods and financial tools to fairly and efficiently distribute contributions to productivity.  Corporations will find these methods equally desirable because they can be used to generate low-cost, highly-accessible finance capital.  These incentive structures include the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), as well as other financial instruments that are built upon the foundation of the ESOP.  These include the CSOP (Customer Stock Ownership Plan), the CIC (Community Investment Corporation), and the CHA (Capital Homesteading Account).Although these variations of the ESOP address a wide variety of situations, they have yet to be tax-qualified like the ESOP.  I am hopeful that this will change.  To cover the landscape of what is available right now, however, the structures that include the Community Development Corporation (CDC), the Community Land Trust (CLT), and the Individual Development (IDA) are investigated.Because the future prosperity of individuals, corporations, and communities depends upon continuous improvement and innovation, contributions to productivity are of primary importance.  Just as important is the creation of a life and work environment that is competitive, efficient, and fair.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The security and social inequality approaches to public health present distinct answers to policy objectives relative to a pandemic. However, each approach leaves us with tough choices between the most valued objectives. I demonstrate how the networked approach, which Kettl‟s Rocket Science Model (RSM) exemplifies, does not leave us with such choices. Furthermore, I connect the epidemiological concepts public health practitioners apply toward communicable disease pandemics to RSM concepts. Finally, drawing on the disease parameters of a worst-case scenario influenza pandemic, I demonstrate how the networked approach helps public health practitioners expand capacity such that tough choices are unnecessary.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>For Byron, the knowledge that he would one day have to become old was always on his mind. By the time Byron had relocated to the Continent, the idea had become something of an obsession. Thirty had always been Byron&apos;s turning point, the age at which youth would have to end and he would have to become an old man. Upon finally reaching that age, Byron found himself in a place much like Dante&apos;s &lt;italic&gt;selva oscura&lt;/italic&gt;--dark, confusing, fearful, but with no other way left to go. There are allusions to this opening scene throughout &lt;italic&gt;Don Juan&lt;/italic&gt;. It is in that work, begun in 1818, the year he turned thirty, that Byron plays out his journey through midlife on the page and truly confronts what it means to transition from youth to age. The composition of &lt;italic&gt;Don Juan&lt;/italic&gt; took place over five years in two distinct periods: Cantos I-V from July 1818 to November 1820, and Cantos VI-XVII from April 1822 to May 1823, with an intervening sixteen-month hiatus. In the early cantos (I-V), Juan is a means through which Byron can revisit and reevaluate his youth; through Juan Byron can indulge nostalgia for his youth and mourn its passing. The later cantos (VI-XVII), however, reflect a change in Byron. They show an increase in digression and Byron&apos;s intrusion into the narrative. As he makes his way through his midlife crisis, the task of reliving his youth through Juan loses importance and the plot takes on a supporting role. As early as Canto VII Byron begins to speak of transcendence (VII.1-2) and by Canto X has decided that he is ready to embark on that journey (X.4), as Juan seems poised to follow Aurora into the heavens, as Dante made it through Purgatory to follow Beatrice to God.By the time Byron reaches thirty-five he appears to be well on his way out of the crisis and into mature adulthood; Juan, the manifestation of his lost youth, is on the verge of manhood himself, whether it be achieved through marriage in English society or the philosophical influence of Aurora.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This research focused on the detrimental effects of climate change on indigenous peoples in Latin America. Indigenous peoples throughout the region tend to live subsistence livelihoods, which tie them closely to their land and the surrounding environment. This close relationship often means that indigenous peoples acutely experience the effects of climate change and are more susceptible to its negative outcomes than other populations. Further, indigenous peoples in the region lack the mitigation and adaptation capacities to deal with damaging climatic effects.This research was designed to view the impacts of climate change on indigenous peoples through a human rights framework, focusing on the difficulties of resource allocation and management due to climatic shifts. Methods of critique were applied to international responses to climate issues. The research clearly shows the enhanced ways in which indigenous peoples are affected by climate change and that their circumstances inform their thoughts on both the problem and possible solutions. These perspectives are significant and should be more readily considered in international climate discourse.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study investigated students&apos; responses to released TIMSS mathematics items and considered what those responses might show about participants&apos; mastery level of cognitive areas.  The least squares distance method (LSDM) was used in this cognitive diagnostic analysis. There were 4,498 8th-grade students from seven geographical regions of Turkey who took TIMSS items. In this study, using the responses of Turkish students to the released math items of TIMSS-2007, an IRT analysis was also conducted to both compare results with international item parameters A Pearson correlation between these two sets of item logit positions produced a correlation of r = .82, and this correlation represents a high degree of relationship and so overall consistency in item logit position.Results indicated that the majority of the items can be well explained by a set of 20 attributes (mean MAD = .075; r = .68). As a result of this study, educators in Turkey should note that students have weaker knowledge in geometry, graphics, charts, figures, rule application in algebra, and data management and stronger skills with.  The results of the present study can help teachers and curriculum developers ensure that the utilized educational policies and methodologies would help students to improve their cognitive mastery levels in general.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Composing music with computers in constrained search environments adds complexities and problems not present in the traditional problem domain of generative music.  The traditional and well researched mechanisms of Markov chains, genetic algorithms and data driven rule based systems do not directly map to a problem domain in which pitch choice and rhythm choice are likely to be highly limited.We therefore explore several possible solutions to generating rhythms in extremely constrained environments with the goal of generating music that adheres to user specified constraints and is aesthetically pleasing.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>CREATIVITY WITH PUREST ENERGY--HOW SIR THOMAS WYATT INTRODUCED MODERN ENGLISH POETICS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The court poetry of Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-42) asserts a special confidence and boldness of the individual and his poetics that stand at the forefront of an ambitious, sure and powerful England which eventually came into place during his life and afterwards.  Wyatt marks the start of a new literary period when humanity and art gradually diverged from religious rites and instruction, dramatic impulses for romantic love and mere desires for adventure, allegory and narrative to favor instead modern demands and conscious intellectualism.  Wyatt&apos;s poetry best represents this distinct literary break from his native medieval predecessors and from writers who had already been challenged on the European Continent by the renaissance which began there about a century ahead of England&apos;s.Transmitting and revising poetry from Italy, France and elsewhere, Wyatt introduced numerous poetic forms to England.  Then, by experimenting with these new metrical forms and using native vernacular, he originated his own poetry.  Wyatt&apos;s poetry also began to reflect a new attitude about human life, an attitude reflecting the flourishing of classical authorities somewhat at odds with old ideas.  His early modern poetics would exceed beyond medieval literature&apos;s propensity for rhyme and the harsh depiction of nature&apos;s realities.  Instead, he would offer an alternative to philosophic depth and poetic virtuosity that was mastered by Chaucer and imitated by others in England and on the European Continent.  His would be a transformative kind of poetry, more direct and less narrative, in new and &quot;irregular&quot; prosody.  And Wyatt&apos;s &quot;new&quot; poetry uniquely combined native traditions and classical influences in radically different tones and from ordered meters that did not restrict--actually, which served as a catalyst for--lyrical variations, prosodic innovations, and quite different and highly aesthetic expressions about universal truths and humanity&apos;s new-found boldness and intellect that was taking hold in Tudor England.Wyatt&apos;s court-poet contemporaries and then successive poets like Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne to name only a few, would acknowledge the poetics that Wyatt first introduced and that they then improved upon in their own poetry to establish what is well-known as the Early Modern eras&apos; best lyrics.  However, without the clear voice and innovations by Wyatt, that new path in British life and literature undoubtedly would not have been advanced, at least not in the first half of the sixteenth century.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study considers how inter-tribal Indian identity formed though historic circumstances and how it is negotiated and maintained by contemporary Native Americans.  Specifically, it considers identity formation and negotiation through the inter-tribal dance event, powwow.  Further, it considers how and if men and women participate in this identity formation and negotiation differently.  Finally, it considers how this identity is useful for urban Indian populations living outside of tribal lands and who, in some cases, have little involvement in more traditional, or tribal, settings.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The goal of this study is to establish a more applied, analytical approach to analyses of collective identity and violence while providing insights into the dynamics of the regions of Indonesia considered.  By focusing on two regions of Indonesia - Aceh and Kalimantan - which are populated by distinct peoples and have experienced violence in contemporary times, this study contributes to the expanding literature on the social dynamics of identity and violence.  To ensure a more practical approach within the study, concepts and frameworks which have contributed to discussions of the nature of identity and acts of violence are utilized.  The work of Brubaker and Cooper (2000) provides a foundational understanding of identity which is complemented by Gurr and Bishop&apos;s (1976) study of diverse forms of physical and structural violence.  Through a fusion of the authors&apos; conceptualizations and terminology, a coherent understanding and approach to the case studies is developed for the evaluation of identities and violence in Aceh and the Western and Central provinces of Kalimantan.  These case studies provide the opportunity to evaluate the influence which identity has had upon violence in two regions which have experienced eruptions of violence seemingly motivated by different values and aspirations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since the suburban rush and steep rise in household technological devices in the mid-twentieth century, Americans have drawn apart from each other, a shift that has coincided with a rise in both dog ownership and the adoption of handheld mobile devices.  This paper argues that these phenomena, which are both ubiquitous and intimate in many American households, reflect one of the most basic and static human needs: the need for emotional connection.  Furthermore, it is the unique combination of canine and digital elements that replace human-to-human social networks; networks that were once both literally and figuratively tightly drawn.  In the plainest terms, handheld devices endow people with powers of digital communication, thereby infolding them into a cybernetic social network.  Meanwhile, it falls to dogs to provide a physical embodiment of a more immediate and tactile connection.  In the most complicated terms, the human/digital/canine relationship in its many iterations is fraught with seemingly contradictory nuances, surprising connections, and theoretically diverse approaches.  Drawing from a wide base of existing research and literature, both in the realm of human/technological and human/canine relationships, this paper seeks to draw new conclusions about how we interact with our devices and our dogs and what this might say about who we are.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In 1942, approximately 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were evacuated from the West Coast to ten different internment camps in the interior of the United States. One of these camps was the Granada Relocation Center, otherwise known as Amache, located in southeastern Colorado. Through the analysis of archaeological material, archival documents, and oral histories, this thesis explores the experiences of Japanese American women interned at Amache. Feminine identity was greatly changed and redefined during confinement. These changes in feminine identity are examined in the public and private arenas of daily life within confinement. The construction of new and altered individual and community identities are also explored. By examining how feminine identity was both changed as well as maintained during confinement, many differences between generations of Japanese women are exposed. Commonalities and similarities are also revealed that ultimately highlight the great adaptability, resilience, and perseverance of Japanese women in confinement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since colonial contact, indigenous peoples have been predominantly represented by community outsiders. As a result, native peoples have rarely had a primary, or even collaborative role, in the production of these representations. However, in the last two decades, there has been an unprecedented proliferation of indigenous created films and the festivals that feature them. The Denver Indigenous Arts and Film Festival is an annual festival that exclusively showcases films made by and with indigenous peoples. The festival&apos;s 2009 theme of &quot;Telling Our Stories&quot; emphasized cultural control of representation and the transmission of traditional knowledge. In this thesis, I show that unlike ethnographic filmmakers, indigenous filmmakers have been able to critically engage issues of identity due to their personal connection to home communities. Furthermore, many indigenous filmmakers, having had complex bicultural life experiences, are positioned to express hybrid identities relevant to the contemporary challenges of native communities. Based on research I conducted throughout 2009 with the Denver festival, this thesis explores ways in which indigenous filmmakers have expressed these issues through their films and audience interactions. The festival itself is discussed as a locus of identity discourse, comprising many commonalities as well as key differences in relation to other indigenous film festivals.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Fraternities and sororities have been fixtures of American collegiate campuses since the founding of Phi Beta Kappa in 1776. Since that time the wants, needs, aspirations and desires of the college student has continually evolved. In an effort to keep up with the evolution of the student, Greek-letter organizations (GLOs) have needed to find ways of evolving as well. As we jump head-first into the 21st century and beyond these great bastions of the collegiate experience are again in need of a face-lift to meet the needs of the latest generation of students. Now, more than ever, it is time for GLOs to get back to their true roots and find a way to accentuate the values that they represent. It is also important to work towards diminishing the negative aspects often associated with membership within these organizations, bringing congruence between their exposed and enacted values. This thesis presents a model designed to help GLOs evolve into hybrid organizations with close ties to living-learning communities, while still holding onto their individual identities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Coffee is an important commodity for Central American countries.  Like other agricultural production, coffee production in the region is undergoing a &quot;feminization&quot; in which women become the primary producers.  However, female agricultural producers face constraints that their male counterparts do not.  This study analyzes policies to determine if they promote or continue the inhibition of empowerment of female coffee producers.  The results of the study indicate that policies relating to Central American coffee production are promoting women&apos;s empowerment, but implementation remains weak.  Policy recommendations are included.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The goal of this research is to provide a more in depth understanding of the greenbuilding landscape in Denver, Colorado than was previously available.  The past andpresent of sustainable structures as well as the vernacular architecture of the region areanalyzed in order to make useful projections about the future of the city and its buildingsand potential planning policies.  In conducting this analysis, methods utilized includecase studies, histories, archival research, as well as a brief spatial analysis that outlinesthe extent of current green building trends in Denver.  As a result of this research, it isdivulged that there is a distinct difference between producing and achievingsustainability.  It is seen that the vernacular traditions of the past achieved sustainabilityby choosing local, durable materials.  An alarming trend is found in which the LEEDcertification process seemingly relies too heavily upon innovative technology andimported resources that produce sustainability rather than achieve it.  It is hoped thatthrough this research arises a better appreciation of vernacular architecture and traditionalbuilding elements.  Ultimately this research proposes that learning from the past may bethe best way to ensure the future of sustainable cities through the implementation of trulygreen buildings.  We do not need to learn how to be sustainable, but simply remember.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Agriculture has dominated the economy of many developing countries for centuries, which has led to development policies that center on agricultural development. An obvious approach to improved production is to decrease agricultural losses in the fields and increase efficiency to markets. This study focuses on the developmental role of pesticides and chemical fertilizers on non-traditional agricultural export farming and the adoption of IPM techniques. With farmers in the Comayagua Valley of Honduras, an Asian vegetable production center for the country, as the study population, the costs and benefits of planting oriental vegetables was examined. Statistical analysis was used to examine factors contributing to a farmer&apos;s decision whether or not to adopt integrated pest management techniques. Agricultural practices and economic data were compiled through personal surveys. Farm locations were tagged using a GPS handheld unit for distance modeling. Despite a small study sample some observations were made. Chemical cost accounted for more than 50% of the expected return and correlations were found between land access and the use of fixed traps and barriers. Observations made during this study have indicated areas and directions for future studies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The main question posed in my thesis is whether or not the crossroads is a paradigm that might open the event of reading and interpretation. I believe this profound place of possibility is a valid intellectual model for innovative and uninhabited modes of understanding. The hermeneutics of the crossroads is an imaginative approach that keeps us open to the transformative power of literature transpiring when we bring to the text our working scholarly knowledge, but also allow ourselves to receive what it has to offer us.Using the crossroads theory of surrendering and receiving, I have interpreted Gayl Jones&apos;s novel, Corregidora, in this spirit. In Chapter 1, I briefly examine historical aspects in Blues creation and evolution, and how this relates to Jones&apos;s novel. Chapter 2, I perform my hermeneutical interpretive posture. And finally, in Chapter 3, I place myself in the center of possibility within Hoodoo culture, in order to personally discover how this revered, yet often overlooked, culture speaks to and through Blues, literature, and the crossroads.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>While members of the southern Sudanese Dinka tribe converted to Christianity in large numbers in the early 1990s, the Lost Boys, a largely Dinka group of young men who were separated from their families during the Sudanese civil war in the late 1980s, had a distinct conversion experience in refugees camps.  Using first-person interviews and participant observation with a group of Lost Boys resettled in Denver, and historical and ethnographic data, this research seeks to explain why the Lost Boys converted to Christianity and the role that it played in their identity in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, and continues to play in their lives in Denver. Findings include the Lost Boys&apos; need to adapt to radically changed circumstances that separated them from the central components of their lives--their families, villages, and cattle--and retention of the Dinka values of pragmatism and group autonomy, which allowed the Lost Boys to accept the once foreign practice of Christianity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Organizations experience the bottom line impact of internal conflictsdaily. Conflicts between employees simply drain organizational resources. The idea of Integrated Conflict Management Systems (ICMS) has been introduced to help minimize the impact of these conflicts. ICMS, through the development of policies and procedures to address conflicts, are actually attempting to change the organization&apos;s culture, and when organizations attempt cultural changes, conflicts are likely to occur. The primary component of cultural change is the organizational leader.The study interviews organizational leaders about the conflicts that occur when organizations change cultures and the methods that leaders use to work through those conflicts. One finding was that though leaders viewed most conflicts as relational, they may in fact be values onflicts requiring different interventions. The study found that leaders identified three primary components for dealing with conflict during hange. They are dialogue, one-on-one conversations, and direct and consistent messaging.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis is intended to identify the distinctive traits of Syrian leadership.  Its purpose is to better serve policy makers as they confront the challenges Syria presents.  The first section identifies major research on decision making and leadership analysis.  The second section is an analysis of Syria&apos;s leadership components.  The third section uses several quantitative methods to identify the leadership traits of President Bashar Al-Assad.  A psychological leadership profile of the figurehead creates added complexity to the structural analysis, but is relevant because it has the capability of allowing actual policy makers to deal with their Syrian counterpart.  Bashar Al-Assad is found to be a complex dictator by both Middle Eastern and world standards, who is likely to respond to challenges slowly, and with an eye towards his domestic constituency.  His regime will continue as long as he can find the right balance between reform and conservation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Maritime piracy off the Horn of Africa, although not a new security threat, has grown at an alarming rate in the twenty-first century.  This study compares modern Somali piracy with the Barbary Corsairs problem of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to understand what policy responses might be most effective.  The comparison focused on pirate characteristics and motives; targeted ships; attack frequency; hostage treatment; counter measures to combat piracy; and outcomes.Financial motivation, level of organization, and viciousness of attacks are all characteristics the Somali pirates and Barbary Corsairs share.  They differ in that the Corsairs operated as part of a religious war and were culturally and politically different from current pirates, targeted different types of vessels, and had fleets that consisted of larger, traditional ships.  The lessons learned from Barbary as well as these similarities and differences all contribute to formulating the most viable response to the threat of modern piracy.  The failure of tribute payments and the diplomatic treaties that stipulated for these tribute payments to the Barbary leaders, the success of best safety practices, and the necessity for military action to counter piracy are all important lessons from the Barbary era that can be applied to the current problem of maritime crime.  Military intervention on the high seas is the most viable solution because of the capabilities of the United States Navy that can directly address the threat of piracy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis explores changes that occurred in popular music during the 1960s and early 1970s through case studies involving three significant albums released in 1971 and 1972: Marvin Gaye&apos;s What&apos;s Going On, Sly and the Family Stone&apos;s There&apos;s a Riot Goin&apos; On, and Stevie Wonder&apos;s Talking Book. These albums deserve attention particularly because, as this thesis argues, existing research on the cultural significance of popular music has focused largely on the periods before or after the 1970s and research on music-making technologies has focused largely on white artists or groups from the late 1960s. Addressing this blind spot, the thesis seeks to illuminate this time period and its place as a significant bridge to the digital era that followed.  Moreover, by employing media ecology and practice theory as a framework, the thesis argues that these albums exemplify a cleavage of the recorded musical text from live performance, akin to that of the written text from oral-styled manuscripts to closed literary works.  Drawing upon the tradition of the history and phenomenology of recorded sound, this thesis therefore aims to contribute to media ecological understandings of how human agency, industry structures, and technological affordances worked together to redefine the structures and the relationships with which they were associated.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Kevin Bales, through his study in Understanding Global Slavery:  A Reader, provides an important quantitative analysis on the predictive factors of modern slavery.  Upon examining his study though, several issues arise including too few observations for several of the variables and the lack of a regional variable.  The author decided to rerun his study with replacements for the problematic variables used previously.  Upon obtaining the results from this, the author examined development theory (development is believed to be closely liked to slavery), and began creating an alternative model, which eventually included the addition of a regional variable.  This model differed from Bales&apos;, but showed that region matters in predicting modern slavery and further examination of the regions separated out shows there are differences in what predicts slavery in various regions.  The potential policy implications include targeting appropriate programs in a region to fight the issues might lead to slavery there.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In April of 2008, the Colombian Constitutional Court issued a report based on women&apos;s testimonials that identified gender-specific risks associated with forced displacement as result of armed conflict. This study explores the coping strategies employed by Colombian women to address socio-economic vulnerability and improve living conditions during resettlement in Bogotá. Specifically, the research tracks the process of adaptation during the struggle to achieve economic stability. The findings suggest that a prevailing culture of fear influences multiple aspects of adjusting to the city and constricts the participants&apos; access to new social networks. Lessons gathered from the participants using collaborative anthropological methods have important implications for aid donors who aim to support this vulnerable population. The study is timely because the Colombian government has made progressive attempts to support the internally displaced people, however there has been little qualitative research on the perception of this population, specifically mothers, as to whether this support is reaching them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Calcium ions (Ca2+) are essential signaling molecules and must be carefully regulated to preserve specificity in function.  One indispensible Ca2+ signaling protein is the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channel.  RyR1 is essential for muscle contraction, and RyR1mutations can lead to severe muscle disorders such as malignant hyperthermia (MH).  Recently, a mouse model of human MH (Y522S-RyR1) has been developed.  In skeletal muscle, Y522S-RyR1 exhibits an increased sensitivity to activation resulting in Ca2+ leak, mitochondrial disorganization, and cellular stress.  Although RyR1 expression is limited in the brain, the cerebellum may be particularly vulnerable to this disease because RyR1 is highly expressed in Purkinje neurons.  In this study, Y522S-RyR1 in Purkinje cells exhibits a lower threshold for activation, but does not cause severe cellular stress and damage.  Future investigation of compensatory mechanisms for increased Ca2+ release in Purkinje cells could be of therapeutic value for many neurological and muscular disorders.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&apos;s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have devastating consequences to the afflicted patients. A major cellular pathophysiology underlying these diseases is mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS) leading to neuronal death. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of a novel class of nutraceuticals, anthocyanins, against MOS-induced death in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Anthocyanins are natural antioxidants whose neuroprotective potential has yet to be examined in detail. Kuromanin and callistephin are anthocyanins derived from black rice and strawberries, respectively. Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive MOS and intrinsic apoptosis were induced in CGNs by the Bcl-2 inhibitor, HA14-1. Callistephin and kuromanin each demonstrated significant neuroprotection from this MOS-induced death that was equal to that provided by the green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin 3-gallate; however, neither anthocyanin was as effective as GSH at rescuing CGNs. Incubation with HA14-1 alone resulted in nearly 90% apoptosis of CGNs and either callistephin or kuromanin reduced this effect to approximately 20% cell death. Treatment with HA14-1 caused a marked depletion of mitochondrial GSH in CGNs to approximately 40% of the control level. Callistephin and kuromanin essentially prevented the reduction in this critical pool of endogenous antioxidant. These data indicate that callistephin and kuromanin represent a new class of neuroprotective compounds that warrant further study as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases caused by MOS.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The shifts occurring in the mediascape and the field of public health offer new opportunities for promoting the health and wellness of sexual minority women.  As a population that has historically been underserved by the healthcare system, sexual minority women face multiple barriers to achieving positive health outcomes.  They are often less likely to access preventive healthcare services and more likely to engage in risky behaviors that are detrimental to health than heterosexual women.  Despite the significant health disparities among sexual minority women, studying this population has not been a priority in health research and there is little research-based evidence to guide patient-provider communication or health interventions.  Public health and LGBT advocates have called for further health research on sexual minority women, funding and advocacy to promote their health, and education for healthcare providers on how to provide preventive health services in a way that is sensitive to the unique needs of this population.  This research project is situated at the intersections of new media, gender studies, and health communication.  A non-probability study of sexual minority women in the U.S. was conducted in order to plan and implement a Web-based health communication campaign in Colorado that encourages preventive health practices among sexual minority women.  This paper assesses the ways in which new media can best be leveraged to improve the health outcomes of this population.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Overexpression of Amyloid Precursor Protein Induces Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress and Activated the Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathway</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic form of cognitive disability and is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Within chromosome 21 is the gene, amyloid precursor protein (APP). Proteolysis of APP into toxic and aggregate-prone, beta-amyloid fragments underlies the pathophysiology of Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Individuals with DS develop the neuropathology that can be diagnosed as AD; however, the role of APP overexpression in this comorbidity is presently unclear. Here, we elucidated the mechanism of cell death induced by overexpression of wild type APP. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a DsRed-APP fusion construct displayed caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation indicative of apoptosis. APP-induced apoptosis was blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor, (BOC), glutathione (GSH), or co-expression of Bcl-2. APP caused depletion of mitochondrial GSH, induced opening of the permeability transition pore, and triggered cytochrome c release. Each of these events was inhibited by GSH but was unaffected by BOC indicating that they were oxidative stress-dependent and upstream of caspases. We conclude that APP overexpression is sufficient to cause mitochondrial oxidative stress and intrinsic apoptosis. We are currently examining if a similar cell death pathway is induced by APP in neuronal cells. Our data are consistent with an increased expression of APP being a likely contributor to neuron death in DS. Thus, decreasing APP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis may be beneficial in reducing the comorbid phenotype of DS patients afflicted with AD.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Particle emissions from Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDVs) are currently measured by opacity or dynamometer gravimetric analysis. The Electronic Tailpipe Particle Sensor (ETaPS) is an inexpensive measurement device purported to give real time response to particle mass and was proposed as a possible addition to Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs. There were three goals to this study. The first was to verify ETaPS response to particle mass of HDDV exhaust. Integrated ETaPS signal was plotted against filter weight from dynamometer gravimetric analysis and a correlation was found. The second goal was to find a correlation between ETaPS readings and the Remote Sensing Detector (RSD). These tests were invalidated due tointerference from power lines greatly affecting the ETaPS signal. The final goal was to find a relationship between the RSD and the dynamometer gravimetric analysis. Comparisons were made from averaged RSD smoke data, and averaged gravimetric data for each HDDV undergoing both tests. A measurable difference was found for RSD smoke readings between Diesel Particle Filter (DPF) equipped vs. non-DPF and DPF bypassed HDDVs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The haredim in Israel are an ultra-Orthodox Jewish religious group who uphold the most conservative of Jewish laws. Instead of serving in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as all other Israelis do, the haredim are exempted from the IDF&apos;s policy of universal conscription. This thesis proposes three hypotheses to determine why Israel&apos;s haredim do not serve in the IDF. First, the haredim do not serve in the IDF because they do not want to; second, the haredim do not serve because they hold pacifistic political opinions; and third, the haredim do not serve because Jewish religious tradition forbids military service. To test these hypotheses, data were gathered by conducting a literature review and studying Israeli newspapers, official Israeli Government statistics, and unofficial public opinion surveys. Accordingly, a close examination of both the haredi worldview and the cultural characteristics of Israel&apos;s haredi communities suggests that the haredim do not want to serve in the IDF for self-interested reasons. Furthermore, a survey of haredi political opinions indicates that the majority of haredim exhibit a hawkish and aggressive political orientation. Finally, an analysis of individual haredi voices reveals that haredi yeshiva students consider their Torah studies to be an integral component to Israel&apos;s wartime activities. Contrary to the expectations of this thesis, haredi resistance to military service is not defined by an aversion to war or a commitment to peace, and it therefore cannot serve as a model for advocates of conflict resolution to emulate.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Perishable artifacts, such as basketry, cordage, and sandals are rare cultural materials due to the environments in which they are preserved and their inherent non-durability. Where recovered, researchers have used them to study expressed identity and trace population movements over time and space. On this premise, previously un-described sandal assemblages from Trinchera Cave, Colorado and the Kenton Caves, Oklahoma/New Mexico were age dated, analyzed, and compared to other known sandal collections throughout North America, including Franktown Cave, Colorado.  The study of the rare perishables from all three caves/rockshelters on the Southern High Plains have provided a unique opportunity for the acquisition of information regarding the technology used by and possible affiliations of prehistoric people in and immediately adjacent to this region. Specifically, the utilization of similar sandal styles at these sites at different times during the Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods suggests several population movements on the Southern High Plains.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Urban search and rescue (USAR) robots can benefit from small size as it facilitatesmovement in cramped quarters. Yet, small size limits actuator power, sensor payloads,computational capacity and battery life. We are alleviating these issues by developingthe hardware and software infrastructure for high performance, heterogeneous,dynamically-reconfigurable miniature USAR robots, as well as a host of otherrelevant applications. In this thesis, a generic modular embedded system architecturecalled RecoNode is proposed, which consists of a set of hardware and softwaremodules that can be configured to construct various types of robot systems fordynamic and unforeseen changes in the USAR environment. While at run-time thesystem can react to unexpected changes in configuration, such as nodes exhaustingtheir batteries or failure of sensors. These modules include a high performancemicroprocessor supporting complete on board processing for autonomous control, areconfigurable hardware component, and diverse sensor and actuator interfaces. Thedesign of all the modules in electrical subsystem, we move motion control and serialcommunication software to dedicated FPGA logic module, this way help system gainperformance by releasing CPU. The selection for module components, and thereal-time scheduler and operating system (OS) are described. The portable powersupply solution is also designed and tested out. Some preliminary experimentalverification and results are also presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study takes a critical look at consumption in liquid modernity as it plays out in secondhand shops.  Interviews with secondhand shop owners and shoppers demonstrate that secondhand fashion has the potential to promote individuality and foster relationships, ultimately encouraging a reflexive approach to consumption.  It also becomes clear that secondhand shoppers are more concerned with how they consume than what they consume.  Secondhand shoppers situate how they approach consuming as a facet of their identity that qualifies them as expert shoppers.  In addition, shoppers are aware that how they use secondhand fashion is an opportunity for individuality.  Shop owners encourage the reflexivity and individuality they see in their shoppers by the environment they create in their shop, ultimately assigning new meaning to the fashions in their shop. This study argues that secondhand fashion is a resistant practice of consumption in liquid modern times, but also teases out the ways in which secondhand shopping is embedded in liquid modernity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Despite participating in rehabilitation programs, many survivors of sex trafficking in India and Nepal are re-trafficked, `voluntarily&apos; re-enter the sex industry, or become traffickers or brothel managers themselves.  This thesis discusses the challenges of institutional rehabilitation from a critical theory perspective.  Drawing from three months of participant observation, interviews, and focus groups with rehabilitation professionals, this thesis will show that there has been a recent, positive shift in the discourse of survivor rehabilitation at the institutional level.  However, a focus on individual rather than holistic change, the structure of the rehabilitation process, and a lack of assessment tools has made these theoretical changes difficult to implement, resulting in a gap between &quot;rehabilitation in theory&quot; and &quot;rehabilitation in practice&quot; and the persistence of the status quo.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The conservation of prairie dogs is highly contested due to the embedded view that they are pests. This research addressed the ecological and social viability of prairie dog colonies in Denver, Colorado. Remote sensing analysis was applied to identify potentially viable areas for urban prairie dog colonies. In order to assess the social viability of urban colonies, knowledge and attitudinal surveys were distributed to residents near existing colonies and residents near potential colonies. Statistical analysis of responses provided insight into relationships between proximity to colonies, ecological knowledge, attitudes towards prairie dogs, demographics, and the presence of educational literature. Results indicated that women are consistently more favorable towards prairie dogs; knowledge was strongly associated with favorability towards prairie dogs; and residents living near colonies were more favorable towards local prairie dogs than residents living near potential colonies. While additional education and outreach is necessary in order to improve residents&apos; attitudes towards prairie dogs, this species has the potential to be viable in Denver.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis combines creative and academic efforts in an examination of the &quot;hybrid&quot; film. The question asked: in what ways can fiction be combined with non-fiction to engage with issues of social importance, is answered in analysis, and through practice.Traditional analysis is focused on films that blur the line between the documentary and the narrative-- the &quot;hybrid film&quot; or &quot;docufiction.&quot; Analysis through practice is presented in an original feature length script that moves back and forth between the documentary and fiction film. This feature length script-- entitled &quot;Rigged,&quot; develops a fictional story while examining the issue of corruption in the higher education finance and student loan systems. A final report returns to the thesis question and offers an assessment of the script&apos;s strengths and weaknesses.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>SEEING THE BUDDHA IN THE BOOK OF JOB THROUGH MAIMONIDES&apos;S THEORY OF PROVIDENCE AND ELIADE&apos;S THEORY OF HIEROPHANY</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The current study is an unusual reading of the book of Job with a focus on the intellectual transformation of Job.  The reading is stimulated by Maimonides&apos; theory of divine providence and facilitated by Eliade&apos;s theory of hierophany. The sequence of reading follows a reorganized order and is divided into three parts: the speeches of Job and his friends, the Lord&apos;s speech, and the comparison of Job before and after the Lord&apos;s speech.  The study ends with a suggestion that the experience of Job&apos;s intellectual transformation corresponds to the experience of the Buddha&apos;s enlightenment.  The reading ignores the enigmatic issues discussed in the book of Job and follows a new perspective of reading it as a whole.  The fruit of the study is the suggestion of seeing the Buddha in the book of Job through Maimonides&apos; theory of divine providence and Eliade&apos;s theory of hierophany.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Action representation for robust human activity recognition is still a challenging problem. This thesis proposed a new feature for human activity recognition named SIFT-Motion Estimation (SIFT-ME). SIFT-ME is derived from SIFT correspondences in a sequence of video frames and adds tracking information to describe human body motion. This feature is an extension of SIFT and is used to represent both translation and rotation in plane rotation for the key features. Compare with other features, SIFT-ME is new as it uses rotation of key features to describe action and it robust to the environment changes. Because SIFT-ME is derived from SIFT correspondences, it is invariant to noise, illumination, and small view angle change. It is also invariant to horizontal motion direction due to the embedded tracking information. For action recognition, we use Gaussian Mixture Model to learn motion patterns of several human actions (e.g., walking, running, turning, etc) described by SIFT-ME features. Then, we utilize the maximum log-likelihood criterion to classify actions. As a result, an average recognition rate of 96.6% was achieved using a dataset of 261 videos comprised of six actions performed by seven subjects. Multiple comparisons with existing implementations including optical flow, 2D SIFT and 3D SIFT were performed. The SIFT-ME approach outperforms the other approaches which demonstrate that SIFT-ME is a robust method for human activity recognition.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Terrorism Conflict:: How The United States Responds To Al Qaeda Violence And Expressed Grievances</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This study analyzes how the United States responds to Al Qaeda&apos;s messages and expressions of grievances and how America&apos;s responses escalate the conflict between the United States and Al Qaeda.After its first two attacks against America, Al Qaeda devised a strategy to draw America into a guerrilla war in Afghanistan, stating its intentions in its &quot;Declaration of War&quot; in 1996. Before this declaration, Al Qaeda worked from the shadows and denied reports it was either funding terrorism or participating in terrorism. Bin Laden continued his denials but took responsibility for some terrorist acts in his messages. President Clinton did not mention Osama bin Laden&apos;s name until the two US Embassy bombings in East Africa, which was the only terrorist act to which President Clinton responded militarily. Al Qaeda escalated its rhetoric and violent actions with each successive message and attack. After the September 11th attacks, Al Qaeda changed its rhetoric by offering peace overtures to the United States and its allies. Osama bin Laden continued his peace overtures throughout President Bush&apos;s two terms in office and into President Obama&apos;s first year. The peace overtures are discounted by both President Bush and President Obama, who say that Al Qaeda is not an organization that will negotiate peace. The rhetoric from Al Qaeda is that the long war will continue as long as the United States continues to occupy Arab and Muslim land, which is their primary grievance against America and its allies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper will first examine some of the causes over many years and conditions that evolved that preceded the 2007-2009 credit crisis as well as some of the events that took place in the midst of the crisis.  More importantly, this paper will examine how central banks applied the generally prescribed first line defense in the form of conventional monetary policy to its full extent without complete or adequate satisfaction or result.  The bulk of the paper is directed at a description and analysis of the unconventional monetary tools, that which has come to be called quantitative easing, that central banks may employ in instances where the demand for liquidity and the accompanying panic essentially overrun the liquidity levels normally associated with conventional monetary policy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>On first of October 2006 the Ministry of Justice in Iceland launch a restorative justice pilot project. Building on the pilot project data, this thesis evaluates the implementation of restorative justice into the criminal justice system in Iceland by asking victims, offenders and other participants in police- and expert-led conferencing to answer questionnaires&apos; relating to these two types of restorative justice practices to crime. The thesis compares its results with findings from a review conducted by Paul McCold (1998) who more than a decade ago challenged concerns on police facilitated conferencing. The data examined in the present thesis support Paul McCold&apos;s findings that police officers are capable of conducting conferences in a highly restorative manner when dealing with minor degree offences and that conferencing is an effective restorative justice practice that should be encouraged when conducted by police officers or trained professionals.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Resource Curse: The Cases of Botswana and Zambia</dc:title>

  <dc:description>A puzzling correlation has been observed over the last thirty years between slow or negative economic growth and countries with large export dependence on natural resources. This correlation has been dubbed &quot;the resource curse.&quot; It has been argued that resource wealth has an inherently negative effect on the economic growth of developing countries. Zambia is such a country in which resource-dependence has been coupled with poor economic performance; Botswana, however, is an important exception to this phenomenon. The question is: Why or how has Botswana surmounted the effects of the resource curse while Zambia has not? A comparative case analysis using Mill&apos;s method of agreement has been used in this study to assess this question. A variety of causal mechanisms have been proposed to explain this correlation. Among them are: (1) declining terms of trade, (2) commodity price volatility, (3) the enclaved nature of the mining industry, (4) Dutch disease, (5) the implementation of poor resource rents management policies, (6) the presence of weak state institutions, (7) the presence of rent-seeking and corruption, (8) the development of authoritarian regimes, and (9) the presence of social conflict. Of these nine hypotheses, those advancing commodity price volatility, the nature of rents-management policies, the strength or weakness of state institutions, the degree of rent-seeking and corruption, and the extent of social conflict as causal variables are found to be most important in accounting for the difference in outcomes between these two cases.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The understanding of leadership and how it is developed continues to evolve (Day &amp; Harrison, 2007) and while some essential components of effective leadership have been identified, they have not been forged into a comprehensive framework for development (Avolio, 2005). This paper aims to create a theory of leader and leadership development that can aid individuals in understanding who they are as a leader. Of central importance to this paper is the presentation of the Leader and Leadership Identity Development Model, which provides a framework centered on the development of individual leader and leadership identities at personal, interpersonal, and collective levels, rather than on the procurement of specific skills, traits, or behaviors which have been traditionally associated with leadership development.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Children&apos;s lives in the World War II Japanese American Internment Camp, Amache are investigated using a combination of archaeology, oral history, and archival research. As part of internees&apos; efforts to create a more hospitable environment both children and adults extensively modified the physical landscape. The importance of landscape and place in Japanese culture and for the internee community is examined using the development of gardens around the elementary school as a case study. Internees also developed a rich social landscape that allowed for the socialization of children within Amache. The socialization of children at Amache was being influenced by the internee community, the American government in the form of the WRA, and their own peer groups composed of other children usually with a dual cultural heritage. The influences of these socializing agents can be seen in the development of formal social organizations by adults, children&apos;s participation in them, and in the material culture used by children. Children also interacted with and conceptualized the political landscape which affected the formation of their identities.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Toward a Distributed Actuation and Cognition Means for a Miniature Soft Robot</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This thesis presents components of an on-going research project aimed towards developing a miniature soft robot for urban search and rescue (USAR). The three significant contributions of the thesis are verifying the water hammer actuation previous work, developing an estimator of water hammer impulse direction from hose shape, and creating the infrastructure for distributed cognitive networks. There are many technical issues in designing soft robots, in terms of perception, actuation, cognition, power, physical structure and so on. We are focusing on actuation and cognition issues in this thesis. We investigated water hammer actuation as an alternative system which provides a continuously distributed form of actuation results from water hammer effect. It is special because it is a soft actuation method. We generated some comparison experiments and verified the benefits of the water hammer actuation, and also designed our soft robot to be hose-like in order to utilize the water hammer actuator. For the cognition part, we first addressed and verified that the shape of the hose-like robot has impact on impulse direction from the water hammer actuation. And then we implemented an emulated synthetic neural network (ESNN) to analyze the direction of the impulse from the water hammer actuation. Then in order to achieve the long-term goal, we distributed the emulated synthetic neural network onto many embedded system boards to achieve a distributed cognitive network. The distributed nodes in the network are using Bluetooth communication.In the comparison experiments between the active tether system and passive tether system, we can clearly see the benefits of active tether in momentum transfer and friction reduction. For example, in the drag test, with the water hammer actuation the burden that the tether can pull was increased by about 1.6 times. For the distributed cognitive network, we successfully built an emulated synthetic neural network on distributed embedded system boards. With the shape information as the inputs, the difference on outputs from the ESNN and the experimental results is less than 3%.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Transforming Colombia&apos;s Conflict: A Case for Re-prioritizing U.S.-Colombia&apos;s Militaristic Approach</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The United State&apos;s influence on Colombia&apos;s militaristic approach to the conflict has deprived the nation&apos;s children of quality education and socio-economic opportunities, and created a culture of violence that has provided an expansive breeding ground from which armed groups and criminal networks continue to recruit.  Colombian citizens have developed and implemented various approaches that have proven effective in transforming Colombia&apos;s classrooms and largest cities into collaborative, socially responsible and accomplished communities. Yet these initiatives continue to fall short of their full potential, as the democratic security approach remains the focus of Colombia&apos;s policy and programming. In keeping with the theoretical orientation of &quot;conflict transformation&quot; as a strategy for addressing conflict, this study makes the case for prioritizing and adequately supporting transformative approaches, such as the two educational programs and city-wide community interventions presented in this document, that are alleviating the systemic issues fueling the conflict. Given that the youth population will inevitably evolve into future leaders or future insurgents and gang members, these young adults must be the focus of U.S.-Colombian policy, youth programming and funding priorities.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Trends in International Compulsory Licensing of Pharmaceuticals since the Institution of the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Protection (TRIPS) Agreement</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement went into effect for World Trade Organization (WTO) members in 1995. The agreement defines minimum standards of patent protection that must eventually be observed by all signatories. TRIPS includes &quot;compulsory licensing&quot;, a policy that allows for states under certain conditions to permit the use of a patented innovation without the consent of the patent holder. This paper considers instances of compulsory licenses (CLs) aimed to increase access to pharmaceuticals during urgent public health scenarios. The WTO maintains no registry of CLs; therefore, this research is an effort to catalog as many CL case studies as possible since the policy&apos;s institution and analyze them as a whole. Findings include 24 case studies involving 43 CLs in 18 nations. Results show that most CLs are issued by middle income nations such as Brazil and Thailand. Possible structural and institutional explanations are explored. The paper concludes that the policy is commonly practiced for purposes beyond its original design and that suboptimal outcomes are likely to result.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients are a well-practiced quantification of linear dependence seen across many fields. When calculating a sample-based correlation coefficient, the accuracy of the estimation is dependent on the quality and quantity of the sample. Like all statistical models, these correlation coefficients can suffer from overfitting, which results in the representation of random error instead of an underlying trend.In this paper, we discuss how Pearson&apos;s product-moment correlation coefficients can utilize information outside of the two items for which the correlation is being computed. By introducing a relationship with one or more additional items that meet specified criterion, our Transitive Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient can significantly reduce the error, up to over 50%, of sparse, sample-based estimations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Vignetwork (www.Vignetwork.com) is the name for an online system of interconnected short films that comes from the combination of the terms vignette and network.  By developing Vignetwork as an experiment in narrative structure, it is possible to analyze what a hypertext is and what it means as a tool, environment, and model for understanding the world.  By comparing it to various other films, projects, and ideas, Vignetwork emerges as a parable for how individuals define themselves in a shared, crowded world.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Utopian experiments creating new forms of community have dotted the globethroughout human history. Despite grandiose visions, a majority of communal experimentshave faded quickly into oblivion. A wealth of scholarship has focused on reasons whycommunes typically fail. My research of an ecumenical commune in northern NewMexico examines what has facilitated its perpetuation for over 42 years. I participated inthis community for different periods of time for over three years. With the assistance of aresident oral historian, I was able to expand my study into a diachronic view that spanneddecades. I conclude that there are multiple and interconnected factors that have givenstrength to this community. Factors contributing to its persistence throughout its existencehave been a strong economic base, strong social structures, overarching ideologies,adaptability, charismatic influence, ritual observances, sacralization of space and materialculture, amicable relations with the outside, conflict management mechanisms, andboundary maintenance. In the past two decades other factors have been added or intensifiedto contribute to its solidarity including a transient population and a widening circle ofoutside support.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Night, a time everyone experiences and few contemplate.  It is a time of darkness both figuratively and literally.  Darkness of the soul and of the mind, when some rest and others are restless.  We live in an age of endless day where the night is nothing more than a time to be blinded by electronic light.  With this in mind the question becomes how was our night seen in the past?  Also, how was the night and the darkness represented throughout time?  To answer these questions I researched the topic of night and made a film entitled 0300 - 0430.The film was only recorded between three and four-thirty in the morning and delved into what occurs at night and by whom.  Moving from mountain nightscapes to bustling cities the film explores what it means to be up at night.  Working, partying or at rest each has a part to play.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Critique of the Neoclassical and a Revision of the Keynesian Theories of Employment</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The neoclassical theory of employment fails to apply to modern capitalism since it claims that unemployment is necessary all voluntary. Its problems are pointed out by Keynes. But, if we look at Keynes&apos;s system, we find that an essential explanation about why modern capitalism suffers from weak demand is not provided. To answer this question an alternative consumption theory is needed. Levine&apos;s consumption theory well explains the condition of under-consumption. Furthermore, a deep problem of capitalism reveals itself: the production format and the distribution pattern of capitalism result in a huge income discrepancy between the working-class and the capitalist-class and its consequence, according to Levine&apos;s consumption theory, is an overall weak demand. The demand problem might be an inherent weakness of capitalism which cannot be cured within its structure. However, we still see the bright side of capitalism that is its influential stimulation mechanism, which provides more transformational growth - the driving force behind the progress of human civilization - than any other social structure. Unexpectedly, we become trapped in a dilemma.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>&quot;A shade too unreserved&quot;: Destabilizing Sexuality and Gender Constructs of the New Negro Identity in Harlem Renaissance Literature</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Much of the Harlem Renaissance artistic movement was directly intertwined with the New Negro social movement of the time.  Race leaders spoke to and influenced artistic trends, while artists often engaged with the New Negro race issues and social debates through their works.  Wallace Thurman, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston used their own fictional works to explore the New Negro construct being promoted.  In examining the constructed nature of this New Negro identity, these artists strove to destabilize the social &quot;norms&quot; upon which the identity was based.  As they thematically and stylistically explored such social constructs through their fiction, Thurman, Larsen, and Hurston simultaneously gave voice to those perspectives unrepresented within such restrictive constructs.  This project examines these authors&apos; subversion of such social constructs through the frameworks of intersectionality and contextual dialogue.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Abbot Suger&apos;s Silent Soliloquy of Public Aesthetics in the Medieval Saint Denis Abbey</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Abbot Suger transformed the twelfth-century medieval Saint Denis abbey from a didactic Romanesque prayer hall to a spiritually illuminating pre-Gothic worship center. The extant culture, although primarily illiterate, was poised on the threshold of Scholasticism, the rational pursuit of &quot;reason,&quot; which challenged the Christian doctrine of  &quot;faith.&quot; Abbot Suger, fully aware of the secular threat, was suitably positioned to be a significant instrument for saving souls from the diversion of their trust in God toward a reliance on logical thinking. Suger undertook a major art restoration campaign for the Saint Denis abbey to create an environment of public aesthetics that engendered a new, heightened experience of worship and devotion that illuminated God&apos;s Sovereignty. Suger synthesized centuries of philosophy and theology to manifest a silent soliloquy of what was ineffable at the time.Michel Foucault&apos;s method of intellectual archeological inquiry is used to gather relevant information, which contributed to Suger&apos;s vision and his artistic practice. Suger&apos;s art restoration in the Saint Denis abbey manifested the aesthetics of anagogical agency to lift the heads of worshipers toward a theophany of Divine Wisdom.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this study, data about occurrences in the affective domain of non-music-major subjects taking a keyboard-centered course that incorporates the nine National Standards for music education along with a methodology based on constructivist principles were collected.  The problem of this study was to identify any patterns in those data that might suggest hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships that might be tested later in quantitative studies with experimental design.The instruction consisted of a keyboard-centered music education curriculum that encompassed the U.S. nine National Standards for music education along with a teaching methodology based on constructivist principles.  This study was conducted in order to examine the relationship between five beginner piano subjects and the piano, revealed through observations (from their own perspective and the teacher&apos;s) on their feelings, thoughts, and emotions during the time of the research study.  Data for this research study were collected from a variety of sources:  pre- and post-instructional questionnaires, personal journal entries required from the participants, and researcher notes.This was a qualitative study in which questionnaires were administered and in which the subjects and the instructor kept journals that were collected and examined.  The lesson plans incorporated objectives representing the U.S. nine National Standards for music education, which are listed at the Web site of the National Association for Music Education (http://musiced.nafme.org/resources/national-standards-for-music-education/):1.  Singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.2.  Performing on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.3.  Improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments.4.  Composing and arranging music within specified guidelines.5.  Reading and notating music.6.  Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.7.  Evaluating music and music performances.8.  Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts.9.  Understanding music in relation to history and culture.The teaching methodology was based on constructivist principles that describe learning as a process in which learners construct their musical knowledge and upgrade their schemata based on their musical experience, while the role of the teacher is to facilitate and guide this process.  The implementation of the study and the actual data gathering took place at a medium-sized, private research university in the Rocky Mountain west of the United States during its 2012 spring quarter with subjects who were undergraduate non-music-major students.  This thesis is a report and analysis of the data collected.KeywordsU.S. Nine National Standards, music education, constructivism, non-music majors, keyboard-centered curriculum</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Alchemical Transformation and the Grief-Threshold in H.D.&apos;s Helen in Egypt</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In H.D&apos;s lyric epic, &lt;italic&gt;Helen in Egypt&lt;/italic&gt;, Helen of Troy experiences a phenomenological transformation in the brazier of the heart, which burns both on the beach of her new home in Egypt and in the depths of her psychic life.  I have envisioned a process by which Helen psychologically enters into the brazier&apos;s flames to begin an alchemical process, so that she might see the beauty of the earth emerge and understand the rhythmic significance of the heart&apos;s perception.  I call the brazier&apos;s (or the heart&apos;s) place of alchemical transformation the &lt;italic&gt;grief-threshold&lt;/italic&gt;, which balances Helen on the edge of the underworld, but also reveals that beauty is the aquifer of life&apos;s longing, both for her, and for mythical figures of her imaginal experience.  The visitations of figures like Achilles, Theseus, and Paris, bring Helen closer to understanding coniunctio, the alchemical marriage of masculine and feminine that takes place in the brazier of the heart.  Her identification with mysterious feminine figures like Aphrodite, Persephone, Thetis, and the Egyptian goddess Isis provides a mythic landscape through which to welcome &lt;italic&gt;anima mundi&lt;/italic&gt;--the soul of the world--inherent in the earth&apos;s beauty.  She finally learns that the alchemically transforming heart perceives with a greater trajectory, expanding the body and the psyche into intimate relationship with an Aphroditic consciousness that reveals the conversational wisdom of the earth and the heavens.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using CHO cells we sought to explore and characterize the functional relationship of rainbow trout MC5 receptor (rtMC5R) with zebrafish MRAP1 (zfMRAP1)  and rainbow trout MC2 receptor (rtMC2R), as well as how the effect of such relationships may play a significant role in Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal/Interrenal axis activation.  This research demonstrated that rtMC5R can be successfully expressed and functionally activated in CHO cells and, in a manner similar to mammals, α-MSH is the preferred ligand for rtMC5R.  The presence of MRAP1 does not seem to inhibit the expression or function of rtMC5R, rather it appears that it may increase expression and total activation levels.  In contrast, the presence of MRAP1 in conjunction with MC2R reduces expression and total activation levels of rtMC5R.  Findings indicate that rtMC5R may function in three different ways in a cell, depending upon the presence of other local proteins.   The interaction of rtMC5R with MRAP1 and MC2R, and the implications of such interactions will be described in this thesis.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The post-modern turn in the millennial generation has prompted a response toward religious and organizational authorities, whose organizations do not keep with the changing demand of post-modern individuals. The shift in preferences is marked by a movement from top-down hierarchical models, toward a de-centralized, bottom-up style demonstrated in recent movements. This paper examines the shift of doctrine and praxis within the American evangelical church and a simultaneous development of new methodologies in social justice organizations in these response movements.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>By applying common financial risk assessment models to the network economy formalized in Delli Gatti et al. (2006), and by contextualizing both in the broader literature on complexity in economic systems, the question of convergence in economic models is addressed. Critically, a formal state condition is identified which can contribute to the emergence of periods of extreme divergence from expected conditions even in a model characterized by restrictive assumptions regarding agent choice and market structure. The strength of the impact of this state condition, here the topology of a credit network, on the dynamics of the economic system is furthermore shown to be highly dependent upon the structure of the market. The existence of such state conditions has fundamental implications for the evaluation of risk and institutional design in economic systems</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Studies indicate that ATP is one of the primary neurotransmitters in taste transduction. ATP release occurs from taste cells via specific hemichannels such as pannexin/connexin hemichannels (Huang et al., 2007; Romanov et al., 2007). We hypothesize that Type II (receptor) and possibly Type III (presynaptic) cells release ATP at sites containing pannexin/connexin hemichannels. In this study, we examine the presence of connexin–32–LIR (Like Immunoreactivity) and connexin–43–LIR in rodent taste buds through immunocytochemical analysis and DAB (Di–amino–benzidine) immunoelectron microscopy. We observed that connexin–32–LIR co–localizes with P2X2–LIR in nerve fibers and in a small subset of NCAM–LIR cells. Connexin–32–LIR does not co–localize with α–gustducin–LIR or PLCβ2–LIR. We observed that connexin–43–LIR is present in a subset of PLCβ2–LIR cells and in a subset of α–gustducin–LIR cells. Connexin–43–LIR does not co–localize with NCAM–LIR cells or P2X2–LIR nerve fibers. These results are consistent with our results observed using DAB immunoelectron microscopy. Thus, our results indicate that both connexin–32 is expressed in Type III cells and nerve fibers and connexin–43 is expressed in Type II cells in rodent circumvallate taste buds.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Diabetes has become a cultural problem across America, but particularly in the Midwest and Southern regions.  For my film, I explored these two areas and compared the food and exercise culture to one of the healthier regions, the West.  Having moved from Indiana to Colorado, I used my own personal experiences to analyze why people in the Midwest struggle with diabetes and obesity at such a higher rate than those nearer to the Pacific Ocean.  Through a series of interviews with close friends and observational analysis of each state, I came to learn something very important about health: our food culture is embedded and encouraged by the people that surround us, and changing the way we behave is more than just being taught healthy activities.  People can change, but unfortunately I believe the problem is going to have to get worse before America takes it seriously enough to fix it.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Democratic Transitions in Divided States: The Case of Iraq</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Many theorists have posited that democratic transitions in states divided along ethnic, racial, or religious lines are accompanied by violent conflict and thus unlikely to succeed. The end of authoritarian rule in Iraq and the introduction of democracy by the United States has been followed by many such challenges, and it has been argued that the artificial Iraqi state and its Kurdish, Sunni, and Shia communities does not possess the unity as required by democratic government. However, an informed analysis of Iraqi democracy requires attention to the role of its authoritarian leaders and war and economic hardships in making Iraq&apos;s ethnosectarian communities largely competitive and conflictual. Furthermore, it is possible that continued participation in democratic institutions and processes, though imperfect, may build support for the system and legitimize it as the means to make political decisions. As a consequence, Iraqis may increasingly identify with the state and its democratic system rather than their more rigid, and at times conflicting, ethnosectarian identities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project aimed to obtain a set of fluorescent nucleoside analogues that closely resemble cytosine with extending the aromatic surface (extended conjugation) for enhance the photophysical properties.We have synthesized 2-amino [4,5-b]quinoline-one ring tCC  under super dry reaction conditions in &lt;10% yield.In addition, we have successfully reported new tC nucleoside derivatives with electrons donor substituent OCH3 group at carbon 7, tC7OMe, and the other at carbon 8, tC8OMe. These different substitution positions offer important distinctions between the design of the tC, tC8OMe, and tC7OMe. The unsubstituted tC nucleoside was easy to synthesize. In contrast, the synthetic strategy of the tC7OMe nucleoside that has electron donor substituent group OCH3 located at carbon 7 and para to amino group is synthetically less challenging and higher yielding than synthesis of tC8OMe which has OCH3 group substituent meta to amine group.Moreover, the fluorescence studies of modified tC nucleosides demonstrated distinguish fluorescence emission and absorption wavelengths for tC7OMe, and tC8OMe, which displayed higher quantum yields and brightness compared to unmodified tC, dependent on mismatch position of the electron donor group (7 or 8) on the tC.  This can be explained by the fact that the donor group OCH3 which allow for extended conjugation of unshared pairs of electrons lead to increases the freedom of the ᴨ-electrons and likely to raise the fluorescence.   Also, our fluorescence study established that there are effects of the different positions of substituent donor group. The fluorescence emission wavelength of tC8OMe, where the OCH3 is meta to amino group, is red sifted longer than the fluorescence emission wavelength of tC7OMe, where the OCH3 is para to amino group; however, tC7OMe exhibited higher quantum yield and brightness than tC8OMe.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Of the handful of neurotransmitters modulating taste response, norepinephrine (NE) may be the least understood. Although the physiological role of NE has been tested, it is still unclear whether the rat taste bud may serve as an endogenous source of neurotransmitter or if it must be taken up from outside the taste bud. Immunocytochemical analysis of DBH has shown that DBH–LIR is present in taste cells of the rat circumvallate papillae. Specifically, DBH–LIR is present in a subset of Type II taste cells. Nearly all (98%) DBH–LIR cells express PLCβ2–LIR, and about half (41%) of PLCβ2–LIR cells express DBH–LIR. DBH–LIR does not co–localize with NCAM, and thus, is not present in Type III cells.NET–LIR is present in the taste cells of the rat circumvallate papillae. Double labeling of NET–LIR and IP &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R3–LIR indicates that NET is present in Type II taste cells. A large proportion (77%) of NET–LIR cells express IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R3–LIR and all (100%) IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R3–LIR cells express NET–LIR. A small proportion (7.8%) of NET–LIR cells also express syntaxin–1–LIR in Type III cells. About a third (32.8%) of syntaxin–1–LIR cells express NET–LIR.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Pituitary lactotrophs are excitable cells that exhibit spontaneous, calcium influx triggering prolactin (PRL) secretion to stimulate lactation. Lactotrophs express estrogen receptors (ER) and are a well established estrogen-responsive cell system. 17B-estradiol (E2) is known to directly affect lactotrophs by increasing PRL transcription and biosynthesis, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and PRL secretion. This study demonstrates that the MMQ clonal cell line, isolated from the 7315a rat pituitary tumor, is a model lactotroph cell line that is E2-responsive. Spontaneous and evoked Ca2+ transients were especially sensitive to L-type channel block, but not affected by block of omega-conotoxin-GVIA-sensitive CaV channels or TTX-sensitive voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels. A population of 17B-Estradiol-treated cells exhibited enhanced spontaneous Ca2+ oscillation amplitude and frequency and depolarization-evoked Ca2+ transients.

  <dc:description>The documentary film Feasting On Four Wheels explores the new wave of &quot;gourmet&quot; food trucks on the streets of Denver, Colorado. What started as a bigger movement across the country made its way to the Mile High city in 2010 and snowballed to the food-loving community portrayed during the summer of 2011. Interviews with food truck owners, a food truck fabricator and a blogger for DenverStreetFood.com, explore the nature of the movement and how its existence creates a feel of community and culture within the city. The evolution of street food history and the influence of new technology are also discussed in relation to the current day movement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Engineered system diagnostics have been researched over the years with many successful results. From transportation systems to office technologies, many have been equipped with self-diagnostic capabilities and are called Smart Machines. In spite of these advances, current diagnostic systems are driven by direct sensory information without much concern for patterns of the system behavior or features associated with them. For large-scale systems with complex dynamics, global as well as local diagnostics become of great importance, where sensory information is used as input for the local diagnostics, and patterns of behavior or features are utilized for global diagnostics.The main objective of this research is to develop a bio-inspired data/information architecture for feature-based global diagnostics of a large-scale system. In order to accomplish this goal, information from local diagnostic systems is integrated with physical and engineering principles (e.g. conservation of momentum) to create a feature-based neuro-symbolic network. This network is very similar to a neural network, except that it is based on a physical equation, and it uses features instead of raw data. Results from this network identify patterns of behavior that display whether the system has any faulty states.  The architecture of this network includes two feature-based neuro-symbolic networks, one for the x-axis and one for the z-axis. Each of these networks has four inputs and four outputs, and includes one hidden layer.In order to verify performance of this feature-based diagnostic system, a working aircraft model has been equipped with pressure sensors on its wing surface, and data has been taken during flight. By using computational fluid dynamic analysis, pressure contours along the wing have been developed. These pressure patterns have been used as input for our developed feature-based neuro-symbolic networks to predict the state of the model aircraft in real-time. Based on these research results, we have developed a neuro-symbolic diagnostic technique which can be applied to fault detection of large-scale systems, using local diagnostic information.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Foreign Savings, Financialization and Minsky:  How External Capital Flows Pave the Way for Financial Instability in the Face of Increasing Risk</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Minsky&apos;s Financial Instability Hypothesis has not come without its fair share of criticism.  Much ado about Minsky&apos;s endogenous business cycle theory stems from a model where boom-time profit opportunities indelibly encourage firms to finance investment by leveraging their fixed capital assets against their internal liquidity.  Opposition to Minsky often points to two distinct circumstances that might discourage the external finance of investment: a rise in effective demand and increasing risk.  A rise in effective demand can increase the retained earnings of a firm providing more capital to internally finance investment and investment financed from retained earning is less risky than investment financed with debt.  This has fueled criticism of Minsky&apos;s framework as having controversial assumptions that discourage rather than encourage financial instability.This paper examines Minsky&apos;s Financial Instability Hypothesis from a savings and debt point of view in order to determine whether or not Minsky&apos;s financial crisis theory holds up to its critics.  It looks at the peculiar role of foreign savings in creating an incentive for financialization and how that engenders financial instability.  Moreover, I hope to display a theoretical argument that unifies much of the criticism of Minsky with the valuable contributions he has made to economic theory.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Health Insurance Exchanges: A Panacea or A Band-aid?</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In 2010, the 111th Congress passed the first national health care reform in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). This landmark legislation is intended to &quot;fix&quot; a health care system renowned for decreasing access and escalating costs.  This paper examines one of the principal reforms in the ACA, the state health insurance exchanges.  The author finds theoretical and empirical evidence to support the exchanges&apos; potential (in conjunction with other relevant ACA reforms) to increase access, decrease insurers&apos; excess profits and shift health care costs away from those least able to afford them.  The exchanges fall short of becoming a panacea, however, as they leave a large number of people uninsured, even in optimal scenarios.  Thus, the exchanges are essentially another band-aid for the system which covers additional people, yet does not cure the U.S. health care system&apos;s ills.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Though the Chicano nationalist movement of the 1960s and 1970s helped Chicanas/os embrace an indigenous identity traced back to the Aztecs of Mexico, it nevertheless proved alienating to Chicanas. In response to patriarchal structures of control within the Chicano movement and Western culture, Chicanas developed a mestiza consciousness. The grounding of this new epistemic tradition in ancient indigenous practices creates a Chicana spirituality and amethod for identifying with the cosmology and goddess mythology of the Aztecs. Though critics of Chicana spirituality question the authenticity of Chicana claims to indigenous traditions, Chicanas employ their spirituality as tool to transform them into agents of their own identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Ibn Khaldun and the Modern Social Sciences: A Comparative Theoretical Inquiry into Society, the State, and Revolution</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This thesis represents a link in a long chain of recent Western scholarship that has attempted to bring the work of Ibn Khaldun, the late 14th century Tunisian jurist and historian, into the mainstream of historiographic, political, and sociological learning. Why Ibn Khaldun? What makes his work stand out among the classics of pre-modern and early-modern political and social theory? Why are his ideas still relevant to the study of politics and societies today? My thesis attempts to answer these questions through the lenses of comparative political theory and theoretical reinterpretation.The study hinges on a thematic comparison of Ibn Khaldun&apos;s major ideas to those authors considered mainstays in the pantheon of Western social science: Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Hegel. Such comparison is necessary, I believe, to emphasize the vast contextual differences among the authors while simultaneously highlighting their many theoretical similarities. By doing so, I demonstrate both the surprisingly contemporary relevance and lasting theoretical value of Ibn Khaldun&apos;s conceptualization of political power, the state, and social change.Through careful comparison, this study attempts to simultaneously deepen and strengthen extant understandings of Ibn Khaldun&apos;s ideas while unearthing additional aspects either marginalized or neglected by the predominant scholarship. Moreover, it seeks to demonstrate Ibn Khaldun&apos;s lasting contribution and value to the modern social sciences--especially as it relates to the study of political rebellion and social change</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Though present-day American society generally assumes opera is one of the few remaining entertainment fields where talent matters more than physical appearance, as the 2004 firing of Deborah Voigt demonstrates, present-day opera singers are increasingly being held to stricter image standards.  In 2004, Covent Garden dismissed Voigt from their production of Ariadne auf Naxos, in which Voigt was supposed to reprise her critically acclaimed interpretation of the title role.  According to Voigt, Covent Garden&apos;s casting director Peter Katona felt that she was too large to fit into the black dress the new production required of the character.  Voigt&apos;s removal from the production and consequent media attention made opera&apos;s new image standards public.  My ethnographic and archival research concludes that present-day opera singers are expected to fit much more stringent physical standards.  Though popular publications like Classical Singer, Time, and Newsweek have published articles exploring the new standards, little published academic work has explored this topic.  As both a singer and an ethnomusicologist, I have spent several years observing and interviewing singers at various stages.  This thesis explores evidence supporting the focus on image within opera and examines how this emphasis impacts various facets of the opera community.</dc:description>

Symbiotic bacteria and fungi have wide-ranging effects on host plants, including improved nutrition, disease resistance, and drought tolerance.  Association with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) can enhance growth and protect plants from environmental stressors while they share products of photosynthesis with the resident fungi.  Scores of studies indicate that mycorrhizal plants are more resistant to drought stress than their non-mycorrhizal counterparts.  Use of microbes as a plant and soil supplement in home gardens represents a sustainable alternative to resource-intensive inputs and may allow for reduced water use.  I investigated the effects of commercially-available microbial products and a peat soil amendment on strawberry plants under water stress.  In a greenhouse experiment, strawberry plants were grown across factorial treatments of two AMF mixtures, two types of soil, and two water treatments.  Inoculated strawberry plants had greater total dry weight biomass and leaf surface area than un-inoculated plants but showed no increases in reproductive tissues.  Plants grown in peat-amended soil had improved growth in all measures except number of fruits and flowers.  This data shows that modification of urban and suburban soil with peat and soil microorganisms can improve plant biomass.Despite a large body of literature that describes the effects of mycorrhizal colonization on plant resistance to water deficit, reviews of these works are only in narrative form and it is therefore difficult to quantify the magnitude of the effect.  In a meta-analysis, we examined the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on growth and yield of plants exposed to water-deficit stress.  We found that, in terms of biomass measurements, mycorrhizal plants are more resistant to water stress compared to non-mycorrhizal plants.  When variables such as habit, lifecycle, or water stress level are considered, differences in mycorrhizal effect on growth between variables are observed.  For example, while growth of both annual and perennial plants is improved by symbiosis, perennials respond more favorably to colonization than annuals.  Overall, meta-analysis reveals a quantifiable corroboration of the commonly held view that mycorrhizal symbiosis improves plant&apos;s resistance to water-deficit conditions.Efforts to restore native vegetation may benefit from treatment of native seeds and plants with AMF.  Invasive plants can alter ecosystems by out-competing native species or changing the physicochemical properties of the local environment.  Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), a shrubby tree native to the Europe, Asia, and Africa, has now invaded 1.6 million acres of land in the western United States.  Tamarisk exudes salt from its leaves that accumulates in surrounding soils and can affect the growth of native plant species.  Here we examined the effect of AMF on the growth of an array of restoration species native to riparian areas of the southwest US under varied water and salinity regimes.  AMF affected only one plant species with regard to root biomass and root:shoot ratio.  Infection rates of inoculated plants varied from 0-61% and were limited by high salinity.  We also found that salinity and water have strong effects on several native species, and that biomass decreases with increasing salinity or decreasing water.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Kicking the Can is a video documentary that explores the financial crisis of 2008 and the socio-political factors that led to the collapse. The documentary was produced over the course of a year and a half, and contains interviews with economists, politicians, academics, and U.S. citizens. Kicking the Can ultimately reveals that the financial crisis is a complex issue that can be analyzed and interpreted from a variety of political and social perspectives. This paper documents the making of the film, the production involved, and the process of working with collaborators and other crewmates.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study evaluates the local food movement within the Highlands neighborhood of Denver, Colorado. There are several potential outlets for local food within the Highlands and it is a diverse demographic community, which creates an interesting andrelevant research area. This study evaluates the reasons behind the local food movement through qualitative research of community members, local restaurant owners, community garden members and community organizers as well as through participant observation. The goal of this research is to narrate what one neighborhood within a progressive city is experiencing within the local food movement. The local food movement was found to bepresent through many outlets such as a farmer&apos;s market, locally committed restaurants, several community gardens, locally committed households, several local food stores, local food-oriented community groups and a general desire by the residents to participate in a community-based effort working towards sustainable food systems. The motivations behind participating in the local food movement were found to primarily be building and fostering community, an increasing population that has the means to support local food and finally, a network of people and organizations that reach farther than just one neighborhood. This study has the ability to supply urban planners, city officials and community organizers in many U.S. cities with information about land use, sustainablefood systems, the role of community and the purpose and benefits of local food concept.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>One growing field in alternative energy is biofuel production through microorganisms. This field of research includes hydrogen and biofuel production through the cultivation of algae.  In this work, we have selected two different algae to study, Anabaena sp. cpcc 387 and Tetraselmis. Through mathematical modeling of Anabaena we investigated the complex multicellular relationships and colony stability when noise is introduced. We developed a mathematical model using a system of differential equations that simulates the population growth through optical density over time of Anabaena. When the model was compared to experimental data obtained through growing Anabaena in a photobioreactor, we found a strong linear correlation of 0.98 suggesting that the model reasonably simulates the lag, exponential and stationary phase. As a result, the model may be used to study the effects of varying different parameters in Anabaena&apos;s environment in order to predict what effect it will have on colony growth pattern and population.In conjunction with researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we characterize Tetraselmis cells&apos; membrane elasticity. Through use of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), varying forces were applied to the cell membrane that was used to find the modulus of elasticity to be 79.8 KPa ± 19.8 and 46.9 KPa ± 2.04 for two differentcells tested. Having found the modulus of two cells is the starting point for collecting more data on this strain and other strains along with various other pretreatments. This will allow for cross comparisons between cell membrane strength and give quantitative evidence for which strain and pretreatment yield the weakest cell membrane to allow to lipid extraction.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The context of this work is the development of open source software to support researchers to quickly build systems of molecules for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The goal is achieved through the integration of three open source programs by judicious modifications and creation of new source code, which allows the creation of molecular models, MD cells and the LAMMPS geometry input files. The software changeswork together supporting an easy and intuitive process for simulation system creation. Creation of multiple MD cells for research simulations becomes quicker and provides needed standardization to the simulation process. The researcher can select from atomistic force fields or modify the software to use other force fields. The software has been validated by generating the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the bulk modulusfor a cross-linked epoxy system composed of Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol-A and Isophorone diamine (DGEBA/IPD). The Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) software is used to conduct the molecule dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease that affects motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Many studies indicate that mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS) is a principal mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of this and other devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated a unique whey protein supplement (Immunocal®) to determine its neuroprotective efficacy in several in vitro models of MOS and in an in vivo mouse model of ALS. This non-denatured whey supplement contains cystine which is an oxidized form of cysteine, an essential precursor for synthesis of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). In primary cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), pre- incubation with Immunocal® completely protected against MOS induced by HA14-1, an inhibitor of the pro-survival Bcl-2 protein. This effect was prevented by co-incubation with the gamma-glutamyl cysteine ligase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, demonstrating that the de novo synthesis of GSH underlies the neuroprotective mechanism of Immunocal®. Additionally, Immunocal® displayed significant protection against an array of MOS-inducing agents, including sodium nitroprusside, copper, and aluminum, supporting its ability to upregulate mitochondrial antioxidant capacity. In accordance with these findings in CGNs, Immunocal® decreased cell death due to both H2O2 and glutamate toxicity in NSC34 motor neuron-like cells. Immunocal® also significantly protected CHO cells from MOS evoked by overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Immunocal® treatment in NSC34 motor neuron-like cells decreased cell death caused by both H2O2 and glutamate glycine. Most compelling are our findings in the hSOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. These mice were given Immunocal® (3.33% solution in drinking water) ad libitum, beginning at 60-days-old. Although no effect on overall survival was observed, Immunocal®-treated mice displayed a significant (7 ±1.08 day) delay in disease onset, compared to mutant control mice. Importantly, Immunocal®-treated mice showed a highly significant decrease in the rate of decline in grip strength. Finally, using HPLC-ECD we found that whole blood and lumbar spinal cord GSH levels were each depleted by nearly 50% in end-stage hSOD1G93A mice, and these reductions were essentially prevented in mutant mice receiving Immunocal®. These findings suggest that sustaining GSH by supplementation with Immunocal® may help to mitigate the progression of ALS through suppression of MOS.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper analyzes U.S. public diplomacy in the Middle East. In explaining the concept of public diplomacy itself and its evolution in the United States, four factors are identified as most crucial to the capabilities and limitations of U.S. public diplomacy in the region: U.S. foreign policy options, institutions, strategies, and tools. These factors are shown to affect the outcome of U.S. public diplomacy programming in the Middle East and are the foundation for a new U.S. public diplomacy model.The paper continues by examining the development of contemporary U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, providing a traceable landscape upon which U.S. public diplomacy sits and responds to increasingly negative public opinion of the United States. Generally, U.S. foreign policy has shifted toward more aggressive containment policies while promoting support of democratization despite partnership with repressive regimes. While the United States is able to pursue a containment strategy, such contradictory elements exacerbate the structural and institutional limitations of its public diplomacy outcomes in the region.Finally, this paper considers whether or not U.S. public diplomacy has been an underdeveloped foreign policy tool. The conclusion is that the capabilities of the current U.S. public diplomacy experiment are substantially limited due to a lack of institutional participation in the outset of policy formulation. As such, brief recommendations are put forth to correct these contradictory elements of U.S. foreign policy.</dc:description>

These proteins, however, must be maintained in their correct, biologically active conformation throughout processing, transportation, and delivery. This requirement poses serious engineering challenges because of a protein&apos;s susceptibility to thermodynamic instabilities resulting from the weak bonds driving the tertiary structure of the molecule.  A particularly problematic type of protein degradation is aggregation. Administration of aggregated proteins, a particularly problematic degradation form, can have dire consequences, including blocking a patient&apos;s responsiveness to therapy, inducing immunogenicity, and even anaphylactic shock and death. Normal shipping and delivery methodologies are suspected of causing protein aggregation after the normal quality control process has been completed. This work investigates the effect of acoustic cavitation on protein aggregation as a function of impurity level, gas-liquid surface to value ratios, protein concentration, solution viscosity, density, surface tension, and nebulization time. A 0.2M and pH of 4.2 Glycine buffer solution was utilized with IVIg protein at 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/ml and 20ºC. Protein aggregates were characterized using Microflow imaging and NanoSight tracking analysis. Transient cavitation and formation of radicals was monitored using classical iodine assays.  Higher protein aggregation is observed in solutions that initially contain greater amounts of impurities or have a larger contact area with the gas interface. Aggregate production in hyper clean solutions, with no gas-liquid interface, initially increases with protein concentration, but eventually decreases at high concentrations.In contrast, aggregation rates in hyper clean solution with a gas-liquid interface continue to fall with increasing protein concentration.  The size of the particulate in these two conditions suggests different degradation pathways. The small sizes when a gas interface is available are likely a result of the large area over which the process takes place. The effect of concentration is actually an effect of diffusion or availability for proteins at the surface. The large sizes found in conditions with no gas interface suggest a much more concentrated process consistent with an intense energy release at a single location. Moreover, monitoring of the formation of I3- from iodine as a function of nebulization time shows increasing production or radicals. All this supports the hypothesis that ultrasonic pressure waves in protein solutions cause transient cavitation which upon bubble implosion release hydroxyl radicals that can attack the protein in solution.  In this circumstance, a rise in viscosity at higher protein concentration inhibits cavitation by elevating the lowest pressure region based on a specified pressure drop.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since the last quarter of the twentieth century, Fourth World populations, including those in Honduras, have been steadily gaining partial recognition of cultural rights; yet often official discourses of national identity continue to subsume cultural traditions of indigenous and Afro-descendant communities.  Honduras&apos;s heterogeneous ethnic pluralism has historically been combined to promote a more cohesive national identity of a homogenized, mayanized, indo-Hispanic mestizaje. Exclusion and mis- or under-representation of indigenous groups is reinforced by popular imagination, particularly in the cultural heritage and tourism sectors.  Firmly situated within regional Latin American and global trends, over the past two decades, official discourse on Honduran national identity has ostensibly shifted from hegemonic notions of mestizaje to one of ethnic diversity and multiculturalism.This thesis is a multi-sited ethnography that examines the cultural politics of four institutions of power in Honduras. I explore how one state-sponsored project and three private museums contributed to the redefinition of ethnicity in Honduran national identity.  I suggest that although these institutions seemingly project the new official discourse of multiculturalism, in fact they uphold antiquated notions of national identity and continue to depict reductionist, universalized, and exclusionary visions of ethnicity in Honduran national identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Non-recycling and non-composting of municipal solid waste have important natural resource management implications, in that they both reduce energy, water, and raw natural resource use.  Responsible waste management also likely has positive climate impacts by virtue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Recycling and composting are pro-environmental behaviors that have been shown to be influenced by numerous socio-demographic and psychological factors.  This study analyzes the correlation of a number of variables with frequency of recycling and composting in select census tracts in Denver, CO, USA, with the goals of informing waste management policy and contributing to the overall pro-environmental behavior literature.  The results show that habit strength as quantified by the Self-Reported Habit Index has the strongest correlation with both recycling and composting behavior.  Overall, waste management policy should focus on influencing habit formation, using literature to dissuade residents from placing plastic bags into recycling bins, and consider charging a minimal fee for recycling.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A balance-of-power argument that completely discounts the role played by the United States has been employed in a recent attempt to explain both the origins of European integration and the Continent&apos;s recent difficulties. This thesis sets out to rebut these notions through an examination of the historical record. Such an examination makes it clear that France and West Germany&apos;s reasons for pursuing the integration of Western Europe were grounded in these states&apos; relationships with one another within the postwar context, not in their fear of Soviet aggression. France, after all, was seeking to rebuild itself and hold down the Germans after the war, while West Germany was seeking to regain its sovereignty. Further, it is clear from the historical record that the role played by the United States in the earliest iterations of postwar European integration was critical and should not be discounted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper analyzes contemporary Russian Foreign Policy toward the Middle East.  Six factors are identified as most critical to Russian foreign policy in the region: Islamic terrorism, arms transfers, natural resources, influence over former Soviet Spaces, general trade, and great power status.  With rare exceptions, these principles are shown to guide Russian foreign policy in the Middle East since 2000.The paper continues by considering the effectiveness of Russia in achieving its desired policy outcomes in the Middle East.  This includes assessing situations in which two or more priorities run counter to each other.  Generally, Russia is shown to be effective at achieving its more pragmatic goals, and ineffective at achieving its abstract ones.Finally, the paper considers whether or not Russian foreign policy has remained consistent through the Arab Spring.  The conclusion is that Russia is presently unable to move beyond policies that represent clear mutual benefits with Middle Eastern states.  As such, Russia is not a threat to undermine fundamental United States policy objectives in the region.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis examines the phenomenon of civil war and state failure in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from a social contract perspective. Its main hypothesis is that authoritarianism will lead to state failure in the context of SSA.  In this regard, SSA states are political communities that have not done enough to promote and develop a social contract that is compatible with the region&apos;s sociopolitical and structural peculiarities. Since civil war and state failure have hampered different dimensions of human progress in SSA, analyzing the main patterns of conflict will inevitably lead to an underlying incompatibility between existing governing political structures and the region&apos;s social structures. In this case, one major characteristic pattern of civil war and state failure in SSA is that they are caused by delegitimization of government authority by ethnic groups whose allegiance to internal traditional authority is still stronger than to centralized government. Hence, a social contract that will allow ethnic groups to legitimize state authority is what SSA lacks and needs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>An increase in the number of multinational enterprises (MNEs) has increased the attention on cross-border challenges, such as transfer price manipulation (TPM). TPM is a development issue - it undermines institutions as well as siphons money from government revenues that could be directed towards programs for human development. Pervasive corruption in the natural resource sector supports an environment where TPM can flourish. This paper develops a strategy for combating TPM within the countries of the Southern African Customs Union. It does this by 1) defining the terrain of illicit flows, both generally and specifically to the abuse of transfer pricing through TPM, as well as the nature of corruption in the natural resources sector; 2) exploring the role of private actors by examining global trends in transfer pricing, as well generalizing trends by public actors from recent actions taken by governments of developing countries; 3) exploring the extent of MNE involvement in the natural resources sector within the SACU region, as well as the specific legislation surrounding the sector; and lastly, 4) developing a strategy based on international norms and standards. A fully accurate assessment of TPM is unavailable because of a limited amount of data. Through proxy analysis, this paper finds that the transfer pricing and mineral legislation of the SACU region fails to regulate TPM adequately. Developing a coordinated strategy based off international standards, with the SACU institution and its members as the primary drivers, is the best step towards limiting the abuse.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study investigates the potential influence of shared musical identities of young adult children and their parents in relation to communicative and relational aspects of family, in order to determine whether musical tastes of individuals impact family relationships. In this research study, 196 college students reported on their perceptions of shared musical identity with their parents, shared family identity, parental accommodative communication behaviors, and family satisfaction. Results indicated that shared musical identity positively predicted perceptions of shared family identity, parental accommodative behaviors, including general accommodation, overaccommodation, topic management, and family satisfaction. Furthermore, shared musical identity and shared family identity positively predicted perceptions of parental accommodative behaviors and family satisfaction. Finally, perceptions of parental accommodative communication behaviors mediated the relationship between shared musical identity and family satisfaction. These findings indicate that music may have a noteworthy influence on family relationships, including impacting perceptions of communication and satisfaction between parents and their children, as well as perceptions of family identity. These findings also suggest that social identity theory, communication accommodation theory, and shared family identity can be applied to, and illuminate aspects of, nuclear family communication and relationships, which are areas not often explored with these theories.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>THE THEORETICAL SYMBOLISM OF ERUVIN: A Model of Dual-Identity and Sacred Space</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Eruvin are an innovative solution to the logistical &quot;problem&quot; of carrying on the weekly Sabbath. Boundaries that symbolically extend the walls of private homes into the public sphere, eruvin allow Orthodox Jews to carry objects outside of their homes on the Sabbath, a seemingly simple act that would otherwise be prohibited. Constructed according to intricate Rabbinic specifications, eruvin use existing architectural elements such as walls, train tracks, roadways and telephone wires, as well as natural features like rivers to create a continuous boundary. This paper will examine the theoretical significance of creating such a space. My argument maintains that beyond the functional application for observant Jews, eruvin strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities while subsequently allowing for the full integration of the same Jewish community into the majority &quot;mainstream&quot; culture. Further, they represent a challenge to western notions of space, most emphatically the concept that physical space can hold more than a singular meaning; the result is that the eruv becomes a model for &quot;territoriality without sovereignty ,&quot; or a microcosm of symbolic Jewish geography while simultaneously being a part of the American cultural landscape.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This case study describes the analysis of the Visitor Photo Study, a study in which visitors to the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science documented their visit through pictures. The origins, implementation, and findings of the Visitor Photo Study are considered within the contexts of the fields of Community-Based Research (Strand, Marullo, Cutforth, Stoecker, &amp; Donohue, 2003b), Visual Studies (Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2011; Pink, 2007), and Visitor Studies (Visitor Studies Association, 2012). This study considers the extent to which the principles and elements of each of these fields were present in the Visitor Photo Study, which elements were not fully realized or were missing from the study, and ways in which the Visitor Photo Study extends each of these fields. The value of this type of analysis and implications for museums, faculty, and students are also discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Altered Calcium handling in cerebellar Purkinje neurons with the malignant hyperthermia mutation, RyR1-Y522S/+</dc:title>

  <dc:description>To investigate the etiology of malignant hyperthermia and central core disease, mouse models have recently been generated and characterized (Chelu et al., 2006). These RyRY522S/+ knock-in mutant mice provide an excellent tool to investigate calcium dysregulation, its pathological consequences, and potential therapeutic approaches. Skeletal muscle harboring this mutation exhibits calcium leak from internal stores and an increased sensitivity to activation by caffeine, voltage, and temperature (Durham et al., 2008). Although alterations in RyR1 channel function and resultant changes in cellular function have been characterized in skeletal muscle, the effects of MH mutations in RyR1 on central nervous system function have not been investigated. Since RyR1 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, our goal is to investigate whether the RyRY522S/+ mutation causes altered calcium handling and whether potential calcium dysregulation alters cellular function.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Since the 1970&apos;s, recessions have become more frequent and severe, causing major changes to the labor market and the importance of education. This study focuses on the problems for employees with master&apos;s degrees and MBAs, and asks three questions: 1) Do employees with graduate degrees have higher earnings than bachelor&apos;s degree recipients, 2) Do they experience greater job security as a result of their additional education, and 3) Is graduate school a way to avoid unemployment during a recession? Ordinal logistic regression analysis is conducted and finds that master&apos;s degrees and MBAs experience very different outcomes, with much higher returns for MBAs, although master&apos;s degrees do see higher earnings than bachelor&apos;s degrees. Job security is slightly higher for the graduate degrees relative to bachelor&apos;s degrees, which could account for the relatively higher earnings.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Human trafficking is an international problem that penetrates every society on the globe. Trafficking in children for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, and domestic servitude occurs in every state of the United States. Education is key in preventing human trafficking and American students lack proper knowledge of the issue. This study seeks to bridge this shortcoming through the creation and implementation of a holistic anti-trafficking advocacy curriculum that not only informs and motivates students and educators toward advocacy, but also meets Colorado state academic standards. Case studies using sixth grade students in Denver show the impact that such a curriculum has, not only on knowledge gained, but student empowerment and civic responsibility through advocacy.The author analyzes the impact of the Aware Curriculum through formative and summative assessments, classroom observation, and diagnostic written assessments to gauge knowledge, comprehension of key concepts, and student thought processes about anti-trafficking advocacy.â€&lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Blue Lines, Greenbelts, and the Effects of Growth Management: The Geographical Effects of Growth Management Policies in Boulder, Colorado</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This study evaluates and describes the effects of growth management policies, established by the city of Boulder, Colorado, for the city and the surrounding region. A variety of techniques contribute to this evaluation, including remote sensing analysis of land-use change for the region, mapping of commuter flow patterns, and analysis of the distribution of housing values, housing units, number of jobs, and income values. Growth management policies focus on planning for development to ensure continuous, adjacent growth, while preventing haphazard, leapfrog development.  In cases such as Boulder, when planning is implemented unilaterally by a city as opposed to on a regional level, growth tends to be funneled to new locations, thereby perpetuating sprawl and all its negative implications. Boulder has had a long history of employing a variety of policies to manage growth, including a service area boundary as well as a tax to preserve open space that results in a greenbelt that defines the extent of the city. The result has been the formation of a sharp edge between the urban and rural landscape, with increased commuters from the surrounding area, a mismatch between jobs and housing, and a worker earning/housing cost mismatch for Boulder.  This has funneled growth to the surrounding area, as documented by steady increases in the built environment.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiestereses (PDEs) promoted an increase in intracellular [cAMP]c and an influx of Ca2+, in both MMQ pituitary cells and α-Pancreatic cells. The specific targets for PDEs and the domains of PDEs are still unknown. Pituitary MMQ cells were used as a model to test modulation of calcium influx through the L-type calcium channel with PDE inhibitors. cAMP analogs were used to determine cAMP molecular targets. 8-cpt-cAMP initiated an Epac mediated pathway and had strong effects on calcium influx in the cell; suggesting, a relatively strong cAMP target. Experiments of α-Pancreatic cells were done in 2mM glucose and 8mM glucose to stimulate hypoglycemia and resting states respectively. Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) was observed when αMSH was applied with the three PDE inhibitors. When αMSH was applied without a PDE inhibitor there was no increase in [cAMP]c, suggesting a micro domain.  Extracellular solutions of 2mM glucose with PDE inhibitors such as Milironone, there was influx through N-type and L-type channels and then steady CICR. Rolipram decreased the amount of [Ca2+]c influx compared to the control, suggesting an inhibitory effect. PDE locations within the cell dictate the level of [cAMP]c increase and the influx of [Ca2+]c.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Faced with the global financial crisis, which has a large impact on the world&apos;s economy, China and the United Stated took different actions to pull the economy out of it, based on the fairly different financial, fiscal, and even political systems they have. This thesis focuses on the comparison of the financial and fiscal systems and trade structures between the two different countries, and how these have impact on their stimulus packages, thus influencing the economic recovery as a whole.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Climate Change and Intrastate Conflict in Africa</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Africa has the dubious distinction of being the continent most likely to experience the worst climate change has to offer while having the population most vulnerable to its effects. Many of the continent&apos;s sub regions and countries also have recent histories of violence or are currently mired in conflict. Africa&apos;s proneness to conflict and its vulnerability to climate change provide the best model for showing how climate change, by the way it interacts with other, better understood drivers of conflict, will likely become an important source of conflict within the region and around the world over the rest of this century.This paper&apos;s aim was to identify some possible causal pathways by which the effects of climate change might be linked to the outbreak of conflict. To achieve this, this paper sought to answer five main questions: 1) why do conflicts occur when and where they do? 2) How might climate change impact human societies in Africa? 3) Can those impacts lead directly to conflict occurrence, or 4) might they instead act indirectly, through other, more central drivers of conflict? 5) Should there be a climate-conflict relationship, can we build a model to identify potential future conflict `hotspots&apos; in Africa or around the world? By providing some answers to these questions, we were able to identify several possible climate-conflict pathways. We found that the economic impacts of climate change, particularly on a country&apos;s agricultural sector and economy through direct disaster related damage do provide a realistic pathway to conflict in vulnerable countries as peoples&apos; livelihoods are negatively impacted, the impacts are not equally shared among all ethnic groups, and the state itself may not be able to correct such imbalances.The economic impact of climate change coupled with its negative impact on food and water security may also drive increased levels of migration, and with the movement of large numbers of people comes a greater probability of conflict. The impacts of climate change may also weaken states to the point that they can no longer provide basic services demanding by its population, leading to a loss of legitimacy and potentially the rise of rebellion. The pace of climate change can also affect the likelihood of conflict occurrence with more rapid pace developments and disasters being more likely to cause conflict due to less possibility of successful adaptation. In each pathway, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, acting through other sociopolitical, economic, democratic, security and systemic drivers to increase the likelihood of conflict, rather than driving conflict outright.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Colorado&apos;s Large Snow Events&apos; Impact on Tree Ring Growth and Dillon Reservoir</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Meteorological observations from 1894 through 2010 suggest that 17 historically large snow events occurred in the mountains of Colorado within Denver&apos;s water supply region.  Of these 16 events, 14 can be identified in precipitation sensitive tree ring records as positive climatic pointer years.  If these storms were to occur today, they would have the potential to fill reservoirs in Denver Water&apos;s supply system, even after years of sustained drought.  These &quot;drought busters&quot; have the potential to refill Dillon Reservoir by increasing average yearly inflow up to 146% of the previous year&apos;s inflow.  Such drought busters can help Denver recover from droughts that will most likely increase in frequency and severity in the near future.  However, drought busters cannot be precisely predicted because past positive climatic pointer years used for calibration may be falsely identified due to certain climatic patterns and the biological responses of trees.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Afterlife and the concept of soul in Judaism is one of the main subjects that are discussed in the academia. There are some misassumptions related to hereafter and the fate of the soul after departing the body in Judaism. Since the Hebrew Bible does not talk about the death and afterlife clearly, some average people and some scholars claim that there is nothing relevant to the hereafter. However, in this study I put the Hebrew Bible to conversation with ancient cult of the dead and Medieval Jewish philosophers Saadya Gaon and Yehuda Halevi to proof the existence of afterlife and immortality of the soul in Judaism; even though Judaism is defined as the religion of this world and present time by some Jews and described by some scholars as the religion that does not have an afterlife concept in it.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>DEVELOPMENT OF WEARABLE SENSORS FOR BODY JOINT ANGLE MEASUREMENT</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This thesis presents the development of three different methods for body joint angle measurement using wearable sensors. Continuous monitoring of patients&apos; movements and activities has recently become one of the active research areas in the field of body sensor network and telehealth monitoring. For many medical and rehabilitation applications, a continuous monitor of the patients&apos; daily activities at home without visiting the hospital is desirable. This type of monitoring is beneficial for the therapists and physicians as it does not require patients&apos; physical presence. Traditionally, measuring the range of motion (ROM) is performed in hospitals by utilizing standard tools such as a goniometer. This method needs to be fulfilled by a physiotherapist in the hospital and requires great deal of overhead. Thus, a remote sensing technique for monitoring the progress of body joint flexion during regular daily life activities becomes very beneficial.The main focus of this thesis is on developing different methods for sensing body joint angle, although we developed some mechanisms for transmitting measurements from patient&apos;s side to a remote server at the hospital. The first method for measuring the joint angle- specifically the knee joint- is based on an encoder attached to a brace. The second method is performed by utilizing a wearable cloth with flex-sensors. In the third method, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are employed to measure the desired joint angle. We conducted several experiments to compare the feasibility and accuracy of each method for angle measurement with ground truth measurements. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed and explained in detail in the assigned section.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Digital storytelling is a multimedia genre that has been steadily gaining recognition since its inception in the early 1990s.  Study abroad is also on the rise among U.S. undergraduates.  Study abroad returnees often lack opportunities for structured reflection upon their experiences abroad.  Digital storytelling is one reflective tool that may be useful for stimulating reflection as part of a narrative process, which connects past events with current life choices and solidifies identity.  Five undergraduates and three graduate students attended digital storytelling workshops, created digital stories, and were interviewed.  Analysis of these case studies found that while graduate students were more adept at identifying life-changing moments, both groups benefited from narrative closure.  The study confirms that digital storytelling is an important resource for study abroad returnees to help them uncover the significance of their experience abroad and can be used as an institutional assessment tool.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Great Recession has been drawing the attention of many due mainly to its global impact that has been considered very similar to the Great Depression.  So have been the root causes.  Among the competing explanations, the present study focuses on two of them that were the same factors - among others - to explain the root causes of the Great Depression: the dramatic shift in income distribution and the sudden drop in autonomous (or wealth-based) consumption.  Accordingly the present study examines first, the role of income distribution shifts to demonstrate the fact that such a shift placed a significantly larger share of U.S. national income in the hands of the top one percent of income recipients at the same time as median real incomes were declining that in turn led to increased reliance on Mortgage Equity Withdrawal (MEW) and increases in debt ratios for middle income households.   Second, it focuses on the role of wealth-based consumption by drawing attention to the similarities of the Great Depression and the Great Recession in regard to these two topics.  The study concludes that although there are competing explanations for the Great Recession, the two factors are significant due to the fact that they have the potential to turn an ordinary recession into a depression or prolong it for a very long time.Key words: Income distribution, autonomous (or wealth-based) consumption, Mortgage Equity Withdrawal (MEW), Great Depression, Great Recession.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis project will examine cultural and rhetorical communication studies to determine how these modes of analysis can be compared with interdisciplinary literature to better understand the role fashion plays within everyday performances and the shaping of identity.  Criticisms by second-wave feminist scholars have focused on the fashion industry&apos;s overarching male influence; in more recent scholarship, feminist academics have often considered an affinity for fashion to be un-feminist and oppressive. I argue that fashion can instead be viewed as a tool for female agency and expressing individuality, rather than just a mode for reinforcing gendered norms. Using feminist rhetorical analysis and visual content analysis, this project examines imagery found on three popular fashion blogs to a determine how fashion is viewed by scholars, especially as a communicative tool in relation to identity, as well as how an interdisciplinary approach enriches the study of fashion and communication.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The evolution of the melanocortin receptor (MCR) gene family has been dictated by two genome duplication events (2R hypothesis).  The gnathostomes are thus predicted to possess a minimum of four MCR genes.  Previous studies on cartilaginous fish have shown evidence for the presence of only three MCRs.  The purpose of this thesis is to functionally express the MC5R from the spiny dogfish (&lt;italic&gt;Squalus acanthias&lt;/italic&gt;) and the putative MC2R and MC3R from the elephant shark (&lt;italic&gt;Callorhinchus milii&lt;/italic&gt;); these receptors have not yet been fully characterized.  In this study, SacMC5R was able to be expressed in CHO cells without the presence of an accessory protein, like MRAP.  This receptor showed a preference for ACTH over α-MSH, and, even though SacMC5R showed no requirement for MRAP, co-transfection with mouse MRAP led to an increase in receptor sensitivity to ACTH.  CmiMC3R was also found to have the highest sensitivity to ACTH.  This receptor was able to be expressed without MRAP, but receptor activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of mouse MRAP.  Functional analysis of CmiMC2R showed that this receptor was able to be trafficked to the cell surface and functionally expressed without MRAP; furthermore, the presence of MRAP did not appear to enhance activation.  It was also found that while CmiMC2R had the greatest affinity for ACTH, it was also able to be stimulated by all of the MSHs.  Analysis of the MCRs in these species suggests that cartilaginous fish have secondarily lost a MCR gene.  The relationship between the MC2R and MC5R in cartilaginous fish is still unresolved.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis analyzes the implications of Mexican state failure on United States national security.  The growing instability in Mexico due to the actions of the various drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), government corruption, possible human rights abuses and Mexican insurgent groups is examined in order to understand why the Mexican state may fail.This thesis explores the implications of Mexican state failure on U.S. national security by providing possible scenarios such as continued operations into the United States by Mexican drug trafficking organizations, DTO relationships with American street gangs, regional instability, possible exploitation of the Mexican homeland by terrorist organizations, U.S. economic costs, Mexican refugee flow into the United States, and foreign state intervention into Mexico.  This thesis concludes by focusing on American counter-drug policy in Latin America; the last section also provides policy recommendations for American officials.The United States has delivered tremendous amounts of money and equipment to Mexico.  The close proximity of Mexico with the United States, and the permeable border that the U.S. shares with Mexico makes this study relevant to the United States.  A Mexican failed state scenario will have an adverse effect on the national security of the United States.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>IS IT HOT(TER) OUT THERE OR IS IT JUST (THE) ME(DIA)?: A COMPARATIVE FRAMING ANALYSIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This is a framing analysis that compares the coverage of climate change in the New York Times and the Guardian from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. This research supports the theory that the coverage in media outlets is affected by the media systems in which they exists, with both similarities and differences in the coverage of the two media outlets. It also supports the argument that climate change coverage in the United States is cyclical and event-driven, while the British media reflects both the cyclical, event-driven liberal media model and the more issues-focused European model. This thesis departs from previous research in that the scientific uncertainty frame is virtually non-existent. However, it shows some progress in U.S. media coverage of climate change, especially with regards to the framing of climate change as a scientific uncertainty, assuming this is a true shift in U.S. media coverage and not simply part of the issue cycle.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Joseph Campbell, a preeminent scholar of world mythology, wrote often regarding the “ power of myth ” in our society.  Myth, which serves as a metaphor to explain the world and ourselves to ourselves, can be used to further the greater good of mankind.  It can also be used to inflict great harm and hardship.  Myth serves as either elixir or poison depending not upon he who consumes it, but upon he who conjures it.  In this essay, we will look at the lives, work and myths of two historic figures who desired nothing less than the greater glory of God and man, namely, Jesus and Socrates.  We will explore the creation of the myths surrounding Socrates and Jesus as heroes (in Campbell&apos;s sense of the &lt;italic&gt;monomyth&lt;italic&gt;) and the gifts which each gives to the world (i.e. their consonant messages of egalitarian rule, equality of the sexes, living a good life and nonviolent civil disobedience).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Highly sensitive biosensors capable of detecting and characterizing smallest quantities of cellular and molecular targets are needed in pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics industries. In this work, the importance of biological target recognition specifically proteins through microarray technologies has been discussed and the most successful tools and techniques have been studied. Moreover, a thermally actuated Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) resonator has been demonstrated and fabricated in this work as an accurate, reliable and low cost biotechnology tool. As a proof of concept, amine to epoxide coupling of octadecylamine to functionalized silicon dioxide surface have been shown through resonator frequency monitoring. The frequency deviation of the sensors implied a meaningful surface coverage after analyte immobilization. Furthermore, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the devices at different stages of the surface modification supported that the frequency deviations are due to epoxide and octadecylamine attachments. In addition, two surface passivation techniques against non-specific adsorption of avidin have been investigated on silicon surfaces</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In light of both the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage and the efforts of the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage in producing the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, it has become clear that work with intangible cultural heritage in museums necessitates staff to carry out ethnographic fieldwork among heritage communities. In order to illustrate this methodology, an ethnographic study was conducted in the Denver contra dance community to better explore conceptions of value and meaning related to the community by its members. Further, the contra dance findings point to certain issues related to defining the terms of community and sustainability, which relate to concepts illustrated by the 2003 UNESCO Convention. The different key elements of the project - museums, intangible cultural heritage, and contra dance - become linked together by considering each instance of expressive performance as the enactment of culture in the moment. The project research and paper contribute to the literature of contra dance, ethnographic dance studies, performance, museum studies, and the exhibition of intangible culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Macroeconomics after the Great Recession: Consensus or conflict?</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Unlike microeconomics where there are relatively few disagreements, the field of macroeconomics has always been the arena of several competing theories. Despite that history of conflict, in the late 1980s during the Great Moderation, the New Classicals and the New Keynesians reached an agreement, known as the New Consensus during the Great Moderation. For decades, the New Consensus has dominated macroeconomic theory and policymaking not only in the U.S., but also throughout the world. After many years of calm, however, the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis and its consequent Great Recession demonstrated that how fragile that consensus was.While the debate regarding the collapse of the consensus still continues, this thesis aims to understand the implications of the collapse in terms of the future of macroeconomic theory and of policy-making from a critical and historical perspective. To achieve this goal, this thesis will explore the rise and the fall of the New Consensus Theory by first showing, the process that successfully incorporated the once opposing ideologies into one system; second, this paper will study the collapse of the consensus soon after the arrival of the Great Recession. This is followed by a section that aims to draw some lessons learned from the failure of the New Consensus Theory. Finally, the thesis examines the problems associated with policy-making, deficiencies in economic theory and modeling, and the appropriateness of the methodology in the foundations of the New Consensus. Based on these critical and historical evaluations, the thesis concludes with some remarks concerning the future of macroeconomic theory and policy-making.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Writing at a time when women had few property rights, were given scarce educational opportunities, and were viewed as incorrigibly irrational, the largely autodidactic English intellectual Margaret Cavendish is fascinated by knowledge and how to secure for herself a place in the micro- as well as macrocosmic community of letters. In particular, Cavendish holds an abiding interest in what we now call &quot;consciousness&quot; which she attributes to every piece of matter. Throughout the universe, the three aspects of matter--inanimate, sensate, and rational--are omnipresent. While throughout all of Cavendish&apos;s eclectic literary creation, consciousness is the unifying principle. Her exploration of consciousness manifests itself across genres--in scenes from her fiction, in the themes of her poetry, in her philosophical principles, and in her explanations of the natural world. I maintain that although this is not commonly recognized, Cavendish&apos;s principle of pervasive consciousness is a premise throughout her writings.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>We provide high-resolution maps of the circumstellar dust shells of several dozen Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars using data from the &lt;italic&gt;Spitzer&lt;/italic&gt; space telescope Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) imaged at 70&amp;mu m. AGB stars are the major contributors of chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen and silicon, which are essential to the existence of life in the universe, through mass loss processes that take place at the surface of the star. We probe the spatial distribution of cold (~40 K) dust grains in order to trace the history of mass loss from the observed radial density variation in these shells. Our images illustrate that different morphologies may evolve because AGB stars can already interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) that surrounds them even at these early stages of the AGB mass loss history. Relative motion of the star as well as the ISM with respect to the local environment may be of particular importance for shell structure evolution.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Mere days before the Copenhagen Climate Summit, the main server of the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia was illegally hacked and over 3,000 documents were downloaded and released onto climate change blogs with excerpts of emails exchanged between climate change scientists that discussed manipulation of data, faulty observation techniques, and their frustration over their inability to provide solid proof that global warming was occurring. The release of these emails set off a firestorm of debate and the incident was quickly coined &quot;Climate-gate.&quot;This study examines the ensuing media coverage by CNN and Fox News and seeks to understand the narrative of the event that was provided to the American public. An analysis of the coverage of Climate-gate by two major American news media organizations offers new and interesting insight into the nature of the partisan-based divide that characterizes public opinion regarding the issues of global warming and climate change in the United States.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Memory Access Patterns for Cellular Automata Using GPGPUs</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Today&apos;s graphical processing units have hundreds of individual processing cores that can be used for general purpose computation of mathematical and scientific problems.  Due to their hardware architecture, these devices are especially effective when solving problems that exhibit a high degree of spatial locality.  Cellular automata use small, local neighborhoods to determine successive states of individual elements and therefore, provide an excellent opportunity for the application of general purpose GPU computing.  However, the GPU presents a challenging environment because it lacks many of the features of traditional CPUs, such as automatic, on-chip caching of data.  To fully realize the potential of a GPU, specialized memory techniques and patterns must be employed to account for their unique architecture.  Several techniques are presented which not only dramatically improve performance, but, in many cases, also simplify implementation.  Many of the approaches discussed relate to the organization of data in memory or patterns for accessing that data, while others detail methods of increasing the computation to memory access ratio.  The ideas presented are generic, and applicable to cellular automata models as a whole.  Example implementations are given for several problems, including the Game of Life and Gaussian blurring, while performance characteristics, such as instruction and memory accesses counts, are analyzed and compared.  A case study is detailed, showing the effectiveness of the various techniques when applied to a larger, real-world problem.  Lastly, the reasoning behind each of the improvements is explained, providing general guidelines for determining when a given technique will be most and least effective.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Minorities in Israel: Mizrahi and Israeli-Arab Identity and the Potential for Political Collaboration</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the minority status of Mizrahim and Israeli-Arabs and their political narrative, identity, and action, including their divergent and collaborative views of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process. I examined the possibility that minority groups, once established as viable separate collectives with some leverage and political narrative, have just cause for combining their political action in order to influence governing elites. In order to explore this question, I investigated whether the factor of shared grievances in social identity formation provides a basis for multi-group political narrative and subsequent collaborative action in confronting dominant political forces, the results of which could bring pressure for change. On the basis of scholarly literature and an analysis of political activity, I discovered that political narrative and identity are interactive for both Mizrahi and Israeli-Arab collectives and that many features which affected the development of both are similar if not shared between the two groups. Despite this, Mizrahim and Israeli-Arabs have developed two autonomous political narratives and identities and therefore, their expressions of political action are divergent. Therefore, I conclude that shared grievances are not sufficient in uniting minority groups to act collaboratively for heightened political influence.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis develops a model of structural power in society that builds upon Weber&apos;s notion that several types of power exist in societies and that these types of power operate differently within societies. The purpose of this model is to help explain the political economy of development during Museveni&apos;s tenure. The thesis argues that Museveni has centralized power through a complex system of patronage and repression. Furthermore, Museveni&apos;s transformation from the leader of a cadre of `new breed leaders&apos; to `just another African big man&apos; results from his choice to centralize power as a means of achieving his revolutionary goals. While this thesis explains how this centralization occurred it does not explain why. The final chapter investigates some theoretical frameworks to explain why it has occurred. The thesis concludes by noting that a combination of these frameworks and the model developed herein offer several avenues for possible further research.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Russian Federation&apos;s reliance on nuclear weapons for national security will steadily increase over time. Based on current evidence and historical data, the Russian state will be unable to recruit, arm, train, equip, reform, and fund their conventional forces well enough to match up with capabilities of what it views to be its potential adversaries. Russia&apos;s historic experience with invasion and vulnerable geographic position reinforce the need for a powerful weapon with which to maintain the current regime and ensure its territorial integrity. Declining demographics and persistent social illnesses will reduce the number of eligible male candidates able to serve in the military. Also, Russia&apos;s leaders perceive a threat environment in which there are persistent threats to the existence of the Russian Federation. Finally, nuclear weapons provide a relatively cheap and effective weapon that possesses massive destructive capability, is easily deployable, and demands respect from any potential adversary.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Opportunity Structures and Post-authoritarian Participation: Argentina and Chile Compared</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This work seeks to address a paradox between the existing literature on political disaffection and participation in new democracies through a comparative study of Chile and Argentina.  According to Torcal and Lago (2006), disaffection in new democracies is associated with less conventional and nonconventional forms of participation.  While on an individual basis their conclusions hold true in Chile and Argentina, the comparisons on a national level do not fit this pattern - despite the higher levels of disaffection in Argentina, it has similar or higher levels of participation.  This paper employs Sidney Tarrow&apos;s theoretical framework of opportunity structures (1994, 1995) to test the causal pathway from the transitions to democracy to current participation, concluding that:  1) that the type of transition results in context-specific institutional and perceptional opportunity structures that facilitate some types of participation and inhibit others, which, in the case of the Chilean controlled transition led to primarily electoral participation, compared to the induced transition in Argentina that allowed for all types of participation; and 2) that the repertoires of post-authoritarian participation formed after the transition interact with current political institutions to create current opportunity structures that produce different characteristics of political participation - almost exclusively electoral in Chile, compared to a broader variety and number of participants in Argentina.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>By examining two memoirs written by Virginia Woolf and one memoir written by her father, Leslie Stephen, along with Woolf&apos;s novel, &lt;italic&gt;To the Lighthouse&lt;/italic&gt;, I will investigate the memoir genre, particularly in the context of understanding a shared history. These four texts provide a means of analyzing how texts form a discourse and what can be learned when conversational roles are determined. By grouping these four works together, one can better understand the rich genre of memoir, while also getting a glimpse of the powerful complexity and narrative intricacies of the Woolf/Stephen family conversation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Convergent extension is a highly conserved process among mammals, in which the tissue narrows in one axis, and extends across another. Tissue elongation is directed by the regulation of cell interface behaviors, which guides cell intercalation and rosette formation. Rosette formation occurs through the contraction of vertically oriented cell interfaces, and the subsequent elongation of new horizontal interfaces. It has been shown that actomyosin-generated tension functions to direct rosette formation. In this thesis, I have tested the function of regulators of F-actin networks, as well as endocytic and exocytic mechanisms, to identify new components that control interface behaviors and cell shape. I have performed a screen of F-actin regulators and nucleators, and pinpointed the specific actin nucleator dPod-1 as a candidate protein that is localized to vertical interfaces during tissue elongation. Furthermore, I have probed the function of endocytosis using the Shibire mutation, and demonstrated that endocytosis is required for vertical interface shrinking. Finally, I have used mutations in components of the Exocyst Complex and the associated protein RalA to inhibit exocytic mechanisms, in order to address their function in directing cell and tissue morphologies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project compares the operational methods of three of Cole Swensen&apos;s books of poetry (Such Rich Hour, Try, and Goest) with ways in which the human mind and consciousness function.  I use Daniel Dennett&apos;s Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness, as described in Consciousness Explained, alongside concepts presented in several other philosophical works (from both analytic and continental traditions), to demonstrate that significant similarities exist between the operations of poetry and consciousness in general, and that these operational similarities are especially noticeable in Swensen&apos;s work.   This thesis examines several operational modes that are present within the human mind (intentionality, phenomenological perception, a materialist process of formation, etc.), as they are contingent upon the Multiple Drafts Model, and constructs a theory of how these same concepts and principles function within Swensen&apos;s poetic texts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis examines how the methods of transmedia storytelling emerging in the entertainment industry might be used in a journalism context. Journalism is facing many crises, not the least of which is a loss of readership and perceived relevance to its public. Presented with an ever-expanding array of media with which to interact, the public is more difficult to attract to a socially relevant issue or a politically important story. Faced with similar issues, the entertainment industry has developed a means to engage with fans in a way that draws them across multiple media platforms, better captures their imagination and engages them personally into the story being told. Transmedia Storytelling lets narrative unfold on multiple lines, from varying perspectives and with the help of the fans themselves. Scholars of the methodology describe it as the art of world building.This thesis illustrates that journalists can better engage their publics by adapting the methods of transmedia storytelling to journalism. By comparing entertainment transmedia storytelling theory and technique with examples of journalism that illustrate one or more of these techniques, this thesis explores whether journalists can reach more individuals, achieve better engagement and participation from their publics and more thoroughly communicate the complexity and context of any story.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>POWER AND HUMILIATION IN FOREIGN POLICY: THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This thesis analyzes the use and unintended outcomes of power in international politics through an examination of economic sanctions in selected countries.  A theoretical argument is derived from punishment theories and analyzes the effects of punishment on the target, including subjugation, humiliation and resistance.  Seven cases of economic sanctions are studied: Cuba, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Iran where the United States, either unilaterally or as the leader of a coalition, sought to influence political outcomes in the target state, such as regime change or curbing WMD proliferation.  Economic sanctions were generally unsuccessful in achieving the expected outcomes and instead generated unintended results, such as: strengthening existing leadership and forcing negative humanitarian consequences on the population of the target state.  Outcomes of punishment lead to humiliation and blowback against the United States, the sender state.  The central argument is that power exercised by a strong state against a weaker state often generates resistance to punishment, because unintended outcomes occur.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Products of their Environment? Nuclear Proliferation and the Emerging Multipolar International System</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The world is shifting from a unipolar system following the end of the Cold War to a multipolar system that is ushered in by &quot;the rise of the rest.&quot;  This change in the global structure has led some analysts to predict an increase in nuclear weapons proliferation caused by increased uncertainty and a decrease in alliances and security assurances.  Nuclear proliferation, however, will not increase because these types of predictions are founded upon realist assumptions that inaccurately predict the characteristics of the emerging multipolar system as well as inaccurately understanding calculations of states with regard to nuclear weapons programs.  I review a variety of literature concerning international politics theory and nuclear weapons forming a theoretical framework and use Iran and Turkey as case studies to test my hypothesis.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>As a result of dissimilarity in lung morphometry and physiological conditions, therapeutic aerosol particles deposit differently in humans of various ages and body weights.  These particles also deposit differently in non-human species that are often utilized in inhalation and dosing studies.  The focus of this work is to determine the optimal particle size and deposition (traditional efficiency and volume-weighted) of therapeutic particles in humans of both genders ranging in age from 3 months old to 21 years old and three non-human species (&lt;italic&gt;B6C3F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/italic&gt; mouse, Long-Evans hooded rat, and Beagle dog).  This study finds that in humans, both optimal particle size and volume-weighted deposition are age and weight dependent; as age and weight increase, optimal particle size and deposition increase.  Also, for all ages, breathing rates that are lower than normal enhance volume-weighted deposition and shift optimal particle size.  Additionally, a rigorous sensitivity analysis of breathing rate and particles diameter on deposition shows that at normal breathing rates, sensitivity to breathing rate is greater than sensitivity to particle diameter for young children, but sensitivities to both become similar as age/body weight increase.  At optimal breathing rates, the sensitivity to both breathing rate and particle diameter are lowest at the optimal breathing rates for children; for healthy adults, however, there is no apparent difference in sensitivity at normal and optimal breathing rates.  This study also found that the mouse represents infants and young children relatively well, the rat represents older children relatively well, and the canine likely represents adolescents well.  In addition, numerous studies postulate that the use of heliox instead of air will improve deposition as a result of the differences in density and dynamic viscosity; therefore, this study evaluates the effects of heliox based upon the differences in these properties.  The results indicate that based on these properties, heliox does not appear to have any significant effect on deposition.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current state of declining audiences for the performing arts in the United States is cause for concern for those musicians and ensembles interested in the continuation of the art forms.  The previous model of using audience numbers as the sole or primary measure of an orchestra&apos;s success is no longer sufficient in an era of participatory design and interactive experiences.  Through observation and analysis of the culture of classical music, this study focuses on the emerging visions of participatory culture and the ways in which museum anthropology and game design theory can be used to redefine classical music literacy and audience development in terms of interaction and participatory design.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The term `God&apos; may be understood as the desire for the complete epistemological condition of thought; language expresses this condition in statements of `meaning.&apos;  `Religion&apos; expresses this desire in texts and ritual practice which may be examined by in  academic study; however, because the `third term&apos; of religio is understood as the condition of being `bounded to or by,&apos; the study of religion is itself bounded to or by this desire for the completion of thought.  This desire cannot be understood as an `alterity&apos; of thought but is rather the internal native or `alter-native&apos; condition of thought itself.  Religions are the native residences of this desire, and claim to know the complete condition; however, alter-natively, because thought cannot completely restrict but rather remains itself an expression of the condition, human thought and its culture are open to an unrestricted examination of the expressions of the condition.  Each religion expresses itself as a `singularity&apos; of this universal condition of thought; however, because of the native factors in the epistemological condition, specifically, that thought desires but cannot fully express or know the condition, no particular religion can claim hegemony to the expression of the condition:  `God&apos; as such is the full expression of thought, yet by the definition of the terms of thought, its expression remains fully its alter-native exception of thought.The thesis first considers the possibility of theory itself through a brief examination of etymological gaps and windows evident in its expression.   Next, we examine a possible working theory for the study of religion and the epistemological implications arising from its expression.  Thirdly, as a result of these two courses, we examine the semantic and semiotic conditions of what can be `called&apos; `meaning.&apos;  The thesis concludes with proposed epistemological strategies for the study of culture and religion, including what are termed the eccentric semantic and semiotic loops, the potentiation of meaning in the instantiation and disinstantiation of language figurations, singularity in meaning expressions, and the unique singularity of religious meaning in what may be termed the &quot;exceptional inception&quot; of thought.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Santo Toribio (1900-28) was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in 2000 as a martyr of Mexico&apos;s bloody Cristero Rebellion. He enjoyed a modest local following for decades after the Rebellion as many of the other Cristero martyr-saints did. However, around the time of his canonization, a new identity began to emerge different from that of martyr; he became the patron saint of immigration. For believers, Santo Toribio helps mitigate the criminal nature of this act by showing God&apos;s approval and blessing. He places the pain and social distortion of Border crossing in Roman Catholic contexts of holiness and divine intervention. This thesis begins to catalog and analyze the nature of Santo Toribio&apos;s unofficial patronage.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The objective of this research was the evaluation and forensic validation of Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) as a sequencing-independent means of detecting the presence of sequence differences in pair-wise mixtures of non-concordant amplicons of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The reproducibility and efficacy of DHPLC results, including amplification reproducibility, injection reproducibility, and column-to-column reproducibility were measured, showing negligible assay-to-assay variability.  In addition, cross-contamination on the DHPLC columns demonstrated very low level DNA carryover between a high-abundance sample and subsequent zero-volume injections.The accuracy with which DHPLC technology can be used to screen both evidence and control samples in the context of a forensic laboratory was evaluated.  This was demonstrated by a number of pair-wise comparisons of each of the forensically relevant amplicons from 95 unrelated individuals in the study, and was in 100% agreement with sequencing data.  Thus, DHPLC can be used to detect a diversity of sequence differences (transitions, transversions, insertions and deletions) in the mtDNA D-loop. Accordingly, DHPLC may have utility as a presumptive indicator of mtDNA sequence concordance samples.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis presents work done simulating a type of organic neuromorphic architecture, modeled after Artificial Neural Network, and termed Synthetic Neural Network, or SNN. The first major contribution of this thesis is development of a single-transistor-single-organic-bistable-device-per-input circuit that approximates behavior of an artificial neuron. The efficacy of this design is validated by comparing the behavior of a single synthetic neuron to that of an artificial neuron as well as two examples involving a network of synthetic neurons. The analysis utilizes electrical characteristics of polymer electronic elements, namely Organic Bistable Device and Organic Field Effect Transistor, created in the laboratory at University of Denver. Polymer electronics is a new branch of electronics that is based on conductive and semi-conductive polymers. These new elements hold a great advantage over the inorganic electronics in the form of physical flexibility and low cost of fabrication. However, their device variability between individual devices is also much greater. Therefore the second major contribution of this thesis is the analysis of resilience of neural networks subjected to physical damage and other manufacturing faults.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>At present the main source of our power and energy needs are from fossil fuel; almost all transportation tools and nearly 70% of electrical power are produced by fossil fuel. But unfortunately these materials are limited in our planet, with obvious drawback such as pollution. So looking for new kinds of energy supply is an urgent matter. Solar-powered photovoltaic system provides a clean energy solution to this problem. It is developing fast all over the world in terms of both research work and actual applications. It is estimated that the power supplied by solar energy can provide 10 percent of United States power needs. This thesis mainly discusses photovoltaic system modeling from the beginning of site selection to system sizing. Some tools are used during the project. A GIS application is used to help developers in the preliminary studies. Photovoltaic system simulation software PVsyst involves the system components setting and sizing process. Two types of systems are built in this study: stand-alone system and grid connected system; the location is set at Denver, Colorado. For each system the array mounting, analysis of loads and modules selection are studied. The simulation is performed after the system model is completed, the results includes loss diagrams, system energy yields and system efficiencies. At last the economic analysis and comparison between the two types of PV systems is analyzed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Specialty Service Lines in the United States Hospital System: Old Wine, New Bottles</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The emergence of specialty service lines in the United States health care system presents many significant questions regarding the access to, provision of, and financing of healthcare. In general terms, specialty service lines represent the newest development in several important trends in the American hospital system and reflect important trends in the wider economy. Many claims have been made regarding the effect of physician-owned specialty hospitals, from their exemption from self-referral prohibitions, their diversion of services away from general hospitals that use high profit margins to subsidize the &quot;safety net,&quot; and concerns regarding the over-provision of technologically complex treatments in a system already heavily weighted in favor of specialized medicine. This study will examine the claims made about the differences of physician-owned specialty heart hospitals serving Medicare patients. In doing so, it will employ hierarchical linear modeling, the results of which indicate that specialty service lines may not deliver higher quality care at a lower cost when compared to their general hospital competitors. Rather, there are several significant factors in the hospital market, health insurance market, and demographic features of the population that both groups serve that may have even more notable effects. Because of these complications, this study finally shows the possibility for a dialectical movement resulting from the inadequacies of the argument up to that point, implying further avenues of research on the social character of the commodity of healthcare.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The tools and techniques of structured finance have changed banking remarkably over the past twenty years. This area grew to become larger than the sum total of traditional banking deposits in 2007. Despite this, the field is poorly understood and its connection to macroeconomic stability was underestimated until the credit crisis. This paper explores the structured finance market in three phases. First, the market is broken into parts based on the incentives and motivations of each of the three major agents in the field. Next, a critical review of pricing models that are used to justify the valuations of the products of structured finance is discussed using actual market data. Finally, the connection between structured finance and the real economy is explored. It is the conclusion of this paper that structured finance can increase economic efficiency, but thus far the risks that its employment create are greater than their benefit.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis is examines how the perception of a sub-culture can be altered by adominant culture. Specifically this project addresses the effects resulting from theassimilation of Hip Hop Culture by mainstream culture in the United States, and itssubsequent use as a marketing tool. Because Hip Hop Culture originated in BlackCulture, the perception of Black Culture as reflected by hip hop music is also discussed.All of these themes are addressed creatively through a narrative script project.</dc:description>

Fisher&apos;s socio-historic role and the components of her  texts as a means to interrogate the categorization of her writing, to identify her authorial voice, and to see how it all contributes to and proves that Fisher is a `kaleidoscopic&apos; hybrid writer. I utilize theoretical positions such as New Historicism, Feminism, Genre Theory, and Everyday Theory to help me identify and explain the hybrid tendencies of Fisher&apos;s writing. It is not a comprehensive study of her texts in light of these theories, but rather, it is a broad overview in order to demonstrate alternative readings of Fisher&apos;s work.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Public space researchers have created a body of literature describing how women feel in and access public spaces and have briefly explored men and race in public space, but have not explored other identities adequately including sexuality. Geographical queer theory provides a foundation for public space research, but literature is limited to the creation of and contest over space. The goal of this research is to explore LGBT feelings in public spaces in St. Louis, MO. There are three components including a survey, interviews, and hand mapping of emotional associations within the city. Overall, feelings in public space were found to be dependent on an individual&apos;s life experiences but several other important themes emerged, such as LGBT spaces as comfortable; the city, parks and familiar spaces as safe; bars as important spaces; behavior modification in unsafe situations; the importance of alcohol to safety; &quot;hick&quot; areas as dangerous; race as a separating factor; and upscale areas as uncomfortable. This research informs public space and queer theory literatures, while also developing hand mapping techniques.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Catastrophic natural disasters remain a constant and recurring mortal threat to people around the world.  Since prevention of the events themselves is impossible, it is important to examine those factors which can reduce the loss of life and enable successful recovery.  We intuitively expect good governance to be one of these factors.  This paper discusses the concepts of governance and long-term disaster recovery and the difficulties inherent in numerically capturing these qualities.  It explores the correlation between governance indicators and three development and economic measurements of recovery.  Three case studies are used to qualitatively and anecdotally address the topic.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Central Asia has emerged on the global stage after spending decades in isolation.  As developing nations, most of Central Asia possesses the resources to spur rapid development.  Things would seem to be in the region&apos;s favor.  There are, however, a few events that could derail the region.Afghanistan is on the periphery of the region and presents a series of difficult dilemmas such as creating a functioning government from a country that has been at war for nearly 30 years, the problem of the insurgency in the south, and narcotics trafficking.Water is scarce in the region, the leaders cannot agree on a water sharing treaty, and the downstream and upstream nations have different water usage needs and patterns.Lastly, Uzbekistan presents some challenges due to its centrality in the region, clan infighting, the unresolved issue of succession, and the tenuous stability in the country.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Social Determinants of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia: Is it too Early to Call Micro Medical Efforts a Success?</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Cambodia, a least developed country (LDC) with a recent history of civil war and genocide, has been widely considered to be a success story when it comes to the fight against HIV/AIDS. Within a few years of the first HIV positive blood test in the kingdom in 1991, it quickly became the country with the highest prevalence in the region, with estimates of as many as 4% of the population being infected at one point.In recent years, Cambodia&apos;s HIV/AIDS infection rates have plummeted to below 1%, with most of the credit being given to the implementation of micro-medical measures, such as a 100% condom use campaign among sex workers and clean needle programs. While these steps are necessary, and undoubtedly beneficial, a closer examination of the underlying social and economic factors that helped spur the initial epidemic - the social determinants of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia - suggest that the fight may be far from over. In fact, ongoing structural changes in the Cambodian economy may be placing Cambodians at a higher risk for contracting the disease. Accordingly, in this study, we examine the social determinants of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia, as well as possible implications for the future.Through a review of the primary underlying determinants of HIV/AIDS - we find that there may be greater cause for concern than available data suggests.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Use of English-Language Internet Propaganda by the Taliban Insurgency in Afghanistan, 2007 - 2010</dc:title>

  <dc:description>After nearly a decade of war in Afghanistan, military and government officials have described the propaganda efforts of the Taliban insurgency as increasingly sophisticated and effective. These statements fail to distinguish between insurgent propaganda efforts at the local level and those carried out online and targeted at Western populations. This research investigates the effectiveness of the Taliban&apos;s use of English-language media to reach Western populations and shape their own image in a way that furthers their strategic objectives. An analytical approach that combines quantitative analysis performed on a set of Taliban messages from 2007 to 2010 and a deeper, qualitative assessment of a subset of those messages provides insight into the trends and themes within Taliban messaging. This approach shows an unsophisticated Taliban English-language propaganda effort that, despite showing recent signs of potential improvement, has failed to shape its image in support of its strategic objectives, focusing its efforts instead on violent and reactionary messages and following a narrative driven by the Western and international media.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Transforming Atypical Challenges into Innovative Solutions: a gendered analysis of the UN Interagency Rehabilitation Program in Nepal</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Nearly five years after signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended ten years of civil war in Nepal, key issues are still unresolved and political progress on implementation has been slow at its best. While every disarmament demobilization and reintegration (DDR) operation is unique, Nepal&apos;s DDR process has included atypical conditions such as no government support, continued military command over program participants, an unusually long time spent in cantonments prior to discharge, and the absence of an adequate pre-planning phase. This analysis is presented in the form of a case study and examines the United Nations Interagency Rehabilitation Program response to these challenges using primary documents and interviews conducted with UN staff members in Nepal. The author argues that atypical challenges acted as drivers that resulted in programmatic innovations, including dynamic monitoring and evaluation, a centralized information system, and specific gender supports, that may be applicable to more traditional DDR operations, particularly those with a large female caseload.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The implosion of the 2008 financial crisis ignited fears that integration would transmit the crisis&apos; effects throughout the global system.  Examining two countries, Bangladesh and Zambia, this project shows that low-income countries with relatively little integration also saw negative impacts. This occurred through three main transmission mechanisms: trade flows, rising prices and financial flows that could have possible long-term effects at the macro and micro level. The manner and impact of each transmission mechanism, however, varied among LICs according to each country&apos;s individual structural economic and financial vulnerabilities. Bangladesh saw a delayed impact but did not avoid the crisis completely, while Zambia saw a quick impact but recovered sooner. Where their individual cases converge, they offer recommendations for other LICs embarking on trade and financial liberalization in an interconnected but risky system.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>U.S. Foreign Policy in Lebanon: Adapting to Regional Threats Today and Promoting Stability for the Future</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Since the 1800s, the United States has sought to advance its interests in what currently exists as the Lebanese Republic.  This assessment will look at the shape that policy has taken since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war in the context of historical relations.  After doing so, three questions will be addressed: What have been the policies of Iran and Syria toward Lebanon during this time period, how effective has U.S. policy been since 2006 in undermining Iranian and Syrian influence and what policies should the United States adopt to offset future destabilizing influence from these countries.  It is concluded that the current policy suffers from substantial contradictions and shortcomings in addressing the Syrian and Iranian threats, particularly regarding Hezbollah.  A new policy in the form of enhanced military and developmental support is advocated, as are steps to encourage rapprochement between Lebanon and its neighbors.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>During the summer of 2010, formative field research was collected in Kibera, Africa&apos;s largest urban informal settlement, located in Nairobi, Kenya. Research explored how a Western-developed behavior-change theoretical model could be applied in a developing country. Data was collected through focus groups, a case study and direct observations. Recommendations were made for an intervention to reduce the incidence of childhood diarrhea. A campaign was proposed that promoted consistent and sustainable use of the Safe Water System, that is, point-of-use drinking water treatment and safe drinking water storage. Results revealed that it was indeed feasible to apply the Western model, Theory of Planned Behavior as the campaign&apos;s theoretical framework, so long as the following issues were addressed: First, barriers had to be reduced to enable positive attitudes and self-efficacy. Second, normative behaviors and beliefs had to be assessed through Kenya&apos;s societal norms - including its collectivist culture and high-context communication style. Normative behaviors were recommended to be designed directly into the campaign structure through a woman&apos;s group train-the-trainer program that utilized peer education, behavioral modeling, and motivational interviewing principles. This paper adds to the research literature in two ways. It encourages future SWS interventions to utilize behavior-change theory and formative research in order to explain current behaviors and identify strategies that promote sustainable behavior change. Second and more importantly, this thesis adds to the existing research pertaining to the use of the Theory of Planned Behavior in the developing world. Although the theory was designed and perhaps intended for application in Western cultures, if assessed through a cultural lens the theory shows efficacy in other cultures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Video stabilization removes unwanted motion from video sequences, often caused by vibrations or other instabilities. This improves video viewability and can aid in detection and tracking in computer vision algorithms. We have developed a digital video stabilization process using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features for tracking motion between frames. These features provide information about location and orientation in each frame. The orientation information is generally not available with other features, so we employ this knowledge directly in motion estimation. We use a fuzzy clustering scheme to separate the SIFT features representing camera motion from those representing the motion of moving objects in the scene. Each frame&apos;s translation and rotation is accumulated over time, and a Kalman filter is applied to estimate the desired motion. We provide experimental results from several video sequences using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and qualitative analysis to demonstrate the results of each design decision we made in the development of this video stabilization method.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Following recent trends in scholarship that establish museums as complex sites where representations of Native American cultures are actively negotiated, this thesis explores the relationship between representational strategies and the employment of critical Indigenous methodologies by museum institutions in the display of Navajo weavings. A postcolonial theoretical framework is utilized to analyze six Navajo weaving exhibition installments over the past decade. Additionally, a critical reflection is offered about the development of the author&apos;s collaborative exhibition, &lt;italic&gt;Na&apos;ashjé&apos;ii Biką&apos; Biyiin (Chant of the Male Spider): A Holistic Journey with Diné Weaver Roy Kady&lt;/italic&gt;, that reveals both the rewards and challenges of collaborative exhibition making between two members of the Navajo community. This study problematizes the historical process of museum representation and suggests a more nuanced investigation of the collaborative dynamics that contribute towards the decolonizing efforts in Native scholarship and museum practice.</dc:description>
