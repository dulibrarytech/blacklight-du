  <dc:description>Author: Linda SorensonTitle: A CASE STUDY OF REFORM AT ONE URBAN HIGH SCHOOLAdvisor: Susan KorachDegree Date: August 2009AbstractOur schools in America are in crisis. At particular risk are poor and minority students who attend high schools in urban areas. With so many urban high schools failing, reformers have sought ways to improve schools and increase student achievement. Effort toward urban high school reform is occurring across the United States. What happens to a school during the process of reform?The purpose of this case study was to describe the significant events and changes that characterize one urban high school&apos;s reform efforts and analyze stakeholders&apos; perceptions about the reform themes found in the researcher literature on high school reform: leadership, students&apos; academic readiness for high school, instruction and school culture.The results of this descriptive qualitative single case study (Yin, 2003) describe lessons learned from the reform efforts at Star High School. The researcher chronologically organized documents and archival records and described the events and changes made during the reform efforts. The researcher also interviewed ten participants in the reform who represented all stakeholders. The role of the researcher was that of participant-observer.Findings revealed that the reform events were implementations of a plethora of programs and strategies rather than a systemic effort of reform. The efforts to build a coalition of support amongst all stakeholders resulted in a political struggle for power andiiicontrol. This struggle derailed the reform efforts at Star High School. The findings also revealed that the multiplicity of programs and strategies, led to a lack of consistency and cohesive focus needed to guide teachers toward effective instruction. The struggles for power and lack of focus resulted in a culture of blame and politics. The passion that all stakeholders shared about providing a better education for its students was compromised by power struggles and it turned into an emotionally painful experience. This study portrayed the complexity of high school reform and informed leaders of the realities and potential pitfalls of leading school reform in a politically charged environment.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A CLASH OF WORLDVIEWS: THE IMPACT OF MODERN WESTERN NOTION OF PROGRESS ON INDIGENOUS NAGA CULTURE</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The term &quot;progress&quot; is a modern Western notion that life is always improving and advancing toward an ideal state. It is a vital modern concept which underlies geographic explorations and scientific and technological inventions as well as the desire to harness nature in order to increase human beings&apos; ease and comfort. With the advent of Western colonization and to the great detriment of the colonized, the notion of progress began to perniciously and pervasively permeate across cultures.During the classical colonial period, Western anthropologists, sociologists and others had hypothesized, or at least ardently bought into the notion, that human beings, culturally speaking, progressed from animism, to polytheism, to monotheism, and maybe beyond, to atheism. Animism, the designated religion of Indigenous Peoples, was considered the most primitive and savage form of cultural practices among human beings. Likewise, cultural evolution theorists claim that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more civilized over time. They determined that the culture and technology of the West illustrated the most advanced progress as opposed to indigenous culture which represented the most backward and primitive form of existing cultures.The interaction between the Nagas and the West, beginning with British military conquest, followed by American missionary intrusion of Naga soil, has resulted in the decimation of Naga culture. Consequences are still being felt in the lack of sense of direction and confusion among Nagas today. And as other indigenous peoples whose recent history is characterized by the traumatic cultural disruption caused by colonial interference, the Nagas have long engaged in self-shame, self-negation and self-sabotage.Well before there was a United Kingdom or United States of America Naga culture was thriving. However, when the Euro-Americans colonizers, ethnographers and missionaries, with their notion of unilinear progress and cultural evolution, came into contact with the Naga culture they had no appreciation for it. Accordingly, they stereotyped and demonized the Nagas and their culture and were determined to impose Western values thereby precipitating the demise of Naga culture. Euro-American colonialism, with its wholesale imposition of new political, religious, intellectual and cultural values, is responsible for the gradual demise of Naga culture, and it is almost a cliché to assert that since the colonial contact, the long evolved Naga traditional values are being replaced by Western values.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Computer Science Approach to Identify and Classify Hyperactivated Spermatozoa</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Effective Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) relies in part upon accurate but easily conducted measurements of sperm motion parameters.  Several established methods are widely used to assess possible reasons for male infertility, in human and veterinary Andrology clinics. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) devices quantitatively assess sperm motion parameters, which have been defined by the World Health Organization, and include the percentage of motile cells in a sample and the motion characteristics of individual cells, such as curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP) and straight line velocity (VSL). However, CASA analyses fail to define hyperactive sperm motility or determine the prevalence of hyperactively motile sperm in the sample.  Hyperactively motile sperm swim in an erratic pattern, and this occurs only at the very end of sperm capacitation, a series of biochemical changes occurring in a sperm which enables it to fertilize an oocyte. The computational challenge for detecting hyperactivated sperm motility lies in precisely modeling sperm movement changes that accurately reflect the sperm&apos;s biomedical function, by developing an algorithm that detects and classifies these unique motility patterns. Currently, no such algorithms reliably classify hyperactivated spermatozoa. Therefore, several methods to automatically identify and classify hyperactivated spermatozoa trajectories are described and their performance compared to &apos;the gold standard&apos; of visual classification, by experts.The methods considered were: two existing methods, a mathematical modification to one of these, and three new methods, each examined independently and then two were combined to produce an integrated approach.Evaluation of each method was performed by using each to analyze an initial data set containing tracks of hyperactivated and progressive sperm, which had been classified by experts in the field, and then to analyze data sets obtained from actual laboratory samples. Classifications as well as misclassifications were recorded in diffusion matrices. Two methods, the Minimum Bounding Square Ratio (MBSR) and the Rotated Rectangular Linearity (RRL) were more effective in accurately detecting hyperactivated sperm and were similar in correctly classifying hyperactivated sperm.  However, RRL misclassified twice as many sperm as MBSR. MBSR also outperformed the other methods in correctly classifying progressively motile sperm and sperm exhibiting transitional motility.After developing this algorithm, it was applied to evaluate sperm from a large experiment to determine if sperm treated with different phosphodiesterase inhibitors, used in erectile dysfunction drugs, exhibit sperm motility.  The experiment would not have been possible without these new computer algorithms. Taken together, this research demonstrates that newly developed algorithms can be used to identify critically important features of  sperm, such as hyperactivity. One algorithm, MBSR may become an important tool improving Assisted Reproductive Technology&apos;s success</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study addresses questions about the nature of relationships between personal and professional value systems and between personal and professional identities, about motivations for engaging in a social work community of practice, and about alternative statistical methods for evaluating the psychometric properties of an original measure of motivation for participation in a social work community of practice.  By merging communities of practice theory, derived from social learning theory, and critical social realist theory, this study bridges an ideological gap between the origins and evolution of personal and social identities. The study utilizes a mixed-method approach to (1) develop a measure of motivations for participating in a community of practice and compare confirmatory factor analysis and multidimensional item response theory in the evaluation of the measure, (2) assess a theoretically derived structural equation model relating attitudes toward diversity, endorsement of professional social work values, and motivations for entering a MSW program, and (3) develop a grounded theory of how students experience and make sense of the interaction, negotiation, and resolution of personal values about diversity, attitudes towards professional social work values, and motivations for pursuing a MSW degree. Implications are identified and discussed for (1) the field of psychometrics, (2) social work education, and (3) social work practice.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author:  Ginger C. MeyetteTitle:  A GROUNDED THEORY STUDY OF THE EXPERIENCE OF GRIEF IN THE LIVES OF LESBIANS AGE 60 AND OLDER:  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND SOCIETAL CHANGEAdvisor:  Dr. Enid CoxDegree Date:  August 2009ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study is to understand the lived experiences of self-identified lesbians age 60 and older concerning grief related to various life experiences and to develop a grounded theory related to the findings.  The purpose goes beyond describing the phenomenon of grief focusing on grief related exclusively to death loss.  The purpose includes eliciting comments about grief related to overt or covert discrimination due to ageism, sexism, and/or homophobia as well as the connection between the personal and the political in terms of what needs to change to bring about social justice.The issue of grief in the lives of older lesbians can be defined as being increasingly significant due to the fact that the many factors affecting the older lesbian population cause distress to individuals, families, and the community at large.  This phenomenon can be defined socially, politically, and economically; and many aspects of the problem cross the boundaries of these areas of definition.The methodology of the present study followed grounded theory methodology as developed by Glaser and Strauss (1999).  Sampling consisted of snowball sampling followed by theoretical sampling.  A total of 27 women participated in this study.  Data collection was conducted through 3 focus groups, 22 individual interviews, and 1 interview with an interracial lesbian couple.  Data analysis took place throughout the study.  Constant comparative analysis was used, and data analysis was assisted by use of the HyperResearch program through www.researchware.com.The grounded theory that emerged from this study showed that these older lesbians experience an underlying global, contextual grief in almost every aspect of their daily lives due to the lack of acceptance, celebration, and support of their primary relationships as well as their lesbian identity.  This grief is experienced as personal and interpersonal grief and grief due to the political climate.  Grief for many women is mitigated by positive coping strategies, support systems, and their vision for social action and change.Implications for clinical and community social work practice, social policy, and social work education are discussed.  Implications for future research are also identified, and conclusions expressing hope for the future are suggested.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>ABSTRACTParkinson&apos;s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive condition that affects the physical, emotional, and social functioning of individuals. Freed et al. (2001) conducted a double-blind sham-controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of fetal tissue transplantation of those with PD. The authors investigated the effects of the surgery across the dimensions of physical and neurological functioning. A quality of life (QoL) study was conducted to determine if there were differences in QoL when comparing those who received the fetal tissue transplantation to those who received the sham surgery (McRae et al., 2004).While there is little research on the effectiveness of fetal tissue transplantation as a treatment for PD, there is even less literature on longitudinal effects of this treatment. This study examined the longitudinal trajectory of change in QoL since participants received fetal transplant surgery 10-12 years ago. Participants included 11 people who were in the parent (Freed et al., 2001) and original QoL (McRae, 2004) studies. Participants completed a questionnaire that measured the dimensions of QoL along with a personality inventory, the NEO-FFI. Data gathered from the questionnaires were compared to baseline, one-year, and two-year information on the same participants. Trajectory of change in QoL and personality was assessed with a repeated measures analysis of variance.For the present study, significant changes over time were found for the Physical functioning (p &lt; .05) and Emotional functioning (p &lt; .10) dimensions of QoL. A significant result was also found for the Social functioning (p &lt; .05) dimension of QoL that was measured by the Social Provisions Scale. In addition, significant results were found for the Neuroticism (p &lt; .10), Extraversion (p &lt; .05), Openness to Experiences (p &lt; .05), and Conscientiousness (p &lt; .10) factors of the NEO-FFI. Participants reported a decrease in Physical, Emotional, and Social functioning between the two-year and current assessments. Participants reported an increase in Neuroticism, and a decrease in Extraversion, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness between the two-year and current assessments. Findings of the current study provided longitudinal information on the trajectories of fetal tissue transplantation on QoL and personality for participants with PD.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to describe, interpret and analyze the experiences of six elementary principals in the Stewart district who have effectively balanced the instructional and managerial roles of the principalship. The research question for this study is: How do effective principals balance managerial tasks and instructional leadership responsibilities? By analyzing these experiences, principals would be able to provide valuable insights into principal&apos;s needs and feelings about instructional leadership. This study centers around six elementary principals that provided information regarding the skills needed to become an instructional leader and their interpretation of experiences that contributed to their development as a successful instructional leader.This qualitative research study using phenomenology methods focused on research questions about principals&apos; feelings, knowledge, and actions around how to balance managerial duties and instructional leadership practices. Several interviews and a shadowing of each participant gave principals the opportunity to identify instructional leadership strategies used to create a successful learning environment. The researcher conducted, recorded, transcribed, and evaluated the interviews with selected elementary principals. Principals participated in a shadowing activity also. The researcher analyzed the results for repeating themes regarding problems and potential solutions to achieve balance between management and instructional leadership among interviewed principals. The study used the results of principal interview data and the shadowing data to determine the balance between managerial and instructional responsibilities.Several emerging themes surfaced from this study. The emerging themes included principals having a teaching background, collaboration, setting goals and planning, prioritizing instructional tasks, arranging meetings before and after school, possessing knowledge of teaching and learning, providing data analysis from central office, providing differentiated professional development and providing additional office personnel when needed. The principals in this study were &quot;applying several successful strategies: They fostered a school culture that valued shared leadership, group responsibility, and teacher professionalism. Principals prioritized their work and time to create opportunities for instructional leadership&quot; (Boris-Schacter&amp; Lange, 2005, p. 33).Principals used the following universal strategies to balance managerial tasks and instructional responsibilities restructuring schedules, delegating tasks, prioritizing time and work to create opportunities for instructional leadership, hiring people who are open-minded and flexible, fostering a school culture that values shared leadership group responsibility, and teacher professionalism. Each participant provided insights in ways to balance leadership in a productive climate.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Sense of Trust Through the Eyes of African American Doctoral Students:  An Examination of How a Predominantly White Institution of Higher Education Can Create an Environment of Inclusiveness</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This phenomenological research study explores whether trust influences the experiences of African American students, particularly those in doctoral programs at predominantly White institutions.   Recent studies suggest that colleges and universities can benefit in several ways by building and maintaining student trust.   However, the body of research typically provides a general understanding of the role and benefits of student trust in the academic arena through the eyes of White students only.  Very few studies examine the benefits of student trust for a diverse population, and even fewer address African American students enrolled in predominantly White doctoral programs.This research provides an alternative perspective of trust by identifying factors specific to African American doctoral students enrolled at the University of Denver using a conceptual framework that examines trust, invisibility and other factors.  The primary data was obtained through separate in-depth interviews with eight African American doctoral student participants who shared their experiences, thoughts and perceptions of trust at this predominantly White institution.  Narratives of four of the participants highlight their reflections and academic encounters in a racial environment.Using Creswell&apos;s (2007) approach to phenomenological analysis, four key themes emerged from the data as essential elements to establish a sense of trust:  a strong sense of Blackness, a support system, the level of visibility and the relationship with the higher education institution.  Findings from this research study suggest that race remains a salient factor for the study participants, even though a climate of inclusiveness in the classroom and strong support from faculty were described by most.  However, on-going encounters of racial slights remain prevalent today for several of the students in this study.Study results offer implications and recommendations for academic professionals and leaders that suggest a re-examination of efforts to recruit and retain African American faculty, staff and students, as well as to create inclusive excellence through leadership at every level of the institution.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Supreme Battle in Metaphor: A Critical Metaphor Analysis of the Culture War in Lawrence v. Texas</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This work explores how metaphor, specifically conceptual metaphor, is used to create the argumentative context, carry meaning, supply the enthymematic structure  of the arguments, and transform the sexual autonomy controversy within the U.S. Supreme Court&apos;s opinion in Lawrence v. Texas. Research questions that guide this work include:Is there evidence that the metaphor of &quot;culture war&quot; drives the argumentative context in the Lawrence opinion and is carried by other metaphorical constructions?How is the social controversy over sexual autonomy advanced by conceptual metaphors in this legal text?What are the dominant metaphors used to argue for sexual autonomy? What are the dominant metaphors used to resist the advance of sexual autonomy?Does Critical Metaphor Analysis add substantially to our understanding of the argumentative strategy of both sides in the controversy?Theoretical assumptions made in this study are in line with George Lakoff and Mark Johnson&apos;s conceptual metaphor theory and the embodied nature of cognition. The methodology selected to analyze the conceptual metaphors used in Lawrence v. Texas to argue about sexual autonomy is a variant of the Critical Metaphor Analysis method practiced by Jonathan Charteris-Black.The textual analysis of Justice Kennedy&apos;s majority opinion and Justice Scalia&apos;s dissent reveals that &quot;liberty&quot; functions as the chief metaphor. Although the metaphor &quot;culture war&quot; is used explicitly by Justice Scalia only twice, and not at all used explicitly by Justice Kennedy, this metaphor as a descriptor of the nature of the argument of Lawrence v. Texas is indeed supported throughout the arguments by other related conceptual metaphors. Despite the absence of the &quot;culture war&quot; metaphor in Justice Kennedy&apos;s argument, the critical analysis of metaphor makes transparent the way he actually waged a very sophisticated rhetorical battle through metaphor in order to advance sexual autonomy. It also demonstrates that Justice Scalia&apos;s charge of the Court&apos;s engagement in &quot;culture war&quot; is not arbitrary, but supportable.This study demonstrates the theoretical and methodological synthesis possible in using Critical Metaphor Analysis on legal texts, and gives apple evidence of the impact cognitive metaphor theory has on advancing understanding of both how a text works and what a text means. Critical Metaphor Analysis facilitates a level of intellectual rigor, as it does not require adopting an a priori ideological stance. Instead the analysis is grounded in the cognitive workings of our shared human minds and bodily experiences as expressed in our use of conceptual metaphor.This work is a synthesizing demonstration of the need for critical rhetorical analysis of important judicial texts that will clarify the on-going role the courts are playing in the interpreting and shaping of our corporate life as a Nation.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Vocation as Politics: Work and Popular Theology in a Consumer Culture</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The idea of vocation or a calling is particularly salient in much business motivational literature and popular Christian self-help books alike.  Promoted is the idea of vocation that glosses over issues stemming from political power in the corporate workplace in order to given meaning to workers in spite of working conditions.  In this form, vocations are unable to engage one&apos;s working life in ways that they can and should.  I argue that recent trends in academic theologies of vocation as well as the role of consumer culture combine to allow the ascendancy of this form of the idea.  I support this claim with an analysis of the relationship between consumer culture and business.  I locate Rick Warren&apos;s concept of &quot;purpose&quot; contained in The Purpose-Driven Life as the functional equivalent of the idea of vocation that serves to distance the idea from the material workplace through its interplay with the mechanics of consumer culture.  Utilizing selective theological sources and José Casanova&apos;s work concerning public religions, I finally contend that the idea of vocation that resists wholesale commodification can express a latent political quality to combat particular unjust social norms that regulate the corporate work world.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>There has been little marital research that focuses on contributing factors to successful long-term marriage and even less focus on the role that love plays in long-term marriage.  As a means of furthering this research, the purpose of the current study was to examine levels of satisfaction in couples in long-term marriages and to identify contributing factors to an enduring marriage.  This study also examined the significance of love and changes in love after 35+ years of marriage.  Through the use of qualitativemethodology five couples who were self-identified as &quot;happy&quot; in their marriage and who had been married at least 35 years were interviewed.  Each couple was first interviewed together and then each spouse was interviewed separately.  As might have been expected, couples defined happiness in their marriage in ways that are similar to what they identified as being the &quot;key&quot; to their marriage.  Compromise, faith/religion, forgiveness, communication (ability to talk things through and resolve conflict), spending time together, and sharing common interests were common themes identified among the couples as being the &quot;key&quot; to their enduring marriage.  Other aspects of positive marital experience that were mentioned, but not as frequently, were sharing the same values, maintaining romance, being tenacious, being considerate of each other, showing appreciation, trust, and patience, limiting arguments/disagreements, and respecting one another.  Each spouse identified love as being an important aspect of their marriage and stated that it was why they stayed in their marriage. However, none of them identified love as being the &quot;key&quot; to their enduring marriage.  All of the spouses mentioned a change in love over the course of their marriage, whether it was the type of love, meaning of love, feeling of love, or development of love.  This study has implications for couples therapy and has contributed to research in love and happiness in long-term marriage and positive psychology.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&lt;bold&gt;Leadership&lt;/bold&gt; has been designated a talent area in federal and state definitions of &lt;bold&gt;gifted students&lt;/bold&gt; who require differentiated programs since the Marland Report came out in 1972, yet it remains the least discussed of the curricular areas for gifted students. The purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions and attitudes of administrators of gifted programs in Colorado and Idaho concerning identifying students gifted in leadership. Public K-12 school districts in Colorado and Idaho were surveyed using a researcher-created survey including questions targeting attitudes and twelve questions specific to leadership traits. Response rate was 51%. In general, respondents indicated it was possible to identify gifted student abilities in K-12 students and the two states agreed with each other in 89% of the leadership skills questioned. Colorado showed a philosophical preference in the nurture, or the developmental philosophy of leadership, over nature, or the inherent philosophy of the construct, whereas Idaho showed no preference. The results suggest that Leadership curriculum should be planned, implemented, and evaluated along a K -12 developmental continuum with multiple opportunities given for leadership development especially in programs for the gifted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Tory L. RicheyTitle: An Historical Inquiry into Thomas Jefferson&apos;s Influence on the American Educational SystemAdvisor: Dr. Elinor KatzDegree Date: August, 2009ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study was to take a deeper look at the influence of an important American historical figure, Thomas Jefferson, on the institution of the American Educational System. Thomas Jefferson was involved in many decisions involving the traditions, practices and institutions of many educational establishments of his time period. His writings have had a lasting influence on our society and the world. His words have been incorporated into many different countries&apos; constitutions across the world. It was important to study decisions of the past in order to understand how to make well-educated decisions in the future. Thomas Jefferson&apos;s ideas, his involvement in government, his personal morals and his involvement in writing documents have helped in founding our current educational system. Some examples of his beliefs about education were Universial Education, that education was tool used to keep tyranny at bay by having an informed citizenry and for providing for a system that allowed the intellectual elite to excel through a system of public education.  They are all major contributing factors to how he made decisions which influenced the American Educational System. Therefore it made a study of that influence relevant. Jefferson and his contemporaries had many thoughts and contributed many ideas towards the founding of our Early American Educational System. Jefferson had a wide base of ideas about various levels and aspects of education. Jefferson&apos;s diverse interests in different aspects of education had an influence on various facets of the American educational world. That interest therefore deserved a study to show Jefferson&apos;s influence, both positive and negative, on the founding of the American Educational System. The influence of the American thought process on the topic of education is a meaningful addition to the body of work on Jefferson.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Daniel E. ConnorsTitle: Analysis and Treatment of Emerging ContaminantsAdvisor: Keith E. MillerDegree Date: June 2009&lt;bold&gt;Abstract&lt;bold&gt;Two major classes of polar compounds have recently become a major focus as sources of contamination of water systems. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) enter water through wastewater streams, and many of these compounds survive current wastewater treatment processes. High production volume chemicals (HPVCs), defined as chemicals produced in excess of one million pounds per year have numerous entries into surface and drinking waters due to their ubiquity. The commonality between many of these compounds is their polarity, which makes them water-soluble.While both PPCPs and HPVCs have been entering into the environment for decades, advances in analyte detection have increased the ability of scientists to identify these compounds in surface, waste and drinking waters. Methods for polar compound suites have been developed using a number of technologies, however these processes are often time consuming and require specialized instrumentation.In this study, a fast, robust method for the detection and treatment of emerging polar contaminants was developed with accompanying instrumentation. A liquid chromatography system, hyphenated to a universal gas phase detector,  flame ionization detector (FID), was designed. By using pure subcritical water as a mobile phase, temperature was used to control chromatographic retention. This instrument may be used for rapid screening of environmental samples with minimal preparation. Using subcritical water chromatography allowed for testing of mass transfer between subcritical water and organic phases, which provides data on the transport of polar contaminants between solvent phases.A second component of the work in this dissertation was to test a treatment protocol for waste streams, which demonstrated the reduction of selected analytes within the PPCP and HPVC classes. Subcritical water wet oxidation allowed for the breakdown of all polar organic molecules dissolved in a water sample. As a thermochemical process, the oxidation reaction further reduced select compounds that remain after current biological waste removal processes, and provided a value-added process to current wastewater treatment, in which a needed process, disinfection, can be coupled to additional contaminant removal.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Robert Kennedy&apos;s announcement of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., in an Indianapolis urban community that did not revolt in riots on April 4, 1968, provides one significant example in which feelings, energy, and bodily risk resonate alongside the articulated message.  The relentless focus on Kennedy&apos;s spoken words, in historical biographies and other critical research, presents a problem of isolated effect because the power really comes from elements outside the speech act.  Thus, this project embraces the complexities of rhetorical effectivity, which involves such things as the unique situational context, all participants (both Kennedy and his audience) of the speech act, aesthetic argument, and the ethical implications.This version of the story embraces the many voices of the participants through first hand interviews and new oral history reports.  Using evidence provided from actual participants in the 1968 Indianapolis event, this project reflects critically upon the world disclosure of the event as it emerges from those remembrances.  Phenomenology provides one answer to the constitutive dilemma of rhetorical effectivity that stems from a lack of a framework that gets at questions of ethics, aesthetics, feelings, energy, etc.  Thus, this work takes a pedagogical shift away from discourse (verbal/written) as the primary place to render judgments about the effects of communication interaction.With a turn to explore extra-sensory reasoning, by way of the physical, emotional, and numinous, a multi-dimensional look at public address is delivered. The rhetorician will be interested in new ways of assessing effects. The communication ethicist will appreciate the work as concepts like answerability, emotional-volitional tone, and care for the other, come to life via application and consideration of Kennedy&apos;s appearance.  For argumentation scholars, the interest comes forth in a re-thinking of how we do argumentation.  And the critical cultural scholar will find this story ripe with opportunities to uncover the politics of representation, racialized discourse, privilege, power, ideological hegemony, and reconciliation.  Through an approach of multiple layers this real-life tale will expose the power of the presence among audience and speaker, emotive argument, as well as the magical turn of fate which all contributes the possibility of a dialogic rhetoric.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Michael J. McNealTitle: BECOMING GOOD EUROPEANS: GLOBALITY, THE EU AND THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE NIETZSCHE&apos;S IDEA OF EUROPEAdvisor: Jack DonnellyMarch 2009ABSTRACTThis dissertation takes up Friedrich Nietzsche&apos;s notion of `good Europeanism&apos; and his related idea of Europe to show how the former disposition may be cultivated to achieve the latter--a reinvigorated culture on the continent. It does so by applying his vitalist politics and power ontology (will to power hypothesis and theory of decadence) to critique European integration in the broader context of globalization. The analysis enables me to theorize how &quot;healthy&quot; individuals might exploit opportunities in the present to become &apos;good Europeans&apos;, with the aim of realizing Nietzsche&apos;s quasi-cosmopolitan idea of Europe. It is my primary contention that Nietzsche&apos;s diagnosis of Europe&apos;s ailment remains relevant, as does his strategy, via a radically Dionysian affirmation of life, for overcoming the international order it has spawned.In doing so I utilize Nietzsche&apos;s related perspectivalist epistemological stance and hermeneutical framework to build on Nietzsche&apos;s genealogy of morality. This shows the West&apos;s present &quot;slave moral&quot; regime to be a further intensified development of secularized Christian-Platonic values. It arose through the fusing of liberal-optimism (belief in equality, emancipation, enfranchisement, etc.) with modernity&apos;s doctrines of universalism, humanism, secularism, progressivism and rationalism. It also coextends with the positivistic orientation of scientism to transmit a secular faith in truth, and un-paradoxically an injurious relativism and cynical worldview. It is through Nietzsche&apos;s vitalist perspectivalism that I understand the psychological-historical origins and current operation of the axiomatic narratives promulgated via the meta-discourse of ultra-liberal-modernity.The same critical framework is applied to a doxagraphical survey of theories of European integration. These theories are understood as differing perspectives conceived within and informed by the same values matrix, and critiqued in chronological order of their appearance to reflect the evolution of the field. Problems of evaluation, indeterminacy and bias, and the form of reasoning privileged by the positivistic orientation conferred by scientism are examined in terms of how they inform the conduct of social science and conceptualizations and uses of fact. Acts of theorizing are understood as indicative of a will-to-truth which can positively augment life or negatively hamper it. I consider how the mainstream of the field has tended to reiterate the ideological presuppositions of ultra-liberal-modernity. Notable exceptions include recent constructivist approaches and discourse analysis critiques. These critical perspectives are productively broadening and potentially subverting the dominant conventions of the field. This raises the possibility that good Europeans may influence the future development of the EU as counter-theorizers of it.The EU is understood as a crucial locus of the globalization complex, a primarily reactive power constellation comprised of myriad institutions, processes and forces. A ressentiment-driven project, the globalization complex functions as an ideological juggernaut to universalize ultra-liberal-modern values. It affectively implements a negative will to nothingness as nihilistic power which culminates in a hyper-decadent condition typified by resignation to its prerogatives. Its values are politically instantiated throughout the world via democratization and hegemonic capital process.I examine the spectacularized existential meanings and simulated ontological purpose provided by the globalization complex. These engage and automatize the masses by means of commercially generated, media promoted desires and an ethos of consumerism. These sustain a philistinic culture of conformity by means of which its ideological proponents, ascetic-consumerist priests of ressentiment, justify and naturalize their authority. Their influence extends a spirit of revenge against life&apos;s radical contingency and temporality. It privileges homogenizing and ossifying modes of being to inhibit authentic becoming.However, the globalization complex cannot contain all the affective capacities its shrinking and simultaneous acceleration of the world generates. The increased interconnectivity between people that it facilitates and the reactive values matrix it imposes give rise to a changed mentality or consciousness. Life in within the globalization complex provides a few with a philosophical education that endows them with a broadened perspective on the differences between human types. They gain a profound appreciation of the need for the divergent worldviews that distinguish disparate cultures--forms of life imperiled by conventional globalization. This nurtures a reflective, historical consciousness and an acceptance of difference (entwined with their love of fate) that augments their emerging sense of globality and occasionally manifests itself in ways that escape capture. Among a few, globality fosters the skeptical-ironic disposition toward truth claims and craftiness characteristic of `good Europeans&apos;. Such iconoclastic individuals may creatively challenge the legitimacy of ultra-liberal-modern values, their distinctive striving symptomatic of a positive will to creative destruction as generative power and authentic becoming-other.To foster the development of the skeptical-ironic disposition of good Europeanism I suggest a six-fold skeptical praxis. This is based on the classical Pyrrhonean notions of akatalepsia (recognition of the impossibility of certain knowledge), epoche (the suspension of belief due to the contingency of truth), ataraxia (the ancient skeptic and stoic doctrine of disciplined withdrawal toward becoming what one is), apangelia (an avowal not involving a commitment to truth or falsity), adoxastos (the disciplined effort to avoid forming convictions and feigning agreement with prevailing value standards when necessary, which corresponds with the strategic use of masks), and finally, from the ancient cynics, the concept of parrhesia (fearless speech in mocking ascetic values). These practices support the perspectivalist stance toward truth that affirms the chaos of becoming. The adherents of such a discipline revel in contingency.According to Nietzsche&apos;s vision, I consider how `good Europeans&apos; might achieve their aims in light of the prevailing values of our globalizing world. Acting as comedians of ascetic ideals they engage in kynical acts that may utilize the new technologies and enhanced communications provided by science and industry (key components of the globalization complex), to lampoon the anti-human decadence and nihilism of our age. Their inherently political mockery of the prevailing social discourses arouses the passion of other healthy types. They are spurred to similarly creative experiments and life-affirming acts of defiance, and the ethos of `good Europeanism&apos; gradually spreads, thereby. Through their striving such `good Europeans&apos; (who, in our globalizing age, may appear in any geographical locale) become capable of recognizing and exploiting unanticipated, abstract potentials of globality.Afflicted with the decadence of our age, they are not the Übermenschen Nietzsche anticipated, but prevenient to them and more likely to be perceived as buffoons than as great leaders. They are neither conventional revolutionaries nor &quot;improvers of humankind&quot;; they endeavor to discredit the ultra-liberal-modern order instantiated through the globalization complex. By prompting it to reactively assert its prerogatives and intensify itself, they make its contradictoriness, antagonistic impetus and hostility to difference more apparent. However gradually, this will erode its legitimacy, as good Europeans exploit its vulnerabilities.According to Nietzsche&apos;s vision, I consider the ways in which `good Europeans&apos; would likely employ the democratic, egalitarian and populist sensibilities of the globalized masses, and how the EU approximates could be hijacked to augment their aim. They would also make use of human rights, artificial intelligence and bio-engineering to hasten our enervated epoch to its expiration.These efforts are conditioning the possibility for the appearance of Übermenschlich individuals to (nomothetically) legislate an agonistic socio-political milieu predicated on a natural rank order of types. It is the hope of `good Europeans&apos; that such Übermenschen will one day inaugurate a transhuman future and create a higher culture for the flourishing of greatness that secondarily edifies the multitude with the meaning and purpose great works provide.I conclude that if humankind succeeds in transfiguring itself through the going-down of our ultra-liberal-modern epoch (the most pervasive and decadent socio-political order in recorded history) these Übermenschen, the progeny of contemporary `good Europeans&apos;, will focus on the rehabilitation of the environment and preservation of the earth.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Although a number of approaches to the issue of religious violence are alreadyavailable for academic consumption, this study attempts to approach the problem of theviolent tension between religious principles and secular socio-political realities from anew perspective. We argue that religious violence is best conceptualized as a moment ofcrisis in the relationship between law and justice, considered as both intimately related (inKant&apos;s analysis of the rightful condition) and peculiarly disjointed (in Derrida&apos;sreflections on the possibility of &quot;justice beyond law&quot;). We provide a preliminary accountof the necessary conditions for a future theory of religious violence based on our effort torecontextualize the discussion of the corresponding issues by paying close theoreticalattention to the interaction between the concepts of law, justice, violence, and religion.We conclude that any theoretical reevaluation of religious violence must inevitably widenits scope to include not only such customary problems as the relationship between &quot;faith&quot;and &quot;knowledge&quot; or the relationship between &quot;private beliefs&quot; and &quot;public duties,&quot; butalso an account of the peculiarly religious motivational framework that often implicitlyguides our conversations about any future human condition of peace and justice.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study focuses on how state policies that encourage school reform impact student experience. The paper demonstrates what students in these reformed schools experience and what lessons we can learn from their experiences. In particular, the research focuses on engagement levels and the matching of intentions to student propensities.  A goal of the paper is to help bridge the policy and educational worlds by shedding light on what is happening in four school-of-choice classrooms.A mixed methodology is used; data from an Educational Connoisseurship and Criticism, an engagement measure, and interviews are triangulated. The research was conducted at two school-of-choice schools located in the Denver Metro area. The Expeditionary Learning school is a K-12 school and the Core Knowledge school is a K-8 school.The study found high levels of engagement and learning in schools of choice where propensities and interest are matched to the five dimensions of a classroom: pedagogy, curriculum, evaluation, structure, and intentions.Several themes emerged from the research. The first is that students and teachers at both schools had learning propensities and philosophies that were aligned with the intentions of the schools. This alignment helped create a strong community. The second theme is that interest is an important element of student learning and engagement. The third theme is that having a clear mission and intentions improves learning. Fourth, engagement is an important indicator of school success and high levels of engagement should continue to be a goal for schools to meet. I found that engagement is high in the two schools and reflected what was taking place in the classroom. The fifth and final theme is that students have different learning needs, and thus flexible state policies should allow for more variability to allow for a wider range of learning needs to be met.Data indicate that when the five elements of schooling match the students&apos; propensities, they are interested and engaged in the learning process. It is, therefore, important to create flexible state policies that allow more schools of choice to be created.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>AbstractTanya Marina MoteCarpas, Cuentos and Corridos: Chicano Arts and Community BuildingDr. John F. McCamant08/2009This study suggests that effective forms of participation are grounded in histories of opposition and resistance. The intermediate relationship provided by voluntary associations, unions, clubs and even bowling leagues might teach citizens to act democratically; that is, to participate in activities related to electing leaders, but their usefulness extends beyond conventional politics to efforts to expand public life and to promote democracy through a broader set of activities that combine intensely social and personal public engagement, resistance, protest, and opposition, with conventional efforts to influence leaders. The experiences of community based arts organizations provide a lens to examine both the barriers and opportunities that many organizations and their supporters face in their attempts to expand civil society. Community based arts organizations speak to issues that other institutions aren&apos;t addressing, preserve and perpetuate culture that is threatened and meet the needs of citizens who aren&apos;t being served well by dominant culture institutions.  The position of these organizations within their own communities and within the public sphere, places them in a unique position to raise issues and to enforce accountability among institutions and the larger public who often lack cultural competency.Political actors respond to political fragmentation by creating autonomous enclaves that cannot be easily classified and/or generalized. Although voluntary associations are seemingly conventional components of a conformist civic culture, they are versatile and multidimensional spaces that serve many needs for members, who experience meaningful face-to-face relationships, as well as an opportunity for dialogue and debate.  In small spaces, individuals have the opportunity to intentionally build community through practices of dialogue, mentoring, reciprocity, friendship and accountability.  In an environment where accountability is enforced it is easier to recognize and confront the contradictions that arise in every community.Ownership is derived from a shared investment and effort that is channeled into an enterprise, and it is an important component in participation. Movement building begins with simple efforts to engage individuals in a common struggle: it requires significant investment from individuals, and support from a community that reinforces the effort. New interpretations of movement building make it clear that autonomous enclaves have significant value to communities and provide important lessons in creating sustainability.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Chinese Democracy:How Elite Thinking on China&apos;s Development and Change Influences Chinese Practice of Democroacy (1839-- the Current Time)</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Will China become a multiparty democracy? This is the research problem of this dissertation. My hypothesis is this: the greater the extent that Chinese elite thinking on development and change reconciles the tension between Chinese nationalism and collectivist, family-like ethics on the one hand, and the western democratic ideals based on each self-seeking individual&apos;s subjectivity on the other hand, the greater the chance that China&apos;s political development will lead to a multiparty democracy. The dissertation includes two parts: Chapters two to five are historical analyses, and chapters six to eight are the interviews. It is my assumption that Chinese elite thinking on China&apos;s development and change has been influencing the Chinese practice of democracy since the Opium War (1839-1842), and will continue to have great impacts upon the Chinese pursuit of democracy in the next 20 years. I use chapters two to five of my dissertation, the historical analyses, to demonstrate the causal relationship between Chinese elite thinking on the development and change of Chinese society on the one hand, and Chinese historical practice of democracy (from 1839 till the current time, including &quot;Leninist democracy&quot;) on the other hand, the former being the independent variable and the latter being the dependent variable. The method used in chapters two to five is historiography, I develop my causal analysis based on extensive reading of historians&apos; and social scientists&apos; works. And then I use chapters six to eight of my dissertation , the interviews, as the most current information that reveals Chinese social trends toward the next 20 years, and make an assessment of whether, in the next 20 years (2004-2024), China will become a western style, multiparty democracy--and if the answer is yes, what that democracy will look like.For example, one could argue that such a democracy will be a combination of western democracy (based on the value of individualism) and Chinese culture (based on the value of collectivism). My judgment is based on chapters two to five, the historical analyses of the long-term trend, and chapters six to eight, the information gained from the interviewees. The method used in chapters six to eight is face to face, in-depth interviews. The interviewees come from the four elite groups in the current Chinese society: government officials, the enterprise people, media professionals, and intellectuals. The interview question does not directly ask question about democracy; rather, it asks the interviewee&apos;s personal opinions about &quot;the positive or negative factors that have been driving or limiting the development and change of X city (in the context of development and change of Chinese society since 1839), carrying it toward the next 20 years.&quot; So the interviewees do not directly talk about democracy--they just express their views on positive and negative factors that might influence the development and change that they are in. Because in urban development one can best experience the tension between traditional values and modern values, the development and change of a city (in the context of the development and change of Chinese society since 1839) and how people deal with it in their thinking should reveal information about the social trends.The major findings are these: 55.5 % of the interviewees are pro-democracy; 22.2 % of them are not pro-democracy; 16.6 % of them are not concerned about the issue of democracy in China; and 5.5 % of them are uncertain. I have found substantial evidence of favorable prospects for democracy. So my conclusion is: China has favorable prospects for becoming a multiparty democracy; any democratic system that emerges likely will be a Confucian democracy (communal or social democracy); the Chinese culture will become a combination of liberalism and Confucianism; the balance of traditional elements (Confucianism) and modern elements (liberalism) will depend on each individual&apos;s free will and free choice; the process of democratization will start with the intellectuals, and then spread to the whole nation. Finally, this democratization process will likely happen in the next 20 years (2004 to 2024), based on responses from the person I interviewed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Emma Kaye PennTitle: Common Strategies Used by Kindergarten Teachers to Instruct Reading to English-as-a-Second-Language StudentsAdvisor: Dr. Linda Lucille BrookhartDegree Date: August 2009AbstractThis research was designed to describe, analyze, and interpret what reading strategies experienced kindergarten teachers believe are essential to instruct English-as-a-Second-Language learners how to read. Through in-depth interviews, experienced kindergarten teachers were given a voice to describe what they consider essential reading strategies to instruct English-as-a-Second-Language learners to learn how to read.The participants were four licensed, non-probationary kindergarten teachers instructing reading in English to a minimum of 51% English-as-a-Second-Language population. Selected kindergarten programs were consistent in program design. Processes were influenced by the gateway approach. The stories teachers told about their experiences in teaching ELLs how to read was a means to connect with narrator experiences.The excerpted narratives for each participant required an understanding of the narrator&apos;s story in the context of their environment, their experience, and through the salient stories they shared. Patterns were discovered and shared in excerpted narratives and ultimately global themes were derived. Finally, this study has provided kindergarten teachers and administrators with practical knowledge regarding what is essential to instruct reading to English Language Learners in kindergarten.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Communicating Queer Identities through Personal Narrative and Intersectional Reflexivity</dc:title>

  <dc:description>There is currently a lack of intersubjective research involving human participants and conceptual frameworks that include queer theory. Queer theory&apos;s poststructuralist epistemology tends toward desubjectification, problematizing research that relies on participants&apos; self-reports of lived experience. The author proposes that the interdisciplinary nature of Communication Studies, which is situated within the humanities and social sciences, leaves communication scholars well poised to contribute to ongoing metatheoretical and metamethodological conversations regarding queer theory and intersubjective research, particularly in relation to cultures and identities. To contribute to this scholarly conversation, the author utilizes the deconstructionist lens of queer theory to contextualize communication, employs personal narrative as methodology informed by the performance paradigm, and co-constructs personal narratives with five queer-identified men in order to explore queer identity in lived experience. While queer theory&apos;s anti-essentialist philosophy has been explored and tested through textual analysis, queer scholars have rarely attempted to triangulate their assessment of the heuristic value of queer theory with the lived experiences of people who identify as queer. More specifically, the purpose of this dissertation is to explore how queer men experience their identities in relation to their bodies and personal politics, and how queer men contribute to and contest representations of gay male bodies in popular discourses and gay rights issues in political discourses. Additionally, the author operationalizes intersectional reflexivity as a paramethodological and political commitment throughout the research process. The following themes emerged from the narrative analysis: (1) queer men experience their identities in intersectional and reflexive ways, (2) queer men experience their bodies in relation to narrow and idealized representations of gay male bodies, and attempt to internalize and promote body positivity, (3) queer men espouse political commitments to social justice and coalitional activism that extend beyond legislative activism, (4) queerness in lived experience does not demonstrate the seamless anti-essentialist philosophy of queer theory in that queer men must negotiate ideological tensions grounded in daily practice, (5) experiences of incongruency within various identities leads queer men to develop a queer consciousness that is inherently intersectional and reflexive and creates spaces of possibility for coalitional activism. The narratives are presented using performative writing that captures the vocal and emotional qualities of the spoken words and creates dialogic spaces in which the voices and experiences of queer men become more public, validated, and supported across communities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Standardized assessment tools have been criticized for use with young children; however, there is limited empirical research supporting developmentally appropriate, play-based assessments. Forty children, with and without developmental disabilities, ages 10-73 months referred from the community of a large city received a transdisciplinary play based assessment (TPBA-2) and standardized assessment. Caretakers also completed the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior.  Concurrent validity between the TPBA-2 and standardized assessment tools (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning) was demonstrated (p &lt;. 01).  Ecological validity of the TPBA-2, or the ability of the assessment tool to capture every day functional skills, was also demonstrated (p &lt; .01).  No differences were found between the type of assessment and the facilitation of the child&apos;s typical skills observed in the home and community.  No differences were found between the type of assessment received and the child&apos;s behavior during the assessment.  This study provides empirical support of the TPBA-2 as a developmentally appropriate assessment tool in compliance with the standards of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA).</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Cortisol Reactivity Across the Day at Child Care: Examining the Contributions of Child Temperament and Attachment to Mother and Lead Teacher</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Previous work has shown that full-day center-based child care is associated with increased physiologic stress for many young children (e.g., Tout, de Haan, Campbell, &amp; Gunnar, 1998; Watamura, Sebanc, &amp; Gunnar, 2002). Specifically, increasing cortisol from morning to afternoon at full-day child care in contrast to decreasing cortisol across the day for these same children at home has been repeatedly demonstrated for toddlers and preschoolers. Factors that have been related to rising cortisol across the day at child care include the child&apos;s age (rising cortisol at child care between 2 and 5 years, but not for infants or older children, Dettling, Parker, Lane, Sebanc, &amp; Gunnar, 2000; Watamura, Donzella, Alwin, &amp; Gunnar, 2003), and global classroom quality (higher quality classrooms having fewer children showing rising cortisol across the day, e.g., Sims, Guilfoyle, &amp; Parry, 2006). Some studies have also identified relations with particular temperaments (e.g., Watamura, et al., 2002). Furthermore, recent work suggests that rising cortisol at child care may be associated with health risk in the form of lower antibody levels (Watamura, Coe, Laudenslager, &amp; Robertson, 2009) and that early child care may be associated with attenuated cortisol in adolescence (Roisman, et al., 2009).This study extended the previous work on stress reactivity at child care by addressing: 1) whether children&apos;s attachment to their primary caregiver was associated with how they respond to the challenge of child care; 2) whether negative child temperament alone or in combination with insecure attachment was associated with how they respond to the challenge of child care; and 3) whether the nature of children&apos;s attachment to their teacher explained how they respond to the challenge of child care. Saliva samples were collected on three child care days at mid-morning and mid-afternoon. Temperament was assessed by both parents (CBQ; Putnam &amp; Rothbart, 2006) and teachers (T-CBQ; Gunnar, Tout, de Haan, Pierce, S., &amp; Stanbury, 1997) and attachment security was measured using the AQS (Waters, 1995) with the primary caregiver and lead teacher.Children rated as high in both security and dependency to their primary caregiver were more likely than secure children with low dependency or insecure children to show rising cortisol across the day at child care. In addition, children who scored lower on the teacher sorted AQS sociability factor (but not on the CBQ or T-CBQ temperament factors) were more likely to show rising cortisol across the day at child care. Finally, higher security with teachers was associated with falling cortisol across the day at child care. These results suggest that in the process of acquiring a solidified working model of secure attachment to primary caregivers, children who are secure but still dependent may be more stress reactive to out-of-home care. Furthermore, as these results demonstrate that secure relationships with teachers may buffer children from flat or rising cortisol at child care, they suggest a concrete avenue for intervention.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the cultural identity and cultural connectedness of multiple generations of American Indians whose families had been living continuously in an urban area for 40 to 50 years. The intent of the current study was to better understand how members of this group developed and maintained their cultural identities while living away from a tribal community and as a small percentage of the population of a large and culturally diverse metropolitan area. The study also sought to identify what constituted cultural connectedness--a term used frequently amongst urban Indians that appears to encompass factors of importance to being American Indian. Three or four generations of members from five families were interviewed to explore not only the development and maintenance of cultural identity and connectedness, but of equal importance, how these phenomena may be evolving over the course of multiple generations and are impacted by urban living. A phenomenological approach was utilized to capture the lived experiences of study participants, and interviews were analyzed using Giorgi&apos;s methodology for the phenomenological reduction of qualitative data. Findings revealed meaning structures (what constituted the phenomena) and styles (how the phenomena were exhibited) of cultural identity and cultural connectedness, including the cognitive, affective, and behavioral constituents of each of these phenomena. Implications for social work research, education, and practice were discussed. The new knowledge generated by this study may help agencies and those working with urban Indians to design and provide services that are more culturally relevant, as well as assist practitioners in their efforts to be better informed and skilled at working with this population.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Kindergarten has been a part of the educational landscape of the United States since 1856, when the first kindergarten opened in Watertown, Wisconsin. If we fast-forward more than a century and a half to the present, it is clear that the landscape composition of the garden-ideologically, culturally, socially, and politically for children&apos;s play has drastically changed. The purpose of this study,(De)Composing a Garden for Children&apos;s Play, is to examine kindergartners&apos; play set against changing school polices and practices of recent years in one Colorado school district. Four research questions guided this inquiry: 1. What does kindergarten look like in this school district? 2. What is the current state of play inthe kindergarten classroom? 3. Are teachers establishing practices responsive to the cognitive, social and emotional well-being of kindergartners, while at the same time adhering to the requirements of the district and/or state and federal government? 4. How do contemporary kindergartners themselves reflect upon or view the kinds (amounts) of play which they engage in within the school day? Elliot Eisner&apos;s model of Educational Connoisseurship and Criticism was the qualitative method utilized throughout this study. Data was collected over seven months during the 2008-09 academic year. Fredrich Froebel&apos;s ideal, of kindergarten as a garden for children&apos;s play, has changed over time due to myriad reasons. One is the entire transfer of kindergarten from a private entity to the K-12 public education arena since World War II. Another change in kindergarten education can be traced to changes in educational policy in the &quot;age of accountability.&quot; As a result, more curriculum is presented to students at a younger age. The urge to &quot;get it covered&quot; was felt by each of the teachers in this study, in that they all alluded to the pressures of curricular coverage. It is little surpised that more time was dedicated to &quot;work&quot; and less time was devoted to free &quot;play.&quot; Further reserach possibilities include: exploration of preschool settings in the age of accountability as well as a closer look into pre-service and in-service education on the value of play for educators.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Tanachit KasintornTitle: Development of Test of Academic ReadinessAdvisor: Professor Kathy E. GreenDegree Date: June 2009ABSTRACTThe purpose of this study was to develop a test of academic readiness for first grade instruction in Thailand.  Test of Academic Readiness (TAR) consists of six domains: verbal, visual, memory, math, logical, and general knowledge.  Two pilot studies were carried out and a main study tested items in those domains.  Rasch model was used to assess the scale&apos;s level of reliability and item discrimination.  Content validity was claimed through extensive review of literature and similar readiness tests both in the U.S. and Thailand.TAR achieved a range of reliability between 0.73-0.93 with the exception of the visual subtest, with a reliability of 0.43.  With the exception of the visual subtest, TAR has sufficient reliability to be worthwhile for future research to improve TAR as a measure of academic readiness for first grade instruction in Thailand. Further validation studies are recommended.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Disruptive Technologies In Systems Of Care:  An Exploratory Study of Social Work With Older Adults In Long-Term Care Facilities</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this exploratory research was to explore the application of knowledge about disruptive technologies to the long term care setting using the Eden Alternative&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; as an example. The research questions were:  What themes of structuration emerge when a long-term care facility implements a disruptive social technology? What is the nature of the disruption between and among workers, long-term care facility culture, and professionals when a new social technology is introduced? How does social work practice with older adults change when a social technology such as Eden is introduced in a long-term care setting? Is Barley&apos;s (1984, 1986) model of analysis useful to predict each facility&apos;s stage of implementation at a given time? Can the Barley (1984, 1986) model help explain why the same social technology impacts different facilities in distinct and different ways? Can the Barley (1984, 1986) model predict how far along a facility is in implementing the technology? Can Black, Carlile and Repenning&apos;s (2004) model of analysis help predict the relationship between activities, expertise and accumulations in a facility implementing the Eden Alternative&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;?The literature on culture and structuration was used in this exploration to highlight the internal struggle of culture to resist or relent to change and how structures would reform in the new culture.  In doing so the researcher sought to replicate the successful study conducted by Barley (1984) which investigated the introduction of CAT scan technology in the radiology departments at two different hospitals.  Barley (1984) hypothesized that it was not the CAT scan technology that lead to different outcomes in each department of radiology, but the social interaction with the technology.  Later, a study by Black et al (2004) further examined the changes in occupational role that might emerge by simulating changes using a recursive model based on Barley&apos;s work.  This study applies Black&apos;s extension of Barley&apos;s model to speculate about the emerging role of the social worker in long term care facilities that are exposed to disruptive technologies, assuming that the long term care industry will be radically altered in the next ten years in the direction of social technologies such as the Eden Alternative and under the weight of a rapidly increasingly population of older Americans. For the current study Eden Alternative&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; was implemented in two long-term care facilities at approximately the same time and the researcher conducted observations to see how the two organizational cultures responded to the changes that were made and look at the differences in implementation. In the end this research has discovered that the social technology of the Eden Alternative&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; did indeed behave as a soft technology disrupting the existing culture of both settings into which it was introduced during the observation period.  The results, explore the manner in which the behaviors in relationship to the technology are similar to and different from previous research findings.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the characteristics of nine teachers considered effective by their school administrators.  Qualitative methodology was used to examine characteristics of effective teachers in three Colorado public high schools.  Data was collected through observations and interviews and examined through the lens of Elliot Eisner&apos;s educational criticism and connoisseurship. Through in-depth interviews, these effective teachers identified and interpreted experiences that have contributed to them being considered  &quot;effective&quot;  teachers:  Personal Experiences, Motivational Techniques, Obstacles They Overcame, and Skills They Now Posesss as &quot;Effective Teachers&quot;.  Conclusions were as follows:  The common characteristics the teachers shared were preparedness, caring, collaboration, and reflection.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Effectiveness of Teacher Preparation Programs as Perceived by First Year Teachers</dc:title>

  <dc:description>High rates of teacher attrition, particularly among those within their first years of teaching, have prompted studies aimed at identifying issues and recommendations for analyzing and improving teacher preparation programs. This study used a mixed methodology to investigate effectiveness of teacher preparation programs as perceived by first year teachers. Preliminary focus groups were formed to promote conversation and identify perceived strengths and weaknesses of preparation programs. Feedback from the focus groups combined with topics from extant literature resulted in a survey instrument that was administered to novice teachers as they completed their preparation/certification programs and began their first year of teaching. Likert scale questions and open-ended responses were included in the study instrument.The participants in the study consisted of 147 novice teachers who responded to the survey questionnaire. Participants represented graduates from traditional and non-traditional teacher preparation programs; including public university-based, private university-based, teacher-in-residence, and alternative licensure programs.Results indicate that gender constituted a significant variable in all tests conducted. Ethnicity and the level of participants&apos; education did not have significant relationships to survey results in correlational analyses, but did have statistically significant levels in ANOVA tests. Integral to the ethnicity analyses, however, are the comparative numbers of respondents. Correlational analysis testing the number of hours of classroom experience novice teachers had compiled relative to survey item analyses showed a significant relationship between these variables, indicating that the more time respondents had worked in classrooms, the higher their perceived levels of program effectiveness. In all tests, level of household income did not show a statistically significant relationship to survey response analyses.Further analyses from this study indicate that, although there are components or foci of teacher preparation programs that are perceived by many study participants as being strong, there are also areas needing alignment and emphasis. Some of these areas include the ability to deal with work-related stress; differentiation of instruction based on students&apos; ability, economic, linguistic or cultural diversity; classroom management effectiveness; and ability to teach required content with confidence and effectiveness.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The intent of the study was to understand the changes that have occurred over the last 25 years in library programs as far as enrollment and diversity of students, number and ethnicity of the faculty, program income and expenses, cost of attendance, and scholarship and fellowship aid, in an effort to better understand library programs granting the MLIS degree.  The study also endeavored to identify institutional factors associated with the retention and productivity rates of White students and students of color in schools of library and information science.  During the period studied, the proportional representation of White students decreased.  For students of color, proportional representation was stable during the same time period.  Results revealed a medium effect size of time with productivity rates for both groups declining over time.  Retention rate differed significantly by time, with a small effect size with retention rate that initially increased over time, but is now decreasing. The final analyses were meta-regressions to determine if retention and productivity rates can be predicted by cost of attendance, scholarship and fellow aid, and program size.  Results indicated that for students of color, program size in 2000 was significantly predictive of retention, cost of attendance was predictive in 2002, and scholarship and fellowship aid was predictive of retention in 2004.  No variables were significantly predictive for retention of White students.   The last analysis was to determine if productivity rate can be predicted by cost of attendance, scholarship and fellow aid, and program size.  Results indicate that for White students in 2002, the cost of attendance was predictive of productivity rating.  In 2003, scholarship and fellowship aid was predictive of productivity rate and in 2004, scholarship and fellowship aid was predictive of productivity rating.   For students of color, results indicate that only scholarship and fellowship aid in 2005 was predictive of productivity rate.  No other variables in any of the years studied showed any significant prediction of productivity rating for students of color.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>An important aspect of developing science literacy for all students is developing science-literate teachers. With the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, many middle school teachers found themselves in a position where they were no longer qualified to teach middle school science.  This study was designed to help science teachers increase their science content knowledge, identify and resolve misconceptions/errors they may have, and assist them in their teaching by providing strategies for inquiry-based teaching, science laboratory exercises, and science equipment.Teachers enrolled in biology courses offered by the Rocky Mountain Middle School Math and Science Partnership participated in this study.  They were required to take pre-, post-, and follow-up assessments over course concepts, complete a survey over their background and teaching pedagogy, and be observed teaching in their classrooms for three class periods followed by an interview after each observation.The results included key findings:1)  These assessments indicated that science teachers can increase their science content knowledge by attending high-quality professional development courses designed to help increase basic science content knowledge on science content.2)  Teachers held numerous misconceptions as shown by the assessments and classroom observations.  Some were resolved, some that appeared to be resolved at the time of the post test reappeared again on the follow-up test, and some were not resolved.3)  Teacher observations showed that they did use science equipment provided by the course instructors and they taught the content from the Biology course where appropriate.  Teachers teaching classes other than biology demonstrated their ability to teach inquiry science by employing inquiry activities and teaching with a &quot;scientific method&quot; approach.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Public school classrooms in the United States are composed of an increasingly diverse population of learners.  The number of students with limited proficiency in English has grown exponentially across the United States, yet their level of academic achievement lags significantly behind that of their language-majority peers.The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes, opinions and practices of middle school language arts/reading teachers regarding the inclusion of ELL students and the support they receive in their classrooms.  The researcher administered a survey to 171 language arts/reading middle school teachers and interviewed six teachers from fourteen schools in a school district in the Southwest United States.Respondents welcomed the cultural diversity that ELL students bring to the classroom, but encouraged linguistic assimilation as a condition of student success.  A significant percentage of teachers indicated some ELL training but felt inadequately prepared to the challenges of teaching ELL students.  Native language resources and instructional materials were limited and not used.  Teachers were willing to give students more time to complete their coursework, but not necessarily lessen the amount of student work.Based on these findings and their relationship to the literature of the field, the author recommended that further research be conducted regarding the relationship between teachers&apos; language attitude and student outcomes, and geographical areas and grade levels.  Additional recommendations were made regarding specialized certification for teachers of ELL students, professional development programs, educational policy and state legislative action.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>While schools are experiencing unparalleled racial, linguistic, and ethnic diversity, gifted programs do not reflect these changing demographics. In fact, African-American students are less than half as likely to be in gifted classes and programs than are their European-American counterparts. In addition, little is known about the impact of gifted programs on students.This qualitative study incorporated oral history interviews to examine the experiences of four gifted African-American students who attended full time programs or schools designed for gifted students. In telling their stories through narratives, participants constructed past events with a focus on the personal meanings ascribed to their experiences. Thus, the impact of gifted programming is revealed through both benefits and costs, and implications for educational stakeholders surfaced.Blending oral history with educational criticism and connoisseurship provided a framework with which to describe, interpret, and evaluate the educational events and settings of these gifted students. Recurring themes - adversity, resilience, and acceptance - emerged from the analysis of the data and defined the educational experiences of these gifted African-American students. Insights from each participant were combined with essential features that emerged from the interpretation and evaluation of their stories. Implications focused on issues of advocacy, awareness and acknowledgement, and support. Resulting recommendations hold significance for those who work with and advocate for gifted African-American students and/or for those who make policies that guide gifted programming.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine three means of universal screening to identify students in need of reading interventions at the secondary school level. Specifically the results of the Colorado State Assessment Program (CSAP), the Test of Silent Contextual Reading Fluency (TOSCRF) (Hammill, Wiederholt, &amp; Allen, 2006) and the Test of Silent Word Reading Fluency (TOSWRF) (Mather, Hammill, Allen, &amp; Roberts, 2004) were used to group students in a Response to Intervention Framework of Tier 1 (needing no intervention), Tier 2 (needing intervention) and Tier 3 (needing intensive intervention).  Categorization results were compared to determine the accuracy of identification by these screening tools.  Analysis of the results indicated a significant difference between the CSAP and each of the other screening tools. Use of state assessment results alone resulted in under identification of students in need of interventions as compared to use of the TOSCRF or TOSWRF. No significant differences by gender across the three tests were seen. A significant difference was seen between the performance of Hispanic students and White students; this, however, could be attributed to the sample size.  In addition, no significant interaction effects of gender by Hispanic/White ethnicity were noted for each of the three tests. Finally, no significance was seen within each screening tool by grade; there was, however, significance across the three screening tools by grade. Implications for practice, as well as future research, are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The natural knee is one of the most commonly injured joints in the body due to relatively high loads and motions that can lead to debilitating degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis.  Total knee arthroplasty is a clinically successful method for eliminating pain in the osteoarthritic knee, but is subject to complications that can affect patient satisfaction and long-term implant performance.  The work presented in this dissertation is a demonstration of how anatomic three-dimensional (3D) computational knee models can be an effective alternative for investigating knee mechanics when compared to the cost and time prohibitive nature of in-vivo and in-vitro methods.  The studies described in this work utilized the explicit finite element (FE) method to investigate varying aspects of soft tissue constraint, implant alignment, and applied dynamic loading on knee mechanics in 3D natural and implanted partial or whole joint knee models.Combined probabilistic and FE methods were used to successfully identify the most important parameters affecting joint laxity in the natural knee and patellar component alignment in the implanted knee.  Two model verification studies demonstrated strong agreement between model-predicted and experimental 3D kinematics of specimen-specific isolated patellofemoral and whole joint cadaveric knee models under simulated dynamic loading (deep knee bend and gait) collected in a mechanical simulator.  Using one of the single specimen whole joint models, an additional study successfully identified the most important anatomic and implant alignment parameters related to a clinically-relevant complication associated with a particular implant design.  Lastly, a new method of efficiently generating 3D natural articular knee surfaces for FE analysis was developed through a combined mesh morphing and statistical shape modeling approach.  These studies included several novel methods for investigating knee mechanics under dynamic loading and specimen-specific soft tissue constraint using the explicit FE method that could be used to better reproduce the complex in-vivo knee environment in forward or muscle-driven models and to assist design-phase implant performance evaluation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The United States is focusing on the important and worthy goal of no child being left behind and in order to accomplish this goal, we must ensure that no teacher, including the first-year teacher, is left behind. This study explores the experiences of three first-year teachers on a monthly basis and uncovers the successes, challenges, supports, and needs that they encounter.Five research questions guided this study: 1. What are the experiences of a group of first-year teachers and in what ways were these experiences challenging, supportive, or detrimental? 2. What are the benefits for the first-year teachers in meeting monthly with other first-year teachers in a non-evaluative seminar setting to reflect upon and describe their experiences? 3. What is the value in using a descriptive feedback process (Rodger&apos;s 2006) in focus group discussions with first-year teachers and what effect does the process have on the reflective practices of the first-year teachers? 4. What effect does the process of creating visual have on the first year teacher&apos;s ability to reflect upon and express their experiences in meaningful ways? 5. What are the implications of this study for teacher education programs, schools, districts, and induction and mentoring programs? Focus group discussions, ethno-mimesis, a/r/tography, and performance ethnography are used to explore the first-year teachers experiences.Findings from the study demonstrated that the first-year teachers endured a significant transition from student teaching to teaching and encountered unexpected situations over which they had minimal control. They faced challenges with student behaviors and stressful events such as classroom parties. They encountered varying levels of support from teammates, colleagues, principals, and parents. This study&apos;s monthly seminar meetings in a non-evaluative setting were beneficial to the first-year teachers and provided them with the opportunity to focus on the development of reflective practice. This study also demonstrated that a descriptive feedback process (Rodger&apos;s 2006) was detrimental rather than beneficial in conducting focus groups, but proved useful during data analysis.

  <dc:description>Exploring the views of rural high school students about college has significant implications for the question: &quot;Why are Colorado&apos;s kids not choosing college in greater numbers?&quot; Since the State of Colorado has one of the most highly educated adult populations in the nation, yet consistently underperforms in sending its high school students to college this dissertation is topical in presenting the opinions and perceptions of 1,012 rural high school students.By including the voices of rural Colorado students through a survey, by investigating what the students are thinking and feeling about their future, and by learning what their level of awareness is regarding options and choices, this study contributes to a wider body of knowledge about how rural high school students access the information that makes college choice possible. The survey which is at the heart of this dissertation was designed to examine the students&apos; possession of college-going assets, such as knowledge about standardized tests, access to college materials, articulation of options, expectations, and awareness of college costs and financing.One of the major findings in the Exploring Rural Views study was the difference between students who had been continuously exposed to college counseling and those who had not. There are statistically significant differences in the group&apos;s identification of their assets. The survey results pointed out that these two groups act differently; the college counseled group had more agreement, and more assets.Other findings included: information about college is not reaching everyone who needs to be reached--approximately 11,000 kids on the Western Slope alone are identified as the &quot;paradox group,&quot; and more needs to be done to understand why these kids do not go to college, to capture their voices and better measure their understanding of the college attainment process.College fairs, college representative visits, the internet, virtual tours, college view books, college visits, parent and teacher expectations as well as information distribution are all necessary components of the college access continuum. These necessary components are not enough unless they are in concert as an established part of a college access culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Across the United States, school districts are working to turnaround their lowest performing schools in order to meet the requirements of Adequate Yearly Progress mandated by the &lt;italics&gt;No Child Left Behind Act&lt;/italics&gt; of 2001. These failing schools are facing district, state, and federal sanctions of closure, takeover, or restructuring. A new phenomenon emerging from this dire state in education is the turnaround leader. An educational turnaround leader is one who leads a high poverty, low performing school to dramatic improvement. Limited research exists on educational turnaround leaders, but what is available hypothesizes that turnaround leaders have different characteristics and qualities.The purpose of this study was to explore the phenomenon of turnaround school leadership and to identify the essential attributes of a turnaround leader. Turnaround principals were identified across the state of Colorado based on their School Accountability rating improvements over a two to five year period. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and data analyzed using the classic grounded theory methodology of coding, memoing, theoretical sampling, and constant comparative analysis.The study generated a set of conceptual hypotheses and an integrated theoretical model that explains the behavior of the turnaround principals as they worked to solve their main problem of improving the lives of the disadvantaged students in their schools through academic achievement. The theoretical model represents the essential attributes of the turnaround principals consisting of intellectual attributes and emotional attributes held in a dynamic state by two balancing attributes. The attribute of moral leadership emerged as the core category at the center of the model and was the prime mover of the behavior of the turnaround principals. Turnaround principals are moral leaders who infuse moral leadership in their thinking, decisions, and actions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Numerous freshman transition programs are conducted throughout the nation to address the middle school to high school transition issue. The current study focuses on a high school transition model, the Freshman Academy, to improve ninth-grade attendance, academic achievement, and school engagement for at-risk students. School engagement encompasses three interrelated components: emotion, behavior, and cognition.The current study used a quasi-experimental pre- and posttest comparison design with no random assignment to measure the impact of the Freshman Academy on attendance, academic achievement, and school engagement. Student interviews were conducted to see what aspects of the Freshman Academy promote school engagement and what improvements could be made to the Freshman Academy program. The target population was the ninth-grade students who had been identified as at risk at a high school outside Denver, Colorado. The research was conducted using their Freshman Academy students and a comparison group.An independent t-test was used to test for differences in the three areas of school engagement for the Freshman Academy and comparison group. A paired sample t-test was used to compare the eighth-grade and ninth-grade unexcused absences and GPA. The results from the Student Survey on School Engagement showed that for behavioral engagement the comparison group had higher levels of engagement at the end than the Freshman Academy. For cognitive and emotional engagement there were no differences. Pre- and post-GPAs for the Freshman Academy showed no change. For unexcused absences, the averages were significantly different from eighth to ninth grade. Truancies, measured by unexcused absences, were reduced by two-thirds.Qualitative findings were quite different from those results from the school engagement survey, attendance data, and GPA data. From the student interviews, the students commonly reported that the Freshman Academy was like a family. The respondents felt like the teachers cared about them, showed the relevance of what they were teaching, and used a variety of instructional strategies to maintain the interest of their students. According to the students, the improvements that could be made to the Freshman Academy program included aspects of the environment, teacher-student relationship, and curriculum and instruction.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study places the stories of Mexican American Methodist women in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands within the context of the organizational history of the United Methodist Women of the Rio Grande Conference of the United Methodist Church: Mujeres Metodistas Unidas, or the MMU. It focuses on the experiences and memories of women who came into contact with the ideals imported by Anglo Methodist missionaries to the U.S. southwest immediately following the conquest of the northern half of Mexico in 1848.In order to understand the experiences of Mexican American women in relation to the history of Methodism in the southwest, this study explores the most salient and relevant themes found in Methodist missionary activity beginning in 1869 and continuing through 2008. The origins of the Methodist missionary work with Mexican women lie in the Women&apos;s Foreign Mission Society founded in 1869 by a group of Anglo women in Boston, Mass.By placing the missionary documents into conversation with Mexican women&apos;s voices, memories and experiences, this study shows the ways in which Mexican American women adapted to, resisted and reshaped Methodism to suit their educational, social and religious needs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The overall goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the multifactorial etiology of  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by testing a diathesis-stress model of gene x environment (g x e) interactions.  Although the literature increasingly supports g x e interactions in the manifestation of ADHD, few studies have investigated multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, included direct tests of gene - environment correlations (rG-Es), explored the specificity of interactions to symptom dimensions, or attempted to minimize comparisons.     Therefore, utilizing both within-family (FBAT/PBAT) and case-control methodology, this study sought to (1)  explore main effects of polymorphisms in the DRD2, DRD4, DRD5,  DAT1, 5HTT, ADRA2C and DBH genes on ADHD symptoms in a community sample, (2) explore main effects of environmental risk factors on ADHD symptoms (including direct tests of gene - environment correlation), (3) test for g x e interaction effects between those environmental and genetic risk factors substantiated by main effects, and (4) investigate whether results were specific to particular symptom dimensions of ADHD.   Analyses demonstrated a robust main effect of the DRD4 4-repeat allele (DRD4*4R) on ADHD symptoms rather than the DRD4 7-repeat allele (DRD4*7R), that had previously been implicated in ADHD. Analyses also revealed main effects of maternal smoking, prenatal alcohol exposure, season of birth, parental education, and television viewing habits on ADHD symptoms.  After considering rG-Es, results demonstrated significant diathesis-stress g x e interactions between DRD4*4R and season of birth, maternal smoking, and parental education that selectively exacerbated hyperactive-impulsive (HI) symptoms.  Exploratory analyses demonstrated a main effect of the DAT1 10-repeat allele (DAT1*10R) on ADHD-Combined Type and HI symptoms, and revealed significant interactions between DAT1*10R and parental education and season of birth on HI behaviors.  Taken together, these data are consistent with a diathesis-stress model for g x e interactions in ADHD, suggest a possible alternate risk factor in linkage disequilibrium with DRD4*4R and DRD4*7R that may be the true &quot;risk&quot; allele, provide evidence that DAT1*10R may play into a subtype-specific etiology for ADHD-C, and support the idea that polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes interact with parental education and season of birth to selectively exacerbate HI symptoms.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The goal of this project was to advance understanding of the complex multifactorial etiology of developmental dyslexia, or reading disability (RD), by investigating gene x environment (G x E) interactions.  This project tested for G x E interactions using molecular genetic methods and measures of psychosocial and bioenvironmental risk factors.  There are two competing predictions that can be derived from existing G x E models about the expected direction of interactions in RD.  There could be &quot;diathesis-stress&quot; interactions in which the effects of genotype are stronger in risk environments, or there could be &quot;bioecological&quot; interactions in which the effects of genotype are stronger in optimal environments.  This study was a sib-pair linkage design including dizygotic twins and their non-twin siblings (age 8-19 years) from 212 families.  Analyses initially focused on identifying genetic and environmental risk factors showing main effects on reading phenotypes.  Sib-pair linkage analyses with two regression-based linkage models (DeFries-Fulker and Haseman-Elston) showed converging evidence for linkage in 4 regions previously associated with RD, 1p36-p34, 3p12-q13, 6p22.2, and 15q21.  Across chromosomal locations, the phenotype with the strongest evidence for linkage was rapid naming.  In the environmental analyses, three home variables (parental education, books in the home, and child print exposure) and two bioenvironmental variables (prenatal exposure to smoking and birth weight) showed statistically independent main effects on child reading.  The G x E analyses were conducted at the significant linkage peaks with the environments showing main effects.  Both DeFries-Fulker and Haseman-Elston G x E analyses showed converging evidence for diathesis-stress G x E interaction with parent education at the chromosome 1 and 3 loci for phonological phenotypes.  Follow-up analyses controlling for scaling artifacts, G-E correlations, and ADHD comorbidity revealed that the diathesis-stress G x E interactions were generally robust to these confounding factors.  Discussion of the results focused on exploration of the diathesis-stress interactions in the context of previous behavioral genetic and molecular genetic findings, including dimensions that may be important for directionality of interactions, such as genetic approach (behavioral versus molecular), sample characteristics (age, disorder, and comorbidity), and environmental range.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>It has become common for researchers and international development institutions to recommend the use of derivative instruments to developing country farmers and policymakers as a means of insuring agricultural incomes against the threats posed by volatile global commodity prices.  Despite such enthusiasm, very little research to date examines whether or not derivative instruments actually can deliver income support to agricultural producers who face commodity price risk.  This dissertation evaluates these recommendations, focusing upon the potential income security benefits of hedging with futures instruments for coffee farmers in Mexico, Brazil and Uganda during the 1998-2002 coffee crisis.  The three-part quantitative and qualitative analysis undertaken focuses upon: 1. The ability of futures hedging to address the income insecurity of coffee producers (with income security having four dimensions: certainty, stability, adequacy and (in)equality); 2. Difficulties accessing futures markets, especially among small producers, due to various obstacles such size, yield risk, cost, information and knowledge; and, 3. Policy innovations and alternatives that could enhance the services provided by futures markets, supplement, or replace them in the coffee context.  The data suggest that futures hedging provides an ambiguous income security service that in some cases can improve farmer income security, while in other cases making farmer incomes more insecure.  Further, no hedging strategy tested was able to address all four aspects of farmer income (in)security simultaneously, suggesting the need for policymakers to consider alternative commodity price risk management arrangements.  The data additionally suggest that substantial portions of the coffee farming populations of the three case countries are systematically excluded from futures hedging due to the presence of severe obstacles to substantive participation.  Alarmingly, many of the futures market intermediaries erected by development institutions and/or national policymakers in the three case countries also fail to include small coffee producers, and sometimes provide risk management services of dubious quality.  The dissertation concludes with suggestions for cautious and limited application of futures instruments by governments to the problem of coffee farmer income insecurity, as well as suggestions about alternative arrangements that may be of greater income security assistance to small coffee producers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>One of the greatest challenges facing network operators today is the identification of malicious activity on their networks.  The current approach is to deploy a set of intrusion detection sensors (IDSs) in various locations throughout the network and on strategic hosts.  Unfortunately, the available intrusion detection technologies generate an overwhelming volume of false alarms, making the task of identifying genuine attacks nearly impossible. This problem is very difficult to solve even in networks of nominal size. The task of uncovering attacks in enterprise class networks quickly becomes unmanageable.Research on improving intrusion detection sensors is ongoing, but given the nature of the problem to be solved, progress is slow.  Research simultaneously continues in the field of mining the set of alarms produced by IDS sensors.  Varying techniques have been proposed to aggregate, correlate, and classify the alarms in ways that make the end result more concise and digestible for human analysis.  To date, the majority of these techniques have been successful only in networks of modest size. As a means of extending this research to real world, enterprise scale networks, we propose 5 heuristics supporting a three-pronged approach to the systematic evaluation of large intrusion detection logs.  Primarily, we provide a set of algorithms to assist operations personnel in the daunting task of ensuring that no true attack goes unnoticed. Secondly, we provide information that can be used to tune the sensors which are deployed on the network, reducing the overall alarm volume, thus mitigating the monitoring costs both in terms of hardware and labor, and improving overall accuracy.  Third, we provide a means of discovering stages of attacks that were overlooked by the analyst, based on logs of known security incidents.Our techniques work by applying a combination of graph algorithms and Markovian stochastic processes to perform probabilistic analysis as to whether an alarm is a true or false positive. Using these techniques it is possible to significantly reduce the total number of alarms and hosts which must be examined manually, while simultaneously discovering attacks that had previously gone unnoticed. The proposed algorithms are also successful at the discovery of new profiles for multi-stage attacks, and can be used in the automatic generation of meta-alarms, or rules to assist the monitoring infrastructure in performing automated analysis.  We demonstrate that it is possible to successfully rank hosts which comprise the vertices of an Alarm Graph in a manner such that those hosts which are of highest risk for being involved in attack are immediately highlighted for examination or inclusion on hot lists.  We close with an evaluation of 3 sensor profiling algorithms, and show that the order in which alarms are generated is tightly coupled with whether or not they are false positives.  We show that by using time based Markovian analysis of the alarms, we are able to identify alarms which have a high probability of being attacks, and suppress more than 90% of false positives.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study aimed to expand our knowledge of humiliation by examining the cognitive correlates of this emotion.  Since norm violations may often elicit this emotion, attributions of blame and perceived devaluation of the self from others were investigated as possible cognitions that may both link and distinguish this emotion from close emotion relatives, namely embarrassment and shame.Participants were presented with vignettes that described a social versus moral norm violation.  Blame for the event was manipulated by varying who/what caused the norm violation.  Perceived devaluation was manipulated by varying what the observing audience knew about the cause of the norm violation.  Participants were asked to rate the likelihood of their emotional response in addition to the degree of self/other-blame and the likelihood of perceived devaluation.Results revealed that humiliation, embarrassment, and shame may be similar in their relationship to self-blame and perceived devaluation.  All three emotions were reported as more likely for self-caused norm violations than other-caused and accidental norm violations.  Moreover, when the violation was other-caused or accidental, humiliation and embarrassment were reported to be more likely when the audience did not know the cause (higher likelihood of perceived devaluation) than when the audience knew the cause (lower likelihood of perceived devaluation).  Additional support for a link with perceived devaluation was revealed by humiliation and shame being rated higher for self-caused moral violations (higher likelihood of perceived devaluation) than self-caused social violations (lower likelihood of perceived devaluation).Unlike humiliation and embarrassment, shame was found to be rated high in likelihood only when the norm violation was self-caused.  In addition, humiliation was the only of the three emotions related to both audience knowledge of the event cause and type of norm violation.  These results suggest that a relationship with self-blame may be most meaningful for shame, while a relationship with perceived devaluation may be most meaningful for humiliation.Overall, the similarities observed among these emotions suggest that humiliation may be appropriately placed alongside embarrassment and shame within the same emotion family.  Moreover, the observed differences indicate that, while sharing some overlap, humiliation is fundamentally distinct from embarrassment and shame.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation is offered as a work of original scholarship in thefield of Religion and Psychological Studies (RPS).  Through its hermeneutic preservation of Jacob Böhme&apos;s &lt;italic&gt;The Way to Christ&lt;/italic&gt; in &quot;conversation&quot; with selected works of Martin Heidegger, I retrieve the question of imagination&apos;s relation to religious practice, attending to potentials for world transformations disclosed through this relationship, in order to develop a new hermeneutic option for the RPS field concerning this important question.  This new hermeneutic option is developed in such a way as to ensure a subversive compatibility with psychoanalytic hermeneutics—our field&apos;s &lt;italic&gt;koiné&lt;/italic&gt;—while opening to certain radical possibilities of interpretation concerning imagination, desire, religious practice, and world transformations.In the course of the dissertation&apos;s development, issues concerning the western esoteric traditions—Christian theosophy in particular—repentance, guilt, death, new birth, resignation (&lt;italic&gt;Gelassenheit&lt;/italic&gt;), contemplation, and a radical encounter with Sophia are brought to the fore for consideration.  In addition, this dissertation develops its hermeneutic out of the guiding orientation of a weakening ontology that opens a way for the &quot;return of religion&quot; in postmodern hermeneutic discourse, as articulated by Gianni Vattimo.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Grant E. SchmidtTitle: JOB SATISFACTION DETERMINANTS OF CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN THE XYZ SCHOOL DISTRICTAdvisor: Dr. Elinor KatzDegree Date: June 5, 2009ABSTACTJob satisfaction is closely related to motivation theory. Many factors influence human motivation. For example, employee performance is greatly influenced by the expectancy of what the job will provide, the employees attitude toward personal achievement and advancement, and their wish for harmony in the workplace (Bittel, 1990). The amount of opportunity people see in their jobs also has a direct relationship to their job performance (Hill, 1979). Motivation can be provided by allowing employees to participate in the goal-setting activities (Catt, 1989). Motivators, such as sick leave, medical/ dental plans, and holiday pay are best enjoyed by the employees when they are away from their job (McCoy, 1992). The delegation, job enrichment and good listening skills by managers are positive motivational techniques (Frunzi, 1997).The purpose of this study was to identify the current level of employee job satisfaction in the XYZ School District. The term employee refers to certificated staff (i.e., general education teachers, principals, special education teachers, counselors, resource teachers, coaches). There were approximately 130 certificated employees in the XYZ School District.  The research questions asked about level of job satisfaction as related to different demographic dataFor this project, a survey was used to investigate teacher&apos;s level of job satisfaction overall and in three sub-category areas. The object of the survey was not to predict job satisfaction influences, but rather to identify the current state of job satisfaction at one moment in time. The survey addressed any attitudinal differences among teachers that may have related to such demographic data as ethnicity, gender, and length of career. The researcher utilized a survey developed by a task force working for the Governor of North Carolina on his Teacher Working Conditions Initiative. The response rate for the survey was 70%.In this study, employees see leadership as an important predictor of environment, learning, and satisfaction. Thus, hinting that strong levels of job satisfaction as related to the leader (principal) can relate to increase student achievement. For the XYZ school district, satisfaction as related to leadership is low. At the same time, student achievement is poor. Non-classroom certificated staff had a lower level of overall job satisfaction.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Although a growing amount of research in relational maintenance has began to focus intensively on long-distance relationships (LDRs), especially marital, dating, and friendship relationships, little attention has focus on the process of maintaining LDRs in non-Western families. The objective of this study was, first, to explore the experience of Thai adult students who maintain LDRs with their parents. Second, this study identified Thai students&apos; specific relational maintenance behaviors and examined the channels of mediated communication used among Thai adult students and their family members.This study utilized a qualitative method framed by a grounded theory approach to uncover the experience of LDR maintenance of 38 Thai students living in the state of Colorado. Through a constant comparative method of analysis, four underlying categories were identified from the transcriptions of semi-structured interviews: the contact, the medium, the talk, and the motive. This study found that these four categories represented the feelings and behaviors that were interrelated and, when integrated, defined the process of parent-child LDR maintenance. In addition, the process of maintaining a state of distal interaction through main channels (i.e., cell phone) benefited familial relationship maintenance.This LDR maintenance process involved dynamic activities during a conditional separation period between Thai students and their parents. This study extended the literature on maintaining long-distance familial relationships and provided a pattern of action and activities of Thai adult students&apos; LDR maintenance behaviors.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Marginality and Coping: A Communal Contextual Narrative Approach to Pastoral Care With Korean American Christians</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Focusing on Korean American experiences of racism, sexism, and intergenerational conflicts related to the acculturation process, this dissertation examines the social reality of marginality and constructs a communal contextual narrative approach to pastoral care. Current approaches to pastoral care in the Korean American church encourage a deferring style of religious coping that maintains the status quo--the internalized status of marginality--without activating self agency for the fulfillment of one`s own selfhood within the communal life of religious communities. A communally grounded sense of self agency is described in terms of three aspects of Korean indigenous culture: 1) uri (we-ness), 2) jeong (communal empathic connection), and 3) han (the experience of suffering from interdependent injustice).A communal contextual narrative approach challenges the limitations of passive (deferring) ways of coping that disengage personal narratives from biblical narratives. This approach encourages a collaborative coping style, which emphasizes the partnership of human agency with divine agency in the context of the faith community. Asian (Korean) American feminist theologies, along with theologies of divine marginalization are used to describe a process of deconstructing dominant and destructive narratives and reconstructing alternative liberating narratives based on biblical stories about marginalization. In elaborating how to implement this model of pastoral care, this dissertation draws upon 1) narrative therapy approaches developed by White (1990, 2007) and other narrative therapists; 2) the biblical narrative model developed by Wimberly (1994, 2003, and 2008); and 3) the indigenous practice of han-pu-ri as a process of change. Four steps are outlined: 1) evoking sacredness, 2) naming and externalizing the problem, 3) re-authoring one`s story, and 4) re-membering and reconnecting with the community and God.Finally, this dissertation proposes a vision of the Korean American church as an Uri community that continues to weave the human narratives with biblical narratives, in which person, community, and God collaborate as partners for authoring life-giving stories that reflect the full potentiality of life. By reframing negative experiences of marginalization within the larger narratives of both the Uri community and biblical narratives of marginalization, this dissertation challenges Korean immigrants and their families to move from social marginality defined by oppressive narratives to authentic marginality defined by preferred narratives about God.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Poverty increases children&apos;s exposure to stress, elevating their risk for developing patterns of heightened sympathetic and parasympathetic stress reactivity. Repeated patterns of high sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal place children at risk for anxiety disorders. This study evaluated whether providing social support to preschool-age children during mildly stressful situations helps reduce reactivity, and whether this effect partly depends on children&apos;s previously assessed baseline reactivity patterns. The Biological Sensitivity to Context (BSC) theory proposes that highly reactive children may be more sensitive than less reactive children to all environmental influences, including social support. In contrast, conventional physiological reactivity (CPR) theory contends that highly reactive children are more vulnerable to the impact of stress but are less receptive to the potential benefits present within their social environments. In this study, baseline autonomic reactivity patterns were measured. Children were then randomly assigned to a high-support or neutral control condition, and the effect of social support on autonomic response patterns was assessed. Results revealed an interaction between baseline reactivity profiles and experimental condition. Children with patterns of high-reactivity reaped more benefits from the social support in the experimental condition than did their less reactive peers. Highly reactive children experienced relatively less reactivity reduction in the neutral condition while experiencing relatively greater reactivity reduction in the support condition. Despite their demonstrated stability over time, reactivity patterns are also quite susceptible to change at this age; therefore understanding how social support ameliorates reactivity will further efforts to avert stable patterns of high-reactivity among children with high levels of stress, ultimately reducing risk for anxiety disorders.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Considering today&apos;s expeditionary warfare, it is essential the United States military service academies produce cadets and midshipmen who are intrinsically academically motivated, intellectually curious, and ready to meet the diversity of &quot;publics and parliaments&quot; they may influence during worldwide deployments (Scheffer, 2007). Research shows teachers&apos; learner-centered practices that focus on students&apos; needs positively influence college students&apos; academic motivation. The purpose of this study was to measure cadets&apos; levels of academic motivation and perceptions of learner-centered practices at the United States Air Force Academy.This was a quantitative correlational study examining the relationship between cadets&apos; perceptions of five learner-centered domains of practice and seven domains of motivation. The study examined the relationship of class year and five extrinsic motivators to academic motivation. Three on-line administrations of the Assessment of Learner-Centered Practices, College Student Version, collected data from 731 Academy cadets in 23 core academic courses. A factor analysis modified the item definitions of the survey&apos;s learner-centered domains from previous research. The five newly-defined domains were generally considered analogues to previously-defined domains for the purpose of this study.Results indicated the cadets perceived Academy professors to have higher than nationally-sampled levels of establishing relationships and encouraging challenge and responsibility, but lower levels in providing for individual and social learning needs.  Cadets&apos; levels of motivation were significantly lower than the national sample (n = 5,140) in task mastery, work avoidance, and epistemic curiosity but more positive than the national sample in effort avoidance. Regressions showed perceptions of learner-centered practices did significantly predict motivation, but the domains were highly collinear. The composite of perceptions of learner-centered practices accounted for 33% of the variance in positive motivation. The composite only accounted for 8% of the variance in negative motivation. Class year and five extrinsic motivators accounted for less than 2% of the variance in any motivation domain. Regressions showed a small moderating effect of extrinsic motivators on perceptions of practice, but the moderating effect was unclear.This study provided previously-unavailable empirical data regarding academy students, which may be useful for other U.S. service academies. Recommendations for future ALCP research at the service academies are presented.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current investigation utilized a mixed-methods design. In Phase I, 76 ethnic minority graduate students in psychology and counseling Master&apos;s and doctoral programs completed surveys that explored their general experiences in group supervision as well as the occurrence of multicultural events, and positive and negative factors of the reported events. Surveys also assessed supervisees&apos; perspectives of their supervisor&apos;s multicultural competence level, group supervision satisfaction, and their own racial identity and multicultural competence. In Phase II, 20 volunteers from the first phase participated in qualitative interviews that explored in more depth the multicultural event they more briefly discussed in the survey and what factors contributed to this event being a positive or negative experience. Quantitative findings indicated significant, positive relationships between perceived supervisor multicultural competence and group supervision satisfaction, and supervisee multicultural competence and racial identity development. The relationships between racial identity and group supervision satisfaction, and supervisee multicultural competence and group supervision satisfaction were not significant. The relationship between supervisee multicultural competence and perceived supervisor multicultural competence was found to be significant, although not hypothesized. Findings indicated that perceived supervisor multicultural competence was a significant predictor of group supervision satisfaction in a multiple regression when combined with other variables. Themes emerged from the qualitative analyses including what factors contributed to positive and negative experiences. The data were grouped into General, Typical, and Variant responses. Participants reported group leaders being directive, addressing multicultural issues, openness, and the impact of their own ethnic identity as variables that led to positive experiences. Typical responses to negative events included the supervisor being responsible for the outcome, supervisors&apos; multicultural awareness, and not addressing cultural issues. These and other results highlight the implications for both training and practice to effectively address multicultural events in group supervision.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of the study was to measure what factors impact the stress levels of probationary teachers who may or may not be new to the field of education, to determine what demographic characteristics are related to higher levels of stress, to determine what coping resources were successful in reducing stress, and to compare the stress levels and coping resources of probationary teachers to other professionals.The study used the OSI-R to determine the stress levels of k-12 probationary teachers as related to role overload, role insufficiency, role ambiguity, role boundary, responsibility, and physical environment as measured by the Occupational Roles Questionnaire (ORQ) sub scale of the OSI-R. The study determined the coping resources used by these teachers as measured by the Personal Resources Questionnaire (PRQ) of the OSI-R which measures recreation, self-care, social support, and rational/ cognitive coping.Of the 140 people who were sent the survey, 91 responded which was areturn rate of 65%. Majority of the respondents were female primarily between the ages of 20 and 49. The average years of experience in education was 7.67 years with most being of the &quot;veteran&quot; category having been in the field of education more than five years.The results indicated that there was a significant difference betweenprobationary teachers and other professionals for the Role Overload, Role Insufficiency, and Role Ambiguity, Self-Care, and Social Support scales. Beginners, within 0-1 years of educational experience, reported statistically significant scores as compared to their more experience counterparts on the Role Ambiguity scale.Probationary teachers are more stressed than other professionals andfeel that their training, education, skills, and experience are either inadequate or inappropriate for the requirements of their jobs. They also reported higher levels of stress in relation to which their priorities, expectations, and evaluation criteria were clear when compared to other professionals. They have a greater ability to coping with stress by completing personal activities to alleviate stress and feel moresignificantly supported and helped by those around them when compared to other professionals.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This present work explores the relationship of Joseph Conrad&apos;s status as a Polish exile to his creative and biographical work. Its main focus is on the tandem publications of the novel Under Western Eyes and his autobiographical volume A Personal Record, both published within a year of each other and written contemporaneously. The first chapter is a short biographical survey of Conrad&apos;s life and addresses some later biographical works by his wife, among others. An overview of critical works that deal with Under Western Eyes is presented in the second chapter. An investigation into narrative structure and its use in creating a heteroglossic text is investigated in the third chapter. How this strategy reflects Conrad&apos;s personal stake in the novel and how the novel and its creation affected the author&apos;s ability to cope with his own homo-duplex geographies is also addressed herein. The fourth chapter then concerns itself with Conrad&apos;s attempt to create a truly heteroglossic, autobiographically based persona for public consumption in Britain, while keeping true to his function as a `cultural bridge&apos;. An early effort at communicating the exile&apos;s predicament and failure to bridge the cultural divide in the story `Amy Foster&apos; is taken up in the fifth and final chapter. The legacy of Conrad&apos;s effort is also discussed herein as relevant to the work of Milan Kundera and Erich Maria Remarque.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>PARAMETRIC MODEL OF HEAD RELATED TRANSFER FUNCTIONS BASED ON SYSTEMATIC MOVEMENTS OF POLES AND ZEROS WITH SOUND LOCATION FOR POLE/ZERO MODELS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Directional transfer functions (DTFs), the directional components of the Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), are generally measured at finite locations in azimuth and elevation. Thus models are needed to synthesize DTFs at finer spatial resolution than the measured data to create complete virtual auditory displays. In this research, minimum-phase all-pole and all-zero models were used for modeling both human and cat DTFs. Real cepstrum analysis has been used to represent minimum phase HRTFs in the time domain. For the human DTFs, model orders were chosen to achieve specific objective error criteria published in previous studies that were based on subjective listening tests. Because subjective listening tests are not always feasible in animals, objective methods must be used to assess the quality of the DTF reconstructions.  The same error criteria reported in subjective tests of human DTF reconstructions was used to constrain models of cat DTFs on the assumption that if humans cannot discriminate reconstructed vs empirical DTFs for a given objective reconstruction error criteria, then cats won&apos;t be able to either. All-pole and all-zero models of orders as low as 25 were able to model DTFs with errors comparable to previous research findings and preserve the main spectral features in both human and cat DTFs.A hypothesis that a systematic relation (i.e., parametric equations) can be found to describe the movements of the poles/zeros of the successful models with the change in sound source location was tested. Polynomials of different orders were extracted to describe the movements of the poles in all-pole models and zeros in all-zero models with the change in sound source location. The reconstructed DTFs were compared to the measured ones of same locations. The reconstructed DTFs preserved the main shape of the spectra, provided satisfactory RMS errors compared to the measured ones and accurately preserved the first notch spectral feature.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The objective of the current study was to examine whether change in adolescent conflict resolution in romantic relationships is predicted by adolescents&apos; prior interactions with mothers and friends. A community sample of 191 adolescents (96 female), representative of the U.S. population, their mothers and close friends participated in this study. Data collection began when adolescents were in 10th grade (¬Average age = 15.9, SD = .52) and continued for the next five and a half years. Results indicated that teens engaged in positive problem solving, withdrawal, and compliance far more frequently than in aggressive conflict resolution strategies. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze growth curves. Results indicated linear increases in problem solving and withdrawal over the course of late adolescence and early adulthood. Levels of compliance, verbal aggression, and physical aggression stayed the same on average. Of all predictors examined in this study, teens&apos; negative interactions and observed conflict with friends appeared particularly predictive of conflict resolution behavior with a romantic partner in 10th grade.  Support and communication skills with friends and mothers were predictive of conflict resolution behavior over time. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Survey data from a study of 6th grade students in Colorado (n=860) were used to estimate structural equation models in which peer victimization types were hypothesized to have significant relationships with both student engagement and attendance. Then, student engagement and attendance variables were hypothesized to have significant effects on achievement (measured as grade point average). Student engagement was viewed as a multi-faceted construct, composed of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional aspects. Four different types of peer victimization variables  (verbal, physical, exclusion, and intensity) were combined to form a latent measure for peer victimization that was expected to predict absenteeism and student engagement. In addition, student engagement was expected to act as a mediating variable between the peer victimization latent variable and absenteeism. A model treating peer victimization and student engagement as latent variables fit the data well. However, the peer victimization latent variable was not statistically significantly predictive of absenteeism as was hypothesized.Other paths between endogenous and exogenous variables, although statistically significant, had relatively weak path coefficients suggesting that victimization does not largely impact attendance for the 6th grade students. In fact, the path coefficients between student engagement and attendance were also weak. In conclusion, the relationships between peer victimization, student engagement, and attendance were simply not as strong as hypothesized. However, the structural equation models did demonstrate that school engagement mediates the effect of peer victimization on attendance and achievement. A suggestion for further study would be to examine the &quot;school avoidance&quot; component of the study; perhaps, an attendance variable would be more significantly impacted by peer victimization for older students who have less parental influence on their daily attendance. In addition, a longitudinal study with more measures of student behaviors across time might better capture the effect of peer victimization on the various school behavior variables.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Perceived Closeness to the Deceased and its Predictive Effect on the Development of Prolonged Grief Disorder and Suicidality among Bereaved College Students</dc:title>

  <dc:description>A growing percentage of college students are experiencing severe and debilitating psychological problems (Caulfield, 2000; Douce, 2004; Kitzrow, 2003).  Despite being a commonly-encountered stressor among undergraduates (Currier et al., 2006), the occurrence of bereavement is addressed rarely among the college mental health literature.  However, bereavement has been shown to lead to increased suicidality and other problematic mental health symptoms (Prigerson, Bridge et al., 1999).  Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), a newly-defined mental health diagnosis, has been found to be a more accurate indicator of poorer mental health functioning among bereaved individuals than other mental health conditions (Silverman et al., 2000).  Some research suggests that the level of perceived emotional closeness felt toward the deceased is of great importance when assessing one&apos;s grief response (Archer, 1999; Cleiren, 1993).  This study explored the relationship between perceived closeness to the deceased, PGD, and suicidality.  The Personal Acquaintance Measure (PAM; Starzyk et al., 2006) was used to quantitatively assess perceived closeness.  Bereaved undergraduates from a large college in the Western United States were asked to assess their levels of prolonged grief symptomotology, suicidality, and perceived closeness to a deceased person of their choosing.  Hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between these variables.  The results indicate that perceived closeness to the deceased accounted for a significant amount of the variance in PGD symptom severity, but not suicidality.  The results also suggest that suicidality should be assessed in addition to, and separately from, PGD in order to avoid overlooking those who do not meet the criteria for PGD yet who are suicidal nonetheless.  Additional clinical implications, limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are addressed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The stigma of mental health problems between Mexican Americans and White non-Hispanic European Americans was investigated and measured by attitudes toward seeking help and the amount of social distance desired from individuals with mental health problems. The stigma of mental health has been identified as a barrier to accessing mental health services among Mexican Americans and men in general. Men from both groups access mental health services at a significantly lower rate than women from both groups. This study contributed to research and practice by examining the possible differences in the level of stigma toward mental health problems between Mexican Americans and White non-Hispanic European Americans. This study also explored the relationship between Mexican Americans&apos; acculturation level as well as selected demographic variables and the stigma of mental health problems. There were no significant ethnic or gender differences in the level of stigma toward mental health between the two groups. However, there was a significant gender difference within the White non-Hispanic European American group. Results also indicated that there was no significant relationship between Mexican Americans&apos; acculturation level and the amount of stigma toward mental health. However, there was a significant positive correlation between Mexican Americans&apos; age and the amount of social distance desired from individuals with mental health problems.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis is concerned with problems involving permutations.   The main focus is on connections between permutation patterns and reduced decompositions with few repetitions.   Connections between permutation patterns and reduced decompositions were first studied various mathematicians including Stanley, Billey and Tenner.  In particular, they studied pattern avoidance conditions on reduced decompositions with no repeated elements.  This thesis classifies the pattern avoidance and containment conditions on reduced decompositions with one and two elements repeated.   This classification is then used to obtain new enumeration results for pattern classes related to the reduced decompositions and introduces the technique of counting pattern classes via reduced decompositions.  In particular, counts on pattern classes involving 1 or 2 copies of the patterns 321 and 3412 are obtained.    Pattern conditions are then used to classify and enumerate downsets in the Bruhat order for the symmetric group and the rook monoid which is a generalization of the symmetric group.   Finally, motivated by coding theory, the concepts of displacement, additive stretch and multiplicative stretch of permutations are introduced.   These concepts are then analyzed with respect to maximality and distribution as a new prospect for improving interleaver design.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to portray the experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual educators in PK-12 schools in the State of Colorado. This aim emerged from my own personal experiences, previous research, and the current status of state and federal laws.  This research focused on the experiences of 15 lesbian, gay, bisexual and allied identified teachers, including myself.This study focused on a primary research question:  What are the experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual PK-12 educators as they manage their sexual orientation identities within a teaching role?Heuristics was the qualitative methodology best suited to address this question.  Heuristics is a process, which combines personal passions and inquiry to illuminate larger universal significance.  For this study, I used a three interview protocol, extensive journaling and member checking. There are six distinct phases of heuristics in order to maintain methodological integrity.  The final phase was creative synthesis where I used poetic transcription to capture the experiences of my participants.In addition to making critical decisions around the heuristics methodology, my theoretical framework of Queer Theory, challenged me to explore varying dimensions of the research study, my personal journey, and those of the participants. Queer Theory is about de-centering, fluidity, and a wider view into identities, both marginalized and mainstream. This framework was central to grappling with the data and information that did not mirror my own experience or political stance regarding being &quot;out&quot; in the classroom.This study is a step in beginning to uncover the components of many lesbian, gay, and bisexual educators, as each poem further adds to the shallow body of existing literature. During the research process seven themes emerged:  experience, personality, philosophy, isolation vs. support, non-negotiables, sense of self, and navigations.  Using the seven themes as a guide, the reader can begin to appreciate the complexities and nuances of how one manages sexual orientation in a teaching role.  This guide will be useful to various stakeholders, including state and federal policymakers, administrators, and teachers as they try to better inform their practices and create inclusive environments in schools.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Quantifying Soil and Groundwater Chemistry in Areas Invaded by Tamarix spp. Along the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico</dc:title>

  <dc:description>&lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; spp. (a.k.a. saltcedar, tamarisk) invasion is considered a major ecological threat at both national and global levels, with supposed impacts on soil and water chemistry.  One of the most often cited mechanisms of ecosystem change by &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; is through its ability to deposit salty exudates and salt-rich leaf litter. The degree to which &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; relates to elevated soil and groundwater salinity, however, has not been adequately quantified, especially in the context of environmental factors that may also influence salinity.  If &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; does elevate localized salinity by means of uptake, concentration and exudation by plant tissues, then we might expect that the magnitude of its impact would be influenced by stand features such as density and age.  Therefore, we analyzed soil and groundwater salinity associated with &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; stands across a gradient of densities and aboveground ages along an arid reach of the Middle Rio Grande in Central New Mexico.   Stands were sampled both in areas exposed to and deprived of flooding to account for potential hydrologic impacts on soil and groundwater chemistry.  Paired soil samples were collected underneath &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; canopies and in adjacent open areas to compare solute concentrations associated with &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; cover to those in soils exposed to greater rates of surface evaporation.  Results indicate that flooding may be the most important factor for assessing floodplain salinity as the presence of this flushing mechanism was related to the lowest salt levels.  Surface soil salinity was observed to increase with greater &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; stem diameter (a predictor of age) in areas deprived of flooding; however a hyperbolic pattern where salt level is highest under intermediate-aged growth and lowest underneath younger and older canopies seems to better explain the variability associated with salt level change by age.  &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; density was not observed to influence soil salinity, but higher densities were associated with elevated groundwater salinity in flood-suppressed areas.  Soils under &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; canopies had lower surface soil salinity than open areas deprived of flooding suggesting that surface evaporation may contribute more to surface soil salinity than &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; or may exacerbate contributions by leaf exudates.  This research provides a unique opportunity to quantify the degree to which an invasive species can alter its environment.  Results can be used to guide management decisions related to native species revegetation of &lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt;-invaded areas.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study tested a model of factors affecting cohabiting couples&apos; relational financial satisfaction, defined as the contentment an individual has with how financial issues are handled within his or her domestic romantic relationship, and examined the relations within these factors. This study was a cross-sectional online survey of 266 participants (81% female; 85% Caucasian) recruited from listservs and subsequent snowball sampling. Measures assessed couples&apos; financial strain, dedication commitment, financial conflict, financial trust, financial equality and financial communication. Relational financial satisfaction (RFS) was significantly related to financial conflict, financial strain and dedication commitment. Financial conflict mediated the association between financial trust and RFS, as well as between financial communication and RFS. Financial trust and communication mediated the association between financial equality and financial conflict. In addition, RFS was related to but distinct from relationship satisfaction. This study revealed components important to consider in the assessment and treatment of couples&apos; financial relationships.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>REMEMBERING LIBERAL FEMINISM IN RADICAL WAYS: LOCATING CONSERVATIVE STRATEGIES IN THE NARRATIVES OF DR. CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, TAMMY BRUCE, AND DR. LAURA SCHLESSINGER</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation identifies and challenges post-feminist narratives that remember the second wave or 1960s and 1970s liberal feminism as a radical form of activism. The narratives of three prominent post-feminist authors: Dr. Christina Hoff Sommers, Tammy Bruce and Dr. Laura Schlessinger are used as examples of how identification works as a rhetorical device that motivates individual actors to join in a struggle against liberal and radical feminist ideologies.  I argue that each author draws on classically liberal and politically conservative virtues to define a &quot;true&quot; feminism that is at odds with alternative feminist commitments.  I demonstrate how these authors create a subject position of a &quot;true feminist&quot; that is reminiscent of the classically liberal suffragist. In Burkean terms, each author constitutes the suffragist as a friend and juxtaposes her with the enemy--modern liberal and radical feminists.  I articulate the consequences of such dialectical portrayals of feminist activism and further suggest that these authors&apos; visions of feminism reinforce patriarchal practices, urging women to assimilate into a classically liberal society at the cost of social justice. In opposition to their memories of feminism, I offer a radical democratic approach of remembering feminism that is less concerned with the definition of feminism or feminist than it is with holistically addressing oppression and what oppression means to subjugated populations.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Representational Subversions and the Limits of Postcoloniality: Shahzia Sikander&apos;s Strategic Contemporaneity</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Transnational artist Shahzia Sikander challenges the limitations of Edward Said&apos;s postcolonial emphasis on secular humanism by deploying the heterogeneous traditions of South Asian miniature painting while strategically drawing on tradition to critique contemporaneity.  Through a palimpsest process of composition, Sikander reincorporates the unknown and silenced histories implicit in the tradition of miniature painting to create social imaginaries with motifs that draw on the diverse traditions of South Asian religions and aesthetics to create a subversive politics of remembering wherein alternative images of cosmopolitanism emerge.  Through a sustained analysis, this dissertation demonstrates how these alternative traditions interrogate and critique the limitations of postcolonial theory.  Particularly important to this critique are some recent approaches of Third World feminists that highlight the limitations of secular humanism implicit in much of postcolonial critique.  Sikander&apos;s compositions mirror these approaches as her motifs of the feminine become an intervention into the spiritual emptiness and ethical confusions of contemporaneity.  In effect, Sikander&apos;s work is an intervention, a warning, and a plea for the re-invention of positive alternatives as her images embody and facilitate a critical and daring consciousness that is necessary to both our social and spiritual well-being.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Research has focused on identifying mechanisms that increase revictimization risk in women, such as risk detection (i.e., ability to identify threat).  While risk detection deficits have been linked to revictimization in college samples, individual differences that might predict risk detection deficiencies remain unclear.  In this study, 94 women recruited from the community performed a risk detection task by listening to an audiotape of a risky dating situation.  We obtained parasympathetic (e.g., vagal tone) and sympathetic (e.g., pre-ejection period) activation, heart rate, and self-reported emotional responding while participants completed the task.  We also assessed participants&apos; trauma histories and relevant symptoms.  Results suggested that community women with less self-reported reactivity detect risk faster than women with more self-reported reactivity.  Women who detected risk faster also displayed a discrepancy between sympathetic versus self-reported reactivity.  For women who detected risk at a slow rate, an interaction between trauma and symptom levels significantly predicted risk detection latency.  Implications of reactivity associated with risk detection abilities are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Role Expectations and State Socialization: Germany&apos;s Rediscovery of the Use of Force 1990-1995</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation engages the question of why German political elites accepted the use of force during the 1990s and started to commit the country&apos;s armed forces to multilateral peacekeeping missions. Previous governments of the Federal Republic had opposed foreign deployment of the military and Germany was characterized by a unique strategic culture in which the efficacy of military force was widely regarded as negative. The rediscovery of the use of force constituted a significant reorientation of German security policy with potentially profound implications for international relations.I use social role theory to explain Germany&apos;s security policy reorientation. I argue that political elites shared a national role conception of their country as a dependable and reliable ally. Role expectations of the international security environment changed as a result of a general shift to multilateral intervention as means to address emerging security problems after the Cold War. Germany&apos;s resistance to the use of force was viewed as inappropriate conduct for a power possessing the economic and military wherewithal of the Federal Republic. Elites from allied countries exerted social pressure to have Germany contribute commensurate with capabilities. German political elites adapted role behavior in response to external expectations in an effort to preserve the national role conception of a dependable and reliable ally.Security policy reorientation to maintain Germany&apos;s national role conception was pursued by conservative elites who acted as &apos;role entrepreneurs&apos;. CDU/CSU politicians initiated a process of role adaptation to include the use of force for non-defensive missions. They persuaded Social Democrats and Alliance 90/Green party politicians that the maintenance of the country&apos;s role conception necessitated a reorientation in security policy to accommodate the changes in the security environment.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Evidence of the influence of engagement on learning and achievement iswell established.  There is also indication of a test-score gap between poorstudents and middle class students as well as among racial and ethnic groups.This gap continues to be a top priority in educational reform.  Since theachievement gap continues to widen for many school districts and states,investigating the possible connection between the engagement gap and theachievement gap deserves needed attention.This study sought to determine the differences in school engagement andachievement levels between students from low and high-SES backgrounds, asmeasured by free and reduced lunch, and between Caucasian and Hispanicstudents.  The study examined the engagement and achievement levels ofapproximately 1,200 sixth grade middle school students in a suburban Coloradoschool district.The students&apos; responses were then analyzed using independent sample t-tests to determine differences.  The major findings of this statistical analysis werethat slight differences exist between Caucasian and Hispanic students as well aslow and high-SES students on the 2007 CSAP scores in reading, writing, math,and science scores and first trimester GPA for the 2007-2008 school year.  Inaddition, there were minimal differences between Hispanic and Caucasianstudents and low and high-SES students in behavioral engagement, but not incognitive or emotional engagement.This study has taken an in-depth look at engagement levels, anddifferences in achievement were also explored.  This study has confirmed that anachievement gap exists.  However, the results of this study have shown that theachievement gap cannot be explained by an engagement gap.  Based on the resultsof this study, stressing the importance of engagement in school is not likely theanswer for closing the achievement gap.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Self-Advocacy Experiences of College Students With Learning Disabilities and/or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Self-advocacy is identified as a factor important to the success of college students with Learning Disabilities (LD) and/or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, educators do not yet know enough about the experience of self-advocacy in the post-secondary learning environment to effectively guide students in the development of this complex set of skills. This study was designed to describe the experience of college students with LD and/or ADHD as they advocate for themselves in the college or university environment and to compare the students&apos; experiences as self-advocates to what educators believe to be true about self-advocacy based on the existing literature. The study employed a series of case studies conducted with phenomenological methodology. The data revealed that students experience self-advocacy as a means of building a working relationship with faculty, a means of declaring their character, a weapon to do battle when conflicts arise, and a means to assign the LD/ADHD a role within their learning experience. Data confirmed the importance of communication, assertiveness, knowledge of LD/ADHD, academic self-concept, self-efficacy and locus of control, and problem-solving skills. The above factors were assembled into a framework describing their functioning in concert to facilitate self-advocacy. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the sibling relationship during the young adult years. Specifically, this study explored how turning points and everyday talk related to closeness and relational satisfaction among college age siblings. One-hundred and ninety-nine young adult participants completed a detailed questionnaire about their relationship with a sibling. Results indicated that (a) geographic distance does not have a significant effect on the closeness among siblings, (b) everyday talk was expressed in terms of three categories: expressions of intimacy, maintenance talk, and relationally risky talk, (c) all three categories of everyday talk related to closeness, while only expressions of intimacy was related to relational satisfaction, (d) there were nine turning point categories (time together, school, family issues, support, moving, change in the family structure, avoidance, conflict, and graduation) that siblings experienced during the young adult years and each related uniquely to closeness, and (e) seven unique patterns of closeness (gradual increase in closeness, sustained high degree of closeness, single disruption of low closeness, single disruptions of high closeness, multiple disruptions of closeness beginning low, sustained moderate degree of closeness, gradual decrease in closeness, and multiple disruptions of closeness beginning high) that siblings experienced during the young adult years.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Jacquelynn Anne TruckeyTitle: Social and Emotional Factors and Achievement PatternsAmongst High Ability LearnersAdvisor: Dr. Elinor KatzDegree Date: August 2009AbstractResearch indicates that social and emotional factors play a veryimportant role in the achievement levels of all learners andespecially so for gifted populations. This qualitative multi-case study was designed to explore, with a sample of secondary level gifted students, their lived experiences and the influences that contribute to their learning success. The rationale for this study stems from the researcher&apos;s desire to discover ways to better support secondary gifted students and to help them find more engagement and passion in school.The purposefully selected sample was composed of five students at the middle and high school levels who had been previously identified as gifted. Additionally, another 17 participants (parents, teachers, administrators, counselors, and one school board member) were included in the study to lend further insight into the experiences of the student participants. The primary data collection method was in-depth interviews. Supportive methods included multiple classroom observations and document analysis. The data were coded and organized according to the researcher&apos;s questions. Analysis and interpretation of findings were organized according to this abbreviated conceptual framework: (a) Intrinsic and extrinsic influences; (b) Programming; (c) Achievement; (d) Relationships; (e) Affective struggles; (f) Understanding;This research revealed that affective factors influenced these students greatly (in positive and negative ways) and these social and emotional student needs are rarely addressed at school. Further, it was discovered that the students lacked meaningful relationships with teachers at school and that there was a general lack of understanding about giftedness across all sections of this learning community.Recommendations are made for the school district, specific school sites, teachers, parents, and students as well as for future research possibilities.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The term coparenting implies a bioparental dyad that often excludes the stepparent&apos;s role in sharing parenting across joint-custody households. Focusing solely on this dyad also precludes gaining an understanding of how stepfamily couples manage together the communication and sharing of parental responsibilities with the parent(s) in the shared children&apos;s other home. In a departure from this bioparental dyad-focused approach, this study locates the stepfamily couple at the center of an inquiry into managing coparenting across households. This mixed methods design study included in-depth interviews of 32 stepfamily couples whose narratives about coparenting were analyzed using grounded theory methods. Forty-one percent of stepparents engage in direct coparenting communication, sometimes manifested as the coactive approach identified in this study. Stepfamily couples also involve the stepparent indirectly in coparenting communication, through the conferred and consultative approaches. As well, the couples&apos; narratives about coparenting identify them as either united, where they share the experience, or divided, where coparenting is reserved exclusively for the bioparent to manage. The stepfamily couples&apos; narratives about significant coparenting experiences revealed that they experience and make sense of coparenting as 1) struggling, 2) coping, or 3) thriving. No significant relationship was found between marital satisfaction and experiencing coparenting as strugglers, copers or thrivers. Grounded theory analysis of these narratives also reflects the four dichotomous dimensions of 1) regard-disregard, 2) decency-duplicity, 3) facilitation-interference, and 4) accommodation-inflexibility. Significant incidents located along these dimensions contribute to the stepfamily couples&apos; identification as struggling, coping, or thriving in coparenting. Experiences on the extreme ends of the dichotomous dimensions generate positive and negative turning points for the coparenting interactions and relationships. As well, experiences on the negative end of the dimensional poles can present challenges for the stepfamily couples. Finally, a synthesis of the findings related to the dichotomous dimensions generates a theory of shared parenting values expectancy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Despite a current climate that often undervalues the arts in education, arts-centered schools and school reform continue to proliferate. This study describes, interprets and evaluates arts-centered school reform which is defined within this study as &lt;italic&gt;the comprehensive and intentional restructuring and re-culturing of schools using the theories and practices of the arts and arts-learning as the primary basis for educational change decisions&lt;/italic&gt; to uncover its aims, practices and significance.Four research questions guided this study: 1) What are the aims of arts-centered school reformers in the two schools studied? 2) What does arts-centered school reform look like in practice? 3) What is the educational significance of arts-centered school reform as it is represented in the two schools studied? 4) What educational import do these examples of arts-centered school reform have for American public school reform in general? Educational connoisseurship and criticism is the methodology used to investigate arts-centered school reform. Educational criticism is composed of four dimensions, &lt;italic&gt;description, interpretation, evaluation, and thematics&lt;/italic&gt;.Findings suggest that arts-centered school reformers have two basic aims: 1) to offer students a balanced experience in school by embracing a holistic vision of learning and childhood; and 2) to create a collaborative culture in the classroom that supports arts-learning and arts-centered school reform. The practices of arts-centered school reformers are explained in terms of five types of &lt;italic&gt;arts-embedded situations&lt;/italic&gt; found in arts-centered classrooms and schools. These five arts-embedded situations include situations of: arts-mindedness, artistry, home, growth and caring, and expressiveness.The author explores the significance of arts-centered school reform as a meaning-making enterprise by examining five realms of meaning within the curriculum: the cognitive realm, imaginative realm, the democratic realm, the community realm, and the personal realm. The author surmises that these five realms support arts-centered school reform as spaces for students to locate their own meanings in education.Six conclusions are drawn from these examples of arts-centered school reform. 1) Arts-centered school reformers internalize arts-centered school reform as a state of mind; 2) Arts-centered school reform cannot only be internalized as a state of mind but requires vision, structure, and action; 3) Arts-centered school reform demonstrates a shared aesthetic; 4) Arts-centered school reform is best implemented as a set of relational and personal ideals expressed through teacher created experiences, encounters, and arts-embedded situations; 5) Arts-centered school reform requires a public presence in the community to thrive; and 6) Arts-centered school reformers offer an ethic of arts-engagement that is vital to our sense of cultural democracy.  Finally, the educational import of arts-centered school reform for American public education is discussed and suggestions for further research are also offered.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Reports indicate that in the United States disproportionate numbers of African American children are represented in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Studies also indicate disparities in the provision of services to African American young people. Some researchers claim that poverty is the cause. Others blame the high incidence of single-parent families. Others contend that individuals&apos; biases and our racist systems are to blame.  While it is almost certain that each of the aforementioned causes and many other factors contribute to disparate outcomes and the overrepresentation of African Americans in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems, this project presupposes that causation is deeply rooted and intricately interconnected with the history of racism and injustice by the child protective system towards African American people.Indeed, examining respondent parents, child protective services workers, attorneys and judges lived experiences within the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, this qualitative study contends that a major cause for the disparities and disproportionalities is the correlation between race and the social cognition processes that subconsciously occurs within all communicants and is enacted through their communication. The process in which individuals exchange information provides entry into one of many potential areas of study that have previously received little attention from researchers related to the issue of disparities and disproportionalities. Utilizing a phenomenological approach, this study relies on in-depth, semi-structured interviews to collect and analyze the data.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Doctrine of Christian Perfection for Today: Reading Wesley&apos;s Theology through the Lens of Process Thought</dc:title>

  <dc:description>A process-theological reading of Wesley&apos;s doctrine of perfection, by constructing an adequate concept of God in process, gives renewed importance and vitality to Wesley&apos;s doctrine of perfection, a doctrine that has been confused and virtually ignored even by Methodists themselves, despite the central importance Wesley himself assigns it.  Why, then, has Wesley&apos;s doctrine of perfection been so often misunderstood, confused or even ignored from his time until today?  The clue to the answer lies in the failure clearly to heed the distinction between the two senses of divine perfection: perfected perfection (a static state of perfection) and perfecting perfection (a never ending aspiration for all of loves perfecting fullness).I suggest that the notion of perfected perfection in God&apos;s essence is not theologically adequate, given the Christian belief in God as love.  What should be rejected is the idea of perfection as perfected, influenced by the Greeks, in which love in its essence as relation is impossible.  The problem of this doctrine of perfection as perfected will not be solved without first constructing an adequate concept of God in perfecting perfection, that is, God in process.  The primary method that I will use is, thus, theological construction.  By constructing God in process, I want to recapture the doctrine of perfection as perfecting in Wesley&apos;s theology.  For Wesley, Christian perfection, that is, perfecting perfection, is a life of love that is interchangeably love of God and love of creatures.  I believe that a process interpretation of Christian perfection clarifies the relational love for God and the world at the heart of Wesley&apos;s doctrine of perfection.  Process metaphysics can provide a theological foundation to construct an adequate concept of God in perfecting perfection, in which God and the world can enjoy perfect love that is ever growing.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the various factors at the individual, family, and community level that helped the adult individuals survive the trans-oceanic tsunami which hit the coastal areas of India on December 26, 2004.The study made use of a concurrent mixed methods design to achieve the above objective. The quantitative section of the research examined the effects of individual, family, and community factors on adult post-traumatic growth. The qualitative section of the study sought to capture the subjective experience of the tsunami survivors using a phenomenological approach. The target population were adults, aged 18 to 55 from Kerala, India, who were exposed to the tsunami natural disaster of 2004. Using the purposive sampling method, I recruited 301 participants for the quantitative research and 8 participants for the qualitative research. Analysis of the quantitative data, using hierarchical regression analysis, revealed that religion, employment, family type, family flexibility, and family communication were the significant predictors of post-traumatic growth. Analysis of the qualitative data, using the modified form of the Van Kaam&apos;s method of phenomenological analysis, revealed 6 major themes, including the subjective experience of encountering killer waves, the subjective experience during rescue and relief phase, the subjective experience during recovery process, resources at the personal, family, and community level, obstacles to recovery, and recommendations to improve disaster services. Implications for social work practice, research and education, and policy were discussed. The findings of this study may enhance the ability of social scientists to influence disaster-related practice, policy, and research in India.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The goal of this research was to provide a comprehensive investigation of the emotional experience of humiliation by examining: (1) the direct effects of self-esteem and narcissism on emotional responses to potentially humiliating events; (2) the direct effects of the emotional correlates of humiliating experiences (i.e. sadness, humiliation, and anger) on the related behavioral reactions to such events (i.e., withdrawal, retaliation, and minimization); and (3) a process model to determine whether or not the emotional correlates of potentially humiliating events mediated the predicted effects of self-esteem and narcissism on the behavioral consequences on those events.Participants, ranging in age from 18 to 25, were recruited via social networking websites and undergraduate psychology courses. The data were collected through an online survey tool that presented participants with 8 vignettes, describing mild to extreme humiliation-provoking events. Following each vignette, participants were asked to identify with the protagonist (the victim of the humiliating event) and answer a series of questions related to how their anticipated emotional and behavioral reactions to the hypothetical event. Analyses were based on the responses of 210 individuals.Path analysis revealed that withdrawal behaviors were significantly predicted by low levels of self-esteem and high levels of sadness and humiliation. Self-esteem also had an indirect effect on withdrawal, through its association with humiliation. Retaliation was predicted by high levels of narcissism. Anger and humiliation were also associated with retaliation. There was an indirect positive effect of narcissism on retaliation, through its relationship with anger. The positive relationship between humiliation and retaliation was altered once anger was controlled for. Finally, high levels of minimization were associated with low levels of anger. Additionally, narcissism had a very small, but significant, indirect effect on minimization, whereby lower levels of narcissism led to decreases in participants&apos; tendencies to feel angry, following a potentially humiliating event, which resulted in greater endorsement of minimization behaviors. Implications were discussed, as were suggestions for future research. Conclusions emphasized the need for a developmental understanding of these processes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The critical role of parent involvement has been endorsed by educators and educational policy in the United States. However, various definitions and approaches to assess parent involvement have yielded inconsistent conclusions regarding the impact of parent involvement on child development and failed to provide foundations for practitioners. These contradictory findings, at least in part, reflected that parent involvement is a multidimensional construct which should be captured by many behaviors and activities as well as the limitations of using classical test theory to develop/identify items to assess parent involvement.This study conducted both CTT and IRT to identify optimal items for assessing parent involvement from kindergarten through the fifth grade using the ECLS-K dataset. 25 items administrated across four data analysis waves were selected to examine the longitudinal factor structure of parent involvement in early childhood. EFA, CFA and multidimensional IRT have yielded the same results that a three-factor model, including school/home involvement, home educational investment, and family routines, fit the data best across time. Additionally, the result of factor invariance indicated that the three-factor model existed from kindergarten through the fifth grade. The results of a Rasch model analysis suggested revising and adding appropriate items for assessing home educational investment and family routines due to low reliability and poor item ordering.The impact of parent involvement on academic achievement was examined at kindergarten, first, third, and fifth grade respectively, using multiple regression analyses. Also, this study examined the longitudinal influence of parent involvement using latent growth modeling. It was found that the predictive strengthen of domains of parent involvement varied at different time point as well as across four data analysis waves.The present study provided empirical evidence using advanced statistical techniques to support a valid multi-faceted structure of the construct and its stability and impact on academic achievement during early childhood. It would deepen researchers and practitioners&apos; knowledge of how to assess parent involvement from kindergarten through elementary school years using a multidimensional perspective, and how it is related to children&apos;s education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation seeks to answer the question: Under what conditions does multiparty mediation fail to move conflicting parties toward a comprehensive peace agreement? The object of study is the Middle East Quartet of Mediators from its formation in 2002 to the Annapolis Conference in November, 2007. Although some progress was made during this period, no formal peace agreement was reached and therefore, the ultimate objective of the Quartet was not attained. The study seeks both to deepen our theoretical understanding of multiparty mediation as well as identify specific leverage points that could lead toward resolution of the conflict in Palestine and Israel.The methodology employed is a qualitative investigation of the multiparty mediation efforts of the Quartet.  It is based on an investigation of Quartet statements as well as a series of interviews of key Quartet participants and academic experts on the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  The ultimate aim is to make future mediation efforts more successful.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Passions and Self-esteem in Mary Astell&apos;s Early Feminist Prose</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines the influence of Cambridge Platonism and materialist philosophy on Mary Astell&apos;s early feminism.  More specifically, I argue that Astell co-opts Descartes&apos;s theory of regulating the passions in his final publication, The Passions of the Soul, to articulate a comprehensive, Enlightenment and body friendly theory of feminine self-esteem that renders her feminism modern.   My analysis of Astell&apos;s theory of feminine self-esteem follows both textual and contextual cues, thus  allowing for a reorientation of her early feminism vis-a-vis contemporary feminist theory .   An entire chapter in the dissertation is devoted to Astell&apos;s use of Descartes&apos;s theory of regulating the passions to render women more substantial and inherently worthy.  This rendering becomes more concrete in Astell&apos;s feminist framework as she employs the language of the social contract  in her fourth publication, Reflections Upon Marriage, to depict wives as contractual slaves.  I argue that her assertion concerning women&apos;s slavery is theoretically consistent when read in light of her theory of feminine self-esteem, since this theory is based on the Enlightenment principles of self-mastery, independence and self-preservation.  Further, I align Astell&apos;s early feminism in a dialogic sense with the Continental &quot;querelle des femmes,&quot; especially as presented in writings by Christine de Pizan and Agrippa.  Astell, I argue, contributes to the &quot;querelle&quot; by framing the feminist problem she wishes to solve concerning women&apos;s equality (despite bodily &quot;inferiority&quot;) in a robust , philosophical manner that uncannily prefigures Wollstonecraft&apos;s call for the universalization of human virtues and the reform of of women&apos;s education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>During adolescence, peers become increasingly important sources of social support for youth.  In addition to discussing the trials and tribulations of daily life, it is possible that youth are having intimate conversations concerning their experiences of trauma.  This study examined the types of traumatic experiences disclosed to youth by their friends, youth&apos;s experiences of supporting a friend following disclosure of trauma, youth&apos;s secondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions to their friends&apos; disclosures, and potential risk factors for the development of STS.  The validity of an adult measure of STS, the Secondary Trauma Scale, with an adolescent population was also explored.  Utilizing qualitative and quantitative research methods, 60 youth (ages 11-16) participated in a semi-structured interview and completed questionnaires.  Results suggest the preliminary validity of the Secondary Trauma Scale for use with adolescents.  Additionally, increased levels of positive and negative affect were associated with increased levels of STS and general traumatic distress.  Furthermore, females reported more general posttraumatic symptomatology than males, while youth indirectly exposed to a friend&apos;s interpersonal trauma reported more symptoms of STS compared to youth indirectly exposed to a friend&apos;s noninterpersonal trauma.  Implications for the development of programs to educate youth about peer helping and self-care strategies are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the relationship between gender socialization, assessed by the  gender ideologies  of inauthenticity in relationships and body objectification (Tolman &amp; Porche, 2000), and overt and relational aggression and peer victimization among 212 girls in five Denver, Colorado public middle schools.  A feminist developmental perspective was used to 1) examine whether internalized norms of femininity were related to overt and relational aggression and peer victimization; 2) evaluate whether girls used certain types of aggressive behavior to adhere to, or reject, norms of femininity; and 3) assess whether girls who were victimized were more likely than other girls to internalize such norms. Findings from structural equation modeling analyses revealed little empirical support for the hypothesized relationships between norms of femininity and girls&apos; aggressive behavior. A significant relationship, however, was found between inauthentic self in relationships with others and peer victimization. This finding indicated that girls who were more likely to be inauthentic in their relationships with others had higher rates of peer victimization than other girls. Implications of these findings for developmental theory, research, and social work practice are delineated.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>THE SPECTACLE OF NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS: THE CHAD-CAMEROON PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND EXPLOITATION IN THE NIGER DELTA AND THE CHAD BASIN</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In recent years, neoclassical economic literature has undergone a fundamental change of emphasis, from orthodox neoclassical to neoinstitutional theory.  World Bank research and high-level policy departments have reflected this change by shifting from development as `structural adjustment&apos; to development as `governance&apos;.  I engage the case of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development Project (CCPDP) to argue that the neoclassical economic shift is a spectacle or exhibit, irrelevant in important ways to exploitation &quot;on the ground.&quot;  Contrary to neoclassical economics and World Bank development rationales, the CCPDP is a hyper-documented project with a hyper-restricted scope, typical of commodity exploitation in Central Africa and elsewhere.  I use the case of key commodity exploitation over the last 600 years in Nigeria to show parallels with the CCPDP.  First, I show the use of exhibits, spectacular violence and quotidian control in exploitation of Nigeria from slave trade with dynastic canoe houses through petroleum production at the time of nominal independence.  Second, Watts&apos; examination of petroleum exploitation through the lens of the oil complex and the petro-state provides detailed analysis of the &quot;ungovernable governmentality&quot; that characterizes such exploitation in Nigeria and in the larger &quot;oil complex.&quot;  Thirdly, I examine writing on CSR as well as evidence that political instability can be a competitive advantage.  This undercuts the important neoclassical economic development notion that business simply &quot;does business&quot; while government and civil society are responsible for human welfare.  In my conclusion I offer provisional areas where the project points to further research.  These include the importance of interdisciplinary regional focus on the Chad basin and the Gulf of Guinea, including the value of business literature; ways of effectively examining social movement pressure and corporate response; and the implications of designing a project around governmentality and relational power for studies of hegemony, power and development.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examines central aspects of the ancestral tradition of the Gamei of Ghana which have not previously been investigated systematically from a psychological perspective. It is argued that Carl Gustav Jung and his intellectual descendants are the only Western psychological thinkers who have come close to formulating a conceptual framework that is helpful in this context, because Africa featured prominently in Jung&apos;s formulations of his influential psychological theories during his archetypal journey to Africa. Accordingly, core features of Jungian theory are examined in order to determine the extent to which a psychological investigation of Gamei cosmological perspectives, particularly perspectives on death and spirits, can enrich our understanding of traditional Ghanaian cultural practices. By the same token, the limits of Jungian theory are also explored, along with an identification of the ways in which Jungian theory can, conversely, be enriched by the application of traditional Ghanaian cosmological frameworks.Gamei concepts of death and funeral rituals, widowhood rites and the ancestral world are examined in considerable depth, and it is argued that the Jungian concept of the collective unconscious is considerably similar, conceptually, to the ancestral world of the Gamei as experienced in traditional Ghanaian culture. However, it is also pointed out that in Jungian theory, individuation is the goal of life, while ancestorship is the ultimate goal of life for the Gamei and other African peoples. A formulation is offered that expands Jung&apos;s theory to include a final developmental stage, the attainment of ancestorship. It is argued that including an elucidation of the widespread experiences of ancestorship and community among indigenous peoples has the potential to enrich the current scope of psychological theory. In this re-formulation, drawing from observations in Ghanaian and other indigenous African cultures, a meaningful psychology reflects universal spiritual phenomena that encompass the individuation process, ancestorship and community as an integral whole.In the final chapter, the core arguments of the various chapters are re-captured, concluding with a summary of the salient contributions of the dissertation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Quality of Life (QOL) in Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) patients after Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) neurosurgery generally improves between 3 to 24 months post-operatively. However, QOL beyond 2 year follow-up is generally unknown. This study examined the QOL in 16 advanced PD patients who received DBS at an average of 7.5 year follow-up with the Parkinson&apos;s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Participants had an average Disease Duration of 20.57 years (SD 5.7) and a mean Age of 63.50 (SD 8.05). Linear regression analyses suggested a constellation of changes involving Time, Age, and Disease Duration. As Time progressed since DBS intervention, the PDQ-39 Cognitions subscale worsened (p &lt; .05). Increasing Age was associated with improvement in Stigma-related QOL (p &lt; .01). Rising Disease Duration correlated with improvements in three PDQ-39 subscales: (a) Stigma (p &lt; .01), (b) Emotional Well-Being (p &lt; .01), and (c) Social Support (p &lt; .05). Findings suggested the need to further explore the domains and dimensions of QOL change post-DBS intervention, as well as other methods to measure the depth and breadth of QOL in DBS recipients.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Although a significant amount of research has accounted for gender from a social constructionist perspective, research specifically examining the construction of masculinity is still a relatively new endeavor.  Additionally, although gender is accounted for in various family communication theories, no theory specifically accounts for gender formation within the context of family interaction.   The purpose of this study is to examine sons&apos; narratives of their recollections of father-son interactions.  Studying the father-son dyad in this way may help us to better understand how men constitute masculinity in particular familial relationships.  Although the purpose was to examine the themes of father-son interactions, the themes of masculinity are also salient.  Therefore, this study also illuminates common masculine themes as reported in men&apos;s stories of their fathers.  Twenty-one men (age 18 or older) participated in semi-structured interviews that lasted 45-55 minutes.  Qualitative data yielded 3 major themes and 26 sub-themes surrounding father-son interaction, as it pertains to men&apos;s ideas about masculinity.  Discussion of 4 major findings and 3 secondary findings are presented.  Finally, strengths and limitations of the study are explored and directions for future research are suggested.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study opens the door for a re-thinking of how discourse shapes AmericanIndian representation and identity. As such, contemporary American Indian artist, VirgilOrtiz, his art, and the discourse surrounding both art and artist are examined to reveal thestrategies and tactics employed in his constitution of a politics of representation thatbroaden the spectrum of considerations of American Indian identity.Critical invention is the orientation through which two methodologicalapproaches are intertextually applied. A critical rhetorical approach is employed toanalyze both the vernacular discourse produced by Ortiz and the dominant discourseconstructed by the dominant culture. Sorrells (1999) theoretical and methodologicalapproach to reading intercultural imagery is also applied to conduct a visual analysis ofOrtiz&apos;s art.To contextually frame an understanding of Ortiz and his work, a literature reviewand a historical chapter are included. The literature review details the linking ofAmerican Indian cultural identity, collective identity, and cultural sovereignty to theproduction of American Indian art; examines art and American Indian identity; andinvestigates art and the production of a politics of representation. The historical chapterreveals the poetics and politics of American Indian discursive constructions by both thedominant culture and American Indians.The theme of sadomasochistic dominance and submission (SMDS) is explored inOrtiz&apos;s art to understand how it communicatively operates through vernacular discourse.Ortiz&apos;s marketing through branding and personal branding is analyzed to understand howOrtiz both subverts and complies with the dominant culture&apos;s current entrenchment incommodity capitalism and in stale American Indian representations.The measure of representational sovereignty that Ortiz asserts is evident in themediums and the media in which he participates. This study reveals that Ortiz produces acounter discourse that disturbs hegemonic notions of American Indians; promotes moreprismatic considerations of American Indian identity, rather than one-dimensional stalestereotypes or two-dimensional restraining binaries; and offers alternative AmericanIndian archetypes for consideration. Ortiz draws from the mainstream to the margins andthe surface to the subterranean to create a politics of representation that promotes anunderstanding of multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, and multiple American Indian identityarticulations, which move American Indians closer to signification self-sovereignty.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>What Matters Most? Measuring Service Quality to Improve Schools</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Over the recent years an observable trend has emerged in the field of education. Parents are empowered and encouraged to make school choice decisions for their children and have become consumers of the educational delivery system.  They are inundated information regarding the product of the school - student achievement scores and overall performance rankings. Do parents value other things beyond academic performance rankings and student achievement ratings? How do parents perceive the importance of the quality of the delivery of educational services?  In a competitive educational marketplace, attracting and retaining families is essential to a school&apos;s ability to survive and succeed.This mixed-method study draws from research on customer service from the business field.  It was designed to learn more about parental perceptions of the service quality dimensions: Reliability, Assurance, Tangibles, Empathy, and Responsiveness (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Barry, 1985).   In schools, these dimensions correspond to issues of school safety, culture and climate of the learning environment, communication and parental involvement.  Parents from four elementary schools in a large urban school district participated in this study by completing a survey designed to solicit information about parental perceptions of the importance and performance of these service quality dimensions in relation to their experiences with their child&apos;s school.  Interviews with the school principals before and after survey administration identified their current practices and perceptions regarding parental feedback and evaluated their school&apos;s survey results as a tool to identify areas for school improvement.The findings of this study indicate that parents of all socioeconomic levels and ethnicities consider Assurance (the knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to inspire trust and confidence) and Empathy (the school&apos;s ability to provide caring and individualized attention) as being more important to them than school performance indicators specifically related to student achievement. In most instances, parents&apos; ratings of the importance of a service quality indicator were higher than their ratings of their school&apos;s performance on that indicator. These findings suggest that school leaders should balance their efforts toward improving student achievement with efforts toward improving customer service.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Why Two Swords Were Enough: Israelite Tradition History Behind Luke 22:35-38</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Jesus&apos; charge in Luke 22:35-38 that his apostles should buy swords is one of the most enigmatic texts in the gospels. Although previous studies made use of a wide range of standard critical methods, none of these approaches satisfactorily revealed the pericope&apos;s meaning. In a fresh re-examination of Luke&apos;s sword-logion this project interweaves biblical and cultural intertextuality and asserts that the sword-logion is a Lukan literary foil that repudiates a well-known hagiographic tale. The provenance for this legendary saga (i.e., the &quot;two-sword&quot; traditum) was Gen 34 whose routine refraction in later Jewish writings led to its inclusion as part of the broader cultural milieu of the first century C.E. Based on that premise I argue that Luke 22:35-38 was Luke&apos;s censure of a minor, but familiar HB tradition that informed and shaped the identity of Luke&apos;s community. While this project employs an eclectic mix of standard historical critical methods, tradition and literary criticism serve as the two principal methodological strategies.Chapter two examines the provenance of the &quot;two-sword&quot; traditum and identifies four motifs: family identity and honor; vindication of an honored one; national identity and honor; and justified vengeance. Using the story&apos;s main protagonists and these four motifs, the tradition&apos;s reappearance and subsequent development in the HB is tracked. Chapter three traces the refraction of the &quot;two-sword&quot; traditum in extracanonical writings. Particular attention is given to the amplifications of the tradition as it is retold and rewritten in Jewish writings of the Second Temple Period. After establishing that Luke routinely made use of oblique allusions and that he and his community knew Israel&apos;s scriptures and traditions, chapter four analyzes Luke 22:35-38 in light of that celebrated tradition. In the exegesis I argue that Luke exploits the &quot;two-sword&quot; traditum in order to exhort his community to reject a renowned HB tradition from their shared narrative universe. A hypothetical reading of the gospel illustrates how Luke attempted to persuade his readers to renounce the &quot;two-sword&quot; traditum and pursue peace instead of violence. Chapter five reviews the project and assesses its significance for future research.</dc:description>
