  <dc:description>Author: Heidi Rolander-PetersonTitle: Chasing the Buffalo off of Main Street:The Evaluation of Economic Vitality in Rural High Plains TownsAdvisor: Dr. Andrew GoetzDegree Date: June 2008ABSTRACTThis study is an examination of how prolific the transformation of therural small town (population between 1000 and 5000 persons) and Main Streethas been since 1950. The study uses established criteria including population,density, age, and downtown vacancy to examine the vitality of the ruraldowntown. The research is divided into several components including acomprehensive literature review of the data and analysis recorded by writers andscholars over the last one hundred years. Encompassed in the literature review isdescription of what elements of commerce, infrastructure, buildings and businesscompose the small town downtown followed by data collected for an originalindex of vitality. The study sought to determine the relationship between thevitality of the downtown business core and the implementation of economicdevelopment plans and concluded that based on the data collected and statisticalanalysis of that data that a definitive conclusion could not be reached.The study did reveal that population loss on the high plains on the UnitedStates is more prevalent in the hinterlands than in small towns themselves. It canalso be concluded that in addition to the data collected town assets, human capital,economic development plans, entrepreneurship, and human capital may impactthe vitality of rural Main Street.DPDoFcumentsCompleteClick Here &amp; UpgradeExpanded FeaturesUnlimited Pages</dc:description>

  <dc:description>I conducted research at three educational sites, a private learning center and two sites in a Denver Public middle school, to attempt to investigate what combination of curriculum, teaching methods, and expectations lead to the formation of a classroom culture that enables students to become self-motivated learners.  My theoretical base drew heavily upon social scientists who researched communication, student alienation, and political minority student success and failure.  I found that the teachers who actively created a successful classroom culture were conscious of their verbal and non-verbal communication styles and methods, were highly cognizant of the dynamics involved in the student-teacher relationship, and helped the students to believe in themselves and develop a long-term perspective.  The teachers who did not enable students to become self-motivated learners practiced a teaching philosophy that I termed debilitating sympathy, through which they focused on the students&apos; immediate present and ultimately perpetuated an oppressive education system.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The following work is a look into the history and value of the composite index of leading indicators. Current and past business cycle theory is explored to demonstrate the relevance of a tool like the composite index of leading indicators. An argument that business cycle theory has not proven sufficient in explaining changes in the direction of the economy is made. The notion that the composite leading index has a proven track record of successfully predicting movements in the economy is reviewed. The conclusion becomes the idea that since theory and its forecasting counterparts have not proven a reliable method to predict movements in the economy, a tool like the composite leading index is valuable.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The history of the islands of Cape Verde has created a creole language (Crioulo) and people strongly tied to their complex linguistic identities.  The presence of Portuguese as an official language throughout this history has created complex and contradictory identity associations among its inhabitants.  These identities have always been contingent upon the presence of an external factor which initiates the association, and often contradiction, in individuals dependent upon how they wish to be perceived.  The two languages in Cape Verde carry with them extensive connotations of socio-economic, political, and racial status, and the Cape Verdeans often move between groups as they perform their cultural identity.  The presence of an outsider (the author) who is also a missionary, adds significantly to these contradictions as identities are constructed and shaped dependent upon the identity (and perceived identity) of that external presence.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Cowboy Ride
A Video Documentary of the Threats to Livelihood
Ranchers Face in Southeastern WyomingAn Abstract of a Thesis 
Presented to the Faculty of Social Sciences
Mass Communications and Journalism Studies
University of DenverIn Partial Fulfillment of the requirements 
For the degree of
Master of ArtsBy Rachel Monserrate
May 2008Ranching in southeastern Wyoming is facing critical threats from lawsuits regarding environmental issues. But what are the reasons that these lawsuits are filed, and what is the price that ranchers - and the legacy of ranching in the American West - will pay? Cowboy Ride provides a personal, first-person account of growing up on ranches and addresses what ranchers stand to lose if environmental groups file successful lawsuits against them. This film also examines a specific lawsuit challenging the grazing permits allotted on the Pole Mountain area of the Medicine Bow National Forest.To inform this topic, I examined prior instances of private property, eminent domain, and the challenges that ranchers face in trying to maintain their livelihoods. Through production challenges, my proposed project changed dramatically from an examination of a specific lawsuit to an account of what ranching means to me, how a lawsuit can threaten livelihoods, and what hope exists for ranching in the future.While Cowboy Ride may have raised more questions about the future of ranching than I was ultimately able to answer, the film serves to explore the fight over the West and the costs incurred along the way. This examination provides for future students an explanation of the challenges that documentary filmmaking presents and will encourage them to embrace the process and allow the story to tell itself.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>What is an effective counterterrorism strategy?  Using the case of the conflict in Northern Ireland and the case of the conflict between Israel and Palestine, this project tests the arguments of Paul Wilkinson and Peter Sederberg, concerning approaches to the threat of terrorism, in order to determine whether coercion, conciliation, or some combination of the two most effectively responds to the threat of terrorism.  As the Northern Ireland case shows, a balanced approach that includes good security policy and addressing the economic, social, and/or legal issues that lie at the root of the conflict out of which the use of terrorism evolved will address security and defense issues, and the underlying motivations of the terrorist organizations.  It serves to defend the state, undermine popular support because grievances are being addressed, ease the co-optation of terrorist organizations (if possible), and improve chances for success of negotiations.  Coercive and conciliatory approaches each have their place, but neither can stand alone.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Throughout American history, memorials have played a key role in shaping  collective memory and propagating particular beliefs and conceptions of public tragedy. With the rise of an online participatory culture, collective memory can be shaped by a plurality of voices, rather than by those with powerful positions in government and other large organizations, which typically control the process of memorialization.  Social media connects communities through technology and has allowed the public to create spaces for mourning and memorialization without the input of official culture.  The digital memorials that arise out of media environments contribute to and change the collective memory of American public tragedy.  This study centers around three forms of digital memorials: video memorials, mourning on social networking sites, and memorials in virtual worlds.Through analysis of specific digital memorial sites, commentary from digital memorial media producers and a historical analysis of traditional memorial sites and spontaneous shrine sites this thesis examines how these memorials function as activist media not only in relation to issues surrounding public tragedy, but also by shaping collective memory.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The goal of this research is to design and build a more life-like prosthesis with a higher degree of freedom than currently available prosthetic devices. Direct brain monitoring of the motor cortices was selected as a control mechanism that would provide more versatility than the myoelectric sensors used in most commercially available prostheses. Near-infrared imaging was tested to determine its potential for use in a feedforward/feedback, neural-fuzzy logic training network, which would utilize electromyography as the feedback element. To minimize power requirements as well as risk to the wearer of the imaging device, light emitting diodes were used as the source of near-infrared light. Initial tests indicate agreement between the near-infrared and magnetoencephalography data collected during similar activities. However, developing a light transmission system to negate the requirement of shaving the subject&apos;s head to use the near-infrared imaging device, resulted in poor signal strength due to the combination of light emitting diodes and plastic fiber optics and has ultimately lead us to reconsider the use of near-infrared for real-time monitoring of the brain. The effectiveness of functional near-infrared imaging for real-time control of a prosthetic limb and the associated limitations of this imaging technology are discussed as well as a method for mapping brain activity to muscle control and the results of using electromyography for monitoring muscle activation.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Riparian zones in the western United States are threatened by invasive species and increasingly, land management strategies include ecological restoration. Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) is a riparian invader with a flexible germination scheme and the ability to fix nitrogen through actinorhizal symbiosis. Two literature reviews, one addressing E. angustifolia and another addressing evapotranspiration in western riparian lands provide background on riparian ecology.  The foci of this thesis are two field projects to address the effect E. angustifolia and subsequent restoration has on riparian ecology. A multi-site vegetation survey after E. angustifolia removal relates site attributes (predictor variables) to restoration success, which was quantified by vegetation measurements (response variables). Regression tree modeling was used to analyze the data; these models indicate that edaphic and hydrologic variables explain the most variability in restoration success. A biogeochemical study of one of the 22 sites used in the first study quantified monthly soil inorganic nitrogen and moisture measurements in an E. angustifolia stand that subsequently underwent restoration (removal of invasive trees). This study indicates a sharp decrease in inorganic nitrogen concentrations after E. angustifolia removal. These studies are meant to inform land managers dealing with E. angustifolia invasion as well as encourage other researchers to address E. angustifolia in their work.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Nathan R. L. EilersTitle: HEMINGWAY AND BULLSHITAdvisor: Clark DavisDegree Date: November 2008ABSTRACTThis paper uses Harry Frankfurt&apos;s definition of bullshit as a lens to re-examine Ernest Hemingway&apos;s aesthetic of factual details and omission. Frankfurt argues that bullshit consists of speech made with indifference to its veracity, and one who makes a habit of bullshitting may lose touch with reality. By studying three works across the author&apos;s career, &quot;Big Two-Hearted River,&quot; &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,&quot; and The Old Man and the Sea, one sees that Hemingway&apos;s prose style evolves and eventually contradicts his artistic statements. Given the fact that he promotes his aesthetic while discarding it, his theory becomes bullshit. Because normative critical interpretation of the author rests largely on his aesthetic theory, it too is inaccurate. Though Hemingway misrepresents how he writes, the success of his work regardless of aesthetics demonstrates that his writing is more complex than many think and deserves a more thorough re-evaluation.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Influence of a highly interactive species upon bird diversity within a gradient of urbanization</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Urbanization and subsequent habitat fragmentation have significantly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Studies suggest that prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence bird species diversity, abundance, and richness. Past research was conducted on native prairie and few studies investigated whether this relationship exists in an urban/suburban setting. The landscape changes that reduced the prairie dog&apos;s range also impact bird species directly, resulting in habitat loss and isolation. I performed bird counts on 20 habitat fragments stratified along an urban gradient in the Denver metropolitan area to examine the influence of fragment area, isolation, and distance from city center on bird diversity measures. I used 12 fragments (six colonized by prairie dogs, six uncolonized by prairie dogs) in a paired study to determine whether the presence of prairie dogs influences bird diversity measures in an urban setting. Diversity measures were generally higher on colonized fragments for every season except winter; however, these trends were not statistically significant. Diversity measures for the paired study increased significantly with increasing area and increasing isolation. When I analyzed all 20 habitat fragments, I found that larger fragment area and fragments further from the city center exhibited significantly higher diversity measures in univariate models. I found that diversity measures were significantly higher on fragments that were older, larger, and had higher forb cover in multivariate models. Future biodiversity studies along the urban gradient in Denver should include an analysis of the matrix adjacent to habitat fragments and should employ better indices for estimating urbanization. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as highly interactive species in urban systems should also include an analysis of other taxa.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Several recent studies have revealed that there is increasing individualism and declining interest in politics and civic engagement among college students. Accordingly, many scholars called for reinvigorating the civic mission of higher education. This thesis study examines academic service-learning as an effective pedagogy for promoting students’ civic engagement. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the best ways of integrating service-learning into the curricula of undergraduate students. Using McCarthy’s (2003) conceptual framework, the “Concept of Triangles,” this study provides a comprehensive review of literature on the theoretical underpinnings, partners, and relationships of academic service-learning. The results of the study suggest that establishing clear connections between course content and the kind of service students do, and making meaningful placements of students to service sites are necessary for establishing effective
service-learning courses. Additionally, the findings of the study reveal that promoting critical reflection, encouraging active participation from all partners, and meeting real community needs are essential to the success of service-learning programs. Finally, the findings of this study indicate that effective campus/community partnerships are characterized by reciprocal, collaborative, democratic, caring, trusting, and respectful relationships.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>We have investigated and characterized the interactions of &lt;em&gt;E. coliform&lt;/em&gt; bacterial cells with polymeric surfaces by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.  Using chemical modifications to the surface of polystyrene-based polymers, we were able to characterize and compare the chemical changes taking place in the region approximately 600 to 1000 nanometers from the surface of the device.  Statistical analysis performed on the spectral region from 1800 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 800 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; allowed us to identify biochemical changes in this region of the IR spectrum that suggest that polymer architecture and to a lesser degree, chemical structure, is responsible for differences between how bacterial cells were interacting with our polymers.  Further investigations using scanning electron microscopy, direct bacterial culture analysis in moving and static media, ATR-FTIR microscopy, and multivariate analysis were able to collectively confirm that polymer morphology played a greater role in introducing variability into the process of adhesive interaction with E. coli bacteria than did the chemical makeup of the adherent surface.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis examines the connection between Islamic religious educationand terrorism. It looks at the curricula of the Azherite religious schools in Egypt.It examines how the curricula view the three themes of Jihad which are offensiveJihad, defensive Jihad, and Jihad for the purification of the soul in addition to therelations of Muslims with non-Muslims. Books which are used by violent jihadistgroups for membership acquisition and cadre training are also studied for Jihadthemes and relations with non-Muslims.The analysis shows that the curricula are, generally speaking, a peaceful onein its principal direction, since it obviously calls for defensive Jihad and notoffensive Jihad. Often, it deals with important concepts of Jihad within theconfines of such subjects as the Jihad for the purification of the soul [the GreaterJihad]. Some textbooks included lessons on &quot;Peace in Islam&quot; and advocated thefact that peace is the origin in Islamic Shari&apos;a and war is the exception and it isfought only for defensive reasons. This orientation in the curricula very muchcoincides with the themes of conflict resolution The comparison between theAzherite schools&apos; textbooks and the books used by violent jihadist groups formembership acquisition and cadre training shows that they are in total contrast inrelation to how they view the topic of Jihad and relationship with non-Muslims.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Islamic saint veneration is not generally known outside of the Islamic world, and is rarely discussed in textbooks on Islam.  Practices of Islamic saint veneration can vary by region, and there is little English-language information on Islamic saint veneration as it is practiced in Iran.  The most distinctive characteristic of saint veneration in modern Iran is the presence of and pilgrimage to thousands of Imam-zadeh shrines - shrines dedicated to the numerous descendants of the twelve Shi&apos;ite Imams.  Through an examination of Islamic saint veneration, the religious history of Iran, current Municipality of Tehran data on shrines near Tehran, the anthropological work of Anne Bettridge on shrine culture in the city of Shiraz, and a modern Shi&apos;ite pilgrimage guide, this thesis seeks to situate the practice of Islamic saint veneration in modern Iran.  As will be demonstrated herein, the prevalence of Imam-zadeh shrines in modern Iran is due to religious reforms instituted during the Safavid era in Iranian history (1501-1736 C.E.), when the mostly-Sunni population was converted to Twelver Shi&apos;ism.  During the conversion process, the already-extant practices of saint veneration in Iran were reformed from the local panoply they had been and promoted in the particularly Twelver-Shi&apos;ite image of Imam and Imam-zadeh veneration - as a means of reinforcing and validating imperial control, and as means of popularizing Shi&apos;ite beliefs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&quot;Who is Emily Dickinson?&quot; is the primary question I confront in my thesis.  The question is difficult, given Dickinson&apos;s inventive juxtapositions, mental suppleness, atypical grammar, odd diction, and curious metaphors; even her very best critics have struggled to cage her immense cognitive creativity.  After reading all the works of the leading scholars in Dickinson studies, as well as those of her minor critics, I determined that the best approach I could take toward understanding Dickinson and her work was my own - a unique, individual approach.  Seeking an appropriate metaphor or symbol that would help me comprehend her poetry, I determined that the (multifarious) image of an angel, as a symbolic &quot;form&quot; that mediates between the spiritual and physical world just as Dickinson did as a poet, was the best figure through which I could read and interpret her life&apos;s work.  In doing this, my largest discovery was evidence that every investigation we undertake into a &quot;subject&quot; is really an investigation into our own mind.  While we presume to begin at &quot;the beginning&quot; of our subject, we are really only at the beginning of ourselves, standing in our largest blind spot.  Thus, my study was entirely about &quot;me.&quot;  While believing I was wrestling with Dickinson, I was actually wrestling with my own angel, my adversary, my &quot;self,&quot; while her process escaped me.  In a sense, Dickinson serves as an angel to me for the duration of my thesis, and, in the end, I release her back into the heavens to become a muse for someone else.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper analyzes the empirical events of capital market liberalization in Russia and refers to the procedure of capital market liberalization described in theory as a benchmark to assess the magnitude of events shaping the capital market liberalization in Russia.The reformers of Russian regime change did not take a gradual approach of adjustments toward a successful socioeconomic transition. The state failed to create market-supporting institutions and instead rather proceeded with an ambitious program of synchronized application of policy changes and the economic liberalization. Lack of market-supporting institutions and an underdeveloped legal system in Russia have been the key tools through which politically well-connected managers and politicians themselves seized the opportunity and established ownership of former state-owned enterprises. Russian privatization did not provide efficiency incentives to produce new wealth, rather is has redistributed the already existing wealth through dubious methods.Clearly, the ultimate goal of capital liberalization in Russia was not to disperse ownership of former state-owned enterprises among the people of Russia, but to create a powerful support group that would ensure the second mandate of President Yeltsin&apos;s administration. The class of newborn `oligarchs&apos; in Russia became the ruling minority that was not interested in creating value; rather, they were interested in stealing the value that has already existed. Weak and vaguely defined laws as opposed to explicit legal foundations and the ability to enforce contracts at proper institutions make an enormous difference in development of capital markets.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Joshua Q StoweTitle: Material property predictions of polymers using molecular dynamics simulationsAdvisors: Dr. Maciej Kumosa and Dr. Peter LazDegree Date: June 2008ABSTRACTNanoscale materials can exhibit different physical properties compared to their macroscale counterparts.  The use of multiscale modeling of materials has been recognized as a tool to predict both physical and chemical properties of materials between the nanoscale and macroscale.  Thus, the primary goal of this research was to utilize molecular dynamics, one of the multiscale modeling techniques, to predict of the mechanical behavior of polyethylene.Stress-strain relationships and the Young&apos;s modulus were calculated for low density polyethylene at several molecular weights and high density polyethylene models at a single molecular weight.  Probabilistic Monte Carlo methods were used in order to identify possible sources of uncertainty in the mechanical property predictions.Probabilistic methods identified the effects of uncertainty on mechanical property predictions.  Significant variability, on the order of 1000% of the mean, in stress-strain relationships and the Young&apos;s modulus predictions were caused by variations in polymer configuration and density, the non-unique nature of molecular dynamic calculations of equilibrium, and the molecular weight of the model used for analysis.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper presents a comprehensive metric analysis of Bach&apos;s Brandenburg Concertos, with particular emphasis on the issues of metric conflict. The analytic methodology is based on the work of Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, while the analytic notation used is based partly on that of Lerdahl and Jackendoff and partly on that of Jonathan Kramer, with some original modifications.The paper discusses the factors generating metric conflict, along with its distribution, correlation with other structural parameters, and functional effects. The relationship between metric conflict and fluctuations in the depth of metric hierarchy is examined in detail. Some cases of metric displacement and metric irregularity are examined, when they form part of the context for particular episodes of conflict.The conclusion argues for an approach to interpreting this and similar repertoires that leaves room for the emergence in performance of the independent metric organization of different parts, as an integral part of the ebb and flow of musical tension.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The increasing emergence of new antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and the 
weaponization of normally rare bacterial strains pose a potential threat of pandemic disease.  
Recognition of this threat has invigorated efforts to address prevention (quarantine, vaccination) and cure (antibiotics) of these diseases, as well as the study of the complex interaction between host, pathogen, and environmental factors that impact the progression and severity of the disease. The genomic revolution and the advent of reverse vaccinology promise a rapid response to infectious diseases, but many of these infectious agents are difficult or impossible to grow in vitro (e.g., HCV, Whipple disease).  Moreover, an understanding of the pathogen itself and an understanding of host-pathogen interactions should lead to new therapies and even cures. We hypothesize that by exploiting the advances in micro fluidics and materials engineering, we can create a device to rapidly and simultaneously investigate a myriad of culture conditions necessary for successful cultivation
of target organisms.To achieve these goals this work designed, constructed, and tested a 3-D micro liter incubator array prototype system, ready for large scale injection molding manufacturing, which also employs diffusion bonding to affix the multi laminae structure. The device was utilized to impart variable stress conditions on wild-type yeast (PRE1PRE2).  Results were measured through techniques suitable for coupling the device to a high-throughput plate reader.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This ethnography seeks to call into question what it means to be an Irish traditional musician in Denver, Colorado at the beginning of the 21st century.  To unpack the various musical pathways navigated in this community, the author conducted participant-observation at pub sessions, in-depth interviews, and informal interviews over a period of two years.  Individual&apos;s musical choices become especially important in such multireferential urban soundscapes - manifesting useful new nuances for the literature on identity and music.  Denver pub settings, removed from Ireland in time and space and connected to other local and global soundscapes, engage complex concepts of hybridity in tradition, authenticity, performance, and identity.  As musicians navigate their numerous identities, as well as those that become possible and imaginable through &quot;scapes,&quot; they resituate themselves in multiple and meaningful ways, playing out not only their own identities but also adding to the repertoire of possible identities in the process.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis seeks to explain why the Department of Homeland Security had difficulty fulfilling its roles when it was formed, specifically its role as grant administrator.  Role theory surmises that conflict arises from unclear expectations, conflicting expectations, and too many roles.  This study utilized various public testimonies, legislation, and other government documents to examine how the missions of the twenty-two agencies that were merged together to make up DHS changed.  Even though DHS has changed continually over the five years since its existence most employees seem to be clear on the mission of the organization in which they work.  However, there is still a considerable amount of conflict resulting from the agencies being forced together in such a frankensteinian way.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Situated in the heart of Colorado is a unique and beautiful environmental oasis historically referred to as the Palmer Divide.  Untold quantities of prehistoric artifacts have been collected from this region by private landowners.  Possibly forever lost to scientific study, these artifacts would have allowed archaeologists to have a more comprehensive understanding of the prehistory of Colorado because as it now stands, there is a large geographical void not considered into existing hypotheses.  Documentation and analysis of a small portion of these privately held artifacts conducted for this thesis research indicates that, contrary to current hypotheses, the Palmer Divide was continuously utilized by a diverse range of cultural groups throughout prehistory.  This research also demonstrates that cultural traditions believed to have been restricted to distinct environmental regions exploited a larger geographical area.  Repetitive exploitation of and visitation to the Palmer Divide made this a vital and significant place for prehistoric populations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>On-road remote sensors measure the car exhaust and report its emissions in real time. Three projects surrounding the performance and calibration of FEAT (Fuel Efficiency Automobile Test) and RSD (Remote Sensing Detector) units were undertaken. Currently, Colorado is conducting a program in which gross emitters are identified by the RSD 4600. An analysis of the RSD 4600 and FEAT instruments&apos; noise was performed to verify that instrument noise did not affect the reported emissions. The RSD 4600 showed less instrument noise than the FEAT instruments, except for the NO channel.Secondly, an innovative method was developed to make a 1:1 CO:CO2 gas ratio and 0.1 HC/CO2¬ gas ratio. This is advantageous because one of the three gas cylinders used in on-road calibration can be eliminated. Transporting gas cylinders and having them on site is expensive and inconvenient, especially in foreign countries.Finally, an on-road study of vehicle emissions was conducted in March of 2008 in San Jose, Fresno, and L.A., California. This is the first time that NH3, SO2 and NO2 were measured by on-road remote sensors. The results of the analysis of ammonia emissions from light duty vehicles are presented here.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF LEAF EPIDERMAL CHARACTERS TO DELIMIT GENERIC BOUNDARIES WITHIN THE SYZYGIUM ALLIANCE (MYRTACEAE)</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Syzygium alliance (Myrtaceae) is a group of genera consisting of Acmena, Acmenosperma, Waterhousea, Cleistocalyx, Piliocalyx and Syzygium s.s.  They collectively number over 1200 species, most of which have been placed in Syzygium s.s.  It has long been disputed as to whether these genera should all be lumped into Syzygium s.l. or kept separate.I undertook an analysis of leaf cuticles to search for set of leaf epidermal surface characters that would distinguish each genus.  I measured or noted all apparent surface characters on the cuticles and compiled a detailed list of the epidermal characters of each of the studied species. A consistency study showed excessive variation in the measured characters within some species, which weakened the analyses, but some trends were still apparent.  
I ran a principle components analysis to collapse correlated data and then three Multiple Discriminant Analyses.  One analysis focused on the entire group of samples, one on groups recognized by Hyland, and one on groups recognized by Craven et al.  The MDA of the overall data set and of Hyland&apos;s groups both showed good separation of Acmena, Acmenosperma, and Waterhousea.  All three MDAs showed strong overlap of Syzygium and Eugenia, which indicates that leaf epidermal characters by themselves are unable to distinguish between these two genera.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This paper describes a three-level toolkit - The Investment Sustainability Toolkit.  The Toolkit assists firms in improving the efficacy of one segment of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by creating at the first level, a strategy of conflict prevention.  This strategy is followed by Common Elements of Conflict that Resolves/Becomes Violent, and Key Areas for Stabilization as Level II.  The third and final level of the toolkit describes specific initiatives for increasing success, through The Screening Checklist.The paper assesses through case study, the efforts of Firestone, Inc. in Liberia regarding regional development, stabilization, and economic development.  This is done through the lens of the 3-levels of The Toolkit and for the purposes of illustrating lost opportunities that a Toolkit framework would have identified by linking the success of all stakeholders.  Losses That Look Like Wins are a key focus area within the case study as are times of stability that offer the opportunity to create institutions - civil, political, economic - to perpetuate that stability.This paper makes the case for corporations as social change agents, for preceding violence, and for including a strategy, and a framework, as well as targeted initiatives to increase the success and efficacy of this segment of CSR.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Reader Response to Product Placement in Women&apos;s Magazines</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Product placement in women&apos;s magazines is an unexplored area of research. This thesis project seeks to understand how readers of women&apos;s magazines respond to product placement in Cosmopolitan and O, The Oprah Magazine. To conduct this project, two types of analysis were used: ideological analysis and reception analysis. The ideological analysis was used in order to discover how women&apos;s magazines construct ideologies related to ideal femininity and how the product placement is framed within the ideologies. The reception analysis was essential in understanding how readers of women&apos;s magazines react to product placement, and, in turn, the ideal femininity ideologies framing the articles within the magazines. The reception analysis consisted of four focus groups, containing white female participants from 18- to 35-years-old: the ages that make up the target demographics for the two magazines. The groups were split up into two groups of 18- to 25-year-old white females and two groups of 26- to 35-year-old white females. Stuart Hall&apos;s theory of reader response was essential to interpreting the women&apos;s responses to the magazines.The ideologies discovered primarily revolved around ideal beauty and consumption as a way to obtain an ideal beauty and lifestyle. The ideological analysis also found that the magazines create ideal femininity identities for the readers to aspire to emulate: the Cosmo girl and O woman. The women in the focus groups were very aware of the ideal beauty ideology and generally opposed the content and the product placement when this ideology was present. When the ideology of consumption was the primary ideology present within an article, the women did not oppose the content. Consumption seems to be a natural and expected part of the women&apos;s magazine reading experience.Through application of Hall&apos;s reader response theory it was apparent that women read the articles and the product placement in different ways, thus showing that women&apos;s magazines&apos; readers can be active participants in reading and aren&apos;t always taking the information presented as the gospel; an idea that has been discussed time-and-again in research about the impact of women&apos;s magazines on their readers. The readings weren&apos;t relegated to dominant, negotiated, and oppositional either; instead the readings occurred on a continuum--dominant-negotiated, negotiated-oppositional, etc.--which challenges Hall, since his theory relies on three clear-cut styles of reading cultural texts. Also discussed in this thesis, in relation to Hall&apos;s reader response theory, is the concept of &quot;doings,&quot; or how the women physically take action on their readings of the text. Although it was not within the scope of this study to actually follow the women to track their doings, &quot;talking about doing&quot; was noted in the participants&apos; responses.Overall, this thesis project provides valuable insight not only into how product placement and the ideologies surrounding it influence women&apos;s magazines readers, but also into how women react to, respond to, and utilize the content in women&apos;s magazines.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Hypoglycemia is the state defined by lower than normal levels of glucose in the blood. During hypoglycemia, pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon to increase blood glucose and maintain glucose homeostasis. Currently, the mechanisms which initiate glucagon secretion are not well understood. This study investigates the role of melanocortins in regulating glucagon secretion.
	Insulin tolerance tests in mice lacking the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene showed a correlation between the melanocortin, α-MSH, and glucagon secretion in alpha cells (Hochgeschwender et al. 2003). Results of the current study indicate that the POMC product, melanocortin α-MSH, is acting through a melanocortin receptor at the surface of the alpha cells to trigger the release of glucagon. In order to define the function of pancreatic melanocortin receptors and their interactions with POMC, one must try to identify and characterize these receptors in relation to their physiological role in energy homeostasis, as well as focus on future therapeutic targets for treating hypoglycemia in diabetics. 
	Analysis through polymerase chain reaction, Quantitative PCR, as well as a combination of fluorescent techniques was used to investigate the receptor type, expression levels, and distribution of melanocortin receptors present in mouse pancreatic islets and a cultured alpha cell line. The melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 are known to be prevalent in the central nervous system where both play a role in energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine processes (Ellacott and Cone 2006). The receptor MC4 was found to be expressed in whole mouse islets as well as alpha cells.  However, the receptor MC3 does not appear in either islets or alpha cells. Therefore, this study concludes that α-MSH may act directly through MC4R to trigger glucagon secretion in alpha cells.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Dark Nights and Transformation: A Psychoanalytic Interpretation of John of the Cross</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In this thesis, I examine the benefit that John of the Cross&apos; spiritual path of divine union can have for modern religious seekers and the psychotherapeutic community. Whereas classical Freudian psychoanalysts tended to depict religion and mysticism as illusional wish fulfillment and regression to pre-Oedipal states of fusion, many contemporary psychoanalytic theories promote the positive role that religion can play in people&apos;s lives as a source of strength, meaning, and purpose. In order to examine one ancient path of spirituality, in this thesis I analyze the spiritual path of John of the Cross with contemporary theories of psychoanalysis to illuminate the psychological processes that may be operating within John&apos;s path. In this thesis I first describe the life of John of the Cross in his sixteenth-century, Spanish context, and then discuss his synthesis of the classical Christian three-fold stage theory of the spiritual journey with his transitional phases of purgation and detachment of the dark nights, which when completed, John maintains, leads to a union with God in likeness and participation. Next, I describe Obeyesekere&apos;s contemporary hermeneutical model of psychoanalysis with its concepts of regression, progression, and the symbolic remove. Then, I detail the philosophical and methodological insights of Parsons&apos; three schools of the psychoanalytic study of mysticism, and Browning&apos;s reconception of the field of religion and psychological studies as a critical hermeneutical enterprise. Finally, in this thesis I analyze John&apos;s path with Obeyesekere&apos;s, Parsons&apos; and Browning&apos;s theories, arguing that John&apos;s path constitutes a built in regression to archaic unconscious material in his dark nights and a resolution and transformation of that material through and in his numinous Catholic theological symbolic order; that John&apos;s depiction of the divine union is consistent with Parsons&apos; descriptions of primordial levels of consciousness in his transformational school; and that John&apos;s own life and personality were transformed during his own spiritual journey. Together with the theological validation of John&apos;s path by the Catholic Church and other theologians, I maintain that the convergences of John&apos;s spiritual path with all three psychoanalytic and hermeneutical theories validate John&apos;s system as a viable, dynamic, and orthodox Western Christian path of spirituality and mysticism. In the Conclusion, I then discuss the considerable benefit that John&apos;s path can have both for religious seekers in providing comfort and meaning for their experiences of severe existential and spiritual loss in the dark nights, as well as for the psychotherapeutic community in combating reductionistic models of human functioning and the conception of mere symptom maintenance as the goal of treatment. Recognizing the psychological processes that operate within John&apos;s path and conceiving of the dark nights as traditional, recognized stages of the spiritual journey that may achieve psychological and spiritual transformation in adherents can also benefit the clients of mental health professionals. This discussion of the theoretical considerations of the value of John&apos;s spiritual path for psychotherapeutic and academic psychology then naturally broadens the focus of this thesis to encompass basic questions and suggestions for future research regarding the dialogue between theology and psychology.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The importance of PTAs in today&apos;s global economic order is unmistakable, especially during the last fifteen years when their proliferation has dramatically accelerated and their scope and structure have radically changed.  However, the available theoretical framework (international trade theories) from which their developmental impact is assessed seems to be largely lagging behind.  Hence, there is a crucial need for more realistic assessments of their embedded developmental features because an increasing number of developing countries are perceiving these agreements as one of the key instruments to propel their long delayed economic development.  In this thesis, I strive to construct an alternative theoretical framework that can better adapt to current PTAs&apos; structures, allowing a more realistic assessment of their economic impact on developing countries.  By following this alternative approach, I comparatively assess the development drive of two of today&apos;s most important PTAs, namely NAFTA and ASEAN.  The main conclusion echoes an increasing literature that warns developing countries from engaging in &quot;reciprocal&quot; North-South PTAs, but at the same time, encourages them to pursue South-South integration, which can prove to be beneficial for their development.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Author: Larry Nesbitt Title: THE IMPACT OF INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS ON THE DIFFUSION OF ADJUSTABLE SPEED MOTORS Advisor: Dr. Yavuz Yasar Degree Date: June 2008  ABSTRACT   This paper examines the relationship of the diffusion of new technologies to industry level characteristics.  Specifically, adjustable speed motors, an energy saving technology of wide applicability across manufacturing industries, is the subject of this examination.  Industry characteristics, including average profits, average employment, mean value of shipments, business failure rate, average energy costs, and various employment levels are used to explain differing levels of the technology penetration in different manufacturing industries.  A panel dataset has been constructed to analyze the relationship between these various industry characteristics and technology penetration.  This dataset includes statistics from 1992, 1998, and 2002.  Three separate models for analyzing the data are employed.  These include the Constant Coefficients model and two variations of the Least Squared Dummy Variable Model.  These models suggest both average energy costs and mean profits have a positive relationship to technology penetration while failure rate appears to have a negative relationship.  The role of average firm size is ambiguous.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study investigated the differences and similarities between traditional network news and one example of nontraditional news: The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. There has been a significant amount of research written about the effects of watching nontraditional news as opposed to traditional news. This study looked at several key variables to determine exactly what differentiates these genres of news, and what researcher may have overlooked in terms of similarities these genres share. The results indicate that many variables that deal with entertainment value and educational value create differences between these genres of news. There are, however, significant findings that show how The Daily Show distinguishes itself from network news in ways that may not contribute to the entertainment value of the program, but instead create a new form of journalism that does not necessarily have to be objective to be credible.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Critique of Neoclassical Theory of Health Care Consumption</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this thesis is to display an internal critique of the neoclassical theory of health care consumption with the intention of understanding its true merits and limitations. To avoid arbitrariness, instead of criticizing it directly, this thesis first explores the existing scholarly critiques, as well as the developments of this theory in response to these criticisms. What is interestingly observed is that the neoclassical responses tend to systematically fall into two problematic categories - the trade-off between reality and theoretical determinacy, and free-market behavior resolution. Such observation suggests that there is something fundamentally problematic with this theory, which is overlooked by the existing critiques. Also, by looking into how consumer behavior is theorized in neoclassical framework, this thesis points out that the fundamental problem of this theory is embedded in the purely subjective and quantitative neoclassical notion of utility, which is the foundation that this theory is built on, as well as the interlocking characteristic of the neoclassical theoretical structure. Ultimately, this thesis argues that such in depth critique points us to a better alternative theoretical framework to analyze the consumption of health care.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A Model for Electrical Communication Between Cochlear Implants and the Brain</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In the last thirty years, cochlear implants have become an invaluable instrument in the treatment of severe-to-profound hearing impairment.  An important aspect of research in the continued development of cochlear implants is the in vivo assessment of signal processing algorithms intended to improve perception of speech and other auditory signals.  In trying to determine how closely cochlear implant recipients process sound relative to the processing done by a normal auditory system, various assessment techniques have been applied.  The  most common technique has been measurement of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), which involves the recording of neural responses to auditory stimulation.  Depending on the latency of the observed response, the evoked potential indicates neural activity at various ascending neurological structures of the auditory system.  Although there have been a number of publications on the topic of AEPs in cochlear implant subjects, there is a need for better measurement and research techniques to obtain more in-depth information to facilitate research on effectiveness of signal processing approaches in cochlear implants.The research presented herein explored the use of MatLab for the purpose of developing a model for electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs).  The EABR is commonly measured in hearing-impaired patients who have cochlear implants, via electrical stimulation delivered from electrodes in the implanted array.  The simulation model developed in this study took as its input the stimulus current intensity level, and used function vectors and equations derived from measured EABRs, to generate an approximation of the evoked surface potentials.  A function vector was used to represent the combined firing of the neurons of the auditory nervous system that are needed to elicit a measurable response.  Equations were derived to represent the latency and stimulus amplitude scaling functions.  The simulation also accounted for other neural activity that can be present in and contaminate an ABR recording, and reduced it through time-locked averaging of the simulated response.Predicted waveforms from the MatLab model were compared both to published waveforms from a cochlear implant recipient, and a series of EABR waveforms measured by the author in other cochlear implant recipients.  Measurement of the EABRs required specialized interfacing of a commercial recording system with the signal processors of the patients&apos; cochlear implants.  A novel measurement technique was also used to obtain more frequency-specific information than usually obtained.  Although the  nonlinearities normally present in the auditory system were not considered in this MatLab simulation, the model nevertheless performed well and delivered results comparing favorably with the results measured from the research subjects.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Peripheral injection of &amp;alpha-MSH promotes glucagon secretion in POMC knockout mice, suggesting the role of &amp;alpha-MSH in regulation of pancreatic &amp;alpha cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study investigated the stimulatory effect of &amp;alpha-MSH on mice pancreatic &amp;alpha cell line &amp;alphaTC1-6 cells in cell signaling pathway as well as glucagon secretion. In normal level of glucose, application of &amp;alpha-MSH stimulated L-type Ca&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;super&gt; current induced Ca&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;super&gt; induced Ca&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;super&gt; release (CICR) and membrane hyperpolarization. Increase of [cAMP]&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt; was also observed when &amp;alpha-MSH was applied with IBMX. Acute hypoglycemia-induced CICR via N- and L-type Ca&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;super&gt; channels was overridden by typical &amp;alpha-MSH response. Hypoglycemia with IBMX also triggered Ca&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;super&gt;-stimulated cAMP production.  In the presence of &amp;alpha-MSH, insulin failed to inhibit acute hypoglycemia-induced CICR. Finally, stimulation of &amp;alpha-MSH increased glucagon secretion significantly. These findings indicate that &amp;alpha-MSH promotes glucagon secretion in &amp;alphaTC1-6 cells by elevating micro-regional [cAMP]&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt; and [Ca&lt;super&gt;2+&lt;super&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Amino Acid Residues Implicated in the Interaction of Melanocortin Ligands and their Receptors: A Study of MC2R Selectivity</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Melanocortin receptor ligand selectivity has been a question not easily answered. The inability to functionally express melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) has inhibited the study of why MC2R is only stimulated by ACTH, a melanocortin hormone. With the recent discovery of the MC2R accessory protein (MRAP), creating a heterologous system is now feasible. Using a general cell line like CHO-K1 cells, which do not express endogenous MCRs, we were able to create a heterologous expression system and test the selectivity of MC2R using analog variants of ACTH(1-24). Our results indicate an amino acid requirement in the C-terminal portion of ACTH(1-24) for activation, which supports the 2-step method of activation hypothesized for MC2R. This site, the tetra basic cleavage site, when altered does not stimulate cAMP production and does not compete with ACTH(1-24) for binding. We also demonstrate the potential for a non-mammalian MC2R system in cloning full length Silurana tropicalis MC2R and completed localization studies with this system with MRAP using CHO-K1 cells.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this paper I analyze how various price regimes inherent to different oil industry structures affected crude oil prices in the 20th century.  Overall, there are strong relationships between oil prices and the corresponding price regimes.  Using an informal approach as well as concepts from economic theory, I also analyze the effects of supply and demand variables including spare capacity, stocks, futures prices, OPEC production, and GDP on crude oil prices from 2002 - 2007.  The results of my analysis are fairly consistent with economic theory as they elucidate the consequences of severe underinvestment in the oil industry and price volatility.  Additionally, I analyze current oil prices and assess the implications for the oil industry, OPEC, and alternative energy producers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Blood glucose levels are regulated by the interactions between insulin and glucagon.  Pancreatic alpha cells release glucagon in response to a drop in blood sugar.  Pancreatic alpha cells appear to be regulated through multiple signaling pathways.  One potential method of regulation occurs from α-MSH or epinephrine stimulated production of the intracellular messenger cyclic AMP.  Exocytosis of dense core vesicles containing glucagon ultimately requires an increase in cytosolic calcium.  This study focused on the link between cyclic AMP and calcium in pancreatic alpha cells which allows alpha cell regulation.  Interactions between calcium and cyclic AMP in pancreatic alpha cells consists of PKA-dependant and PKA-independent pathways.  The results indicate cyclic AMP  pathways control L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and also increase cytoplasmic calcium from intracellular stores.  Store release appears to be through IP3 mediated pathways and not through the ryanodine-sensitive receptor.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Biblical revision has been a part of the Jewish tradition since the Bible began to be canonized in the Second Temple period. Many authors throughout the centuries have seen fit to revise the biblical text: creating a new literary genre that is in this paper termed &quot;rewritten Bible.&quot; Maxine Grossman&apos;s literary critical method, as advocated in &lt;bold&gt; Reading for History in the Damascus Document: A Methodological Method&lt;/bold&gt;, helps us to understand the different types of meaning that can be created from a text, including meaning that is created outside the intent of the author, as it is in the genre of rewritten Bible.  The text of &lt;bold&gt; Jubilees&lt;/bold&gt; and Shulamith Hareven&apos;s &lt;bold&gt;Thirst: The Desert Trilogy&lt;/bold&gt; serve to demonstrate both the continuity of the act of revision in the Jewish tradition as well as how rewritten Bible has functioned in different societies in various time periods.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The overall theme of this paper is increasing knowledge of the evolution ofChinese priorities and strategy since the Korean War, and how the evolution of China&apos;srelationships reveals changes in priorities. Why were these partnerships entered into on the part of China?  What was China&apos;s strategic thinking?  How do strengths andweaknesses in these partnerships reflect China&apos;s changing priorities?  To attempt toanswer these questions, three case studies are used to reveal and analyze changes: Sino- North Korean relations since the Korean War, Sino-Russian relations after the end of the Cold War, and Chinese participation (relations with member states) in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  Consideration in this paper will also be given to the future stability of China&apos;s involvement with Russia and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Comparative Study of Transition to Democracy in Portugal and Iran</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The thesis compares the period of transition to democracy in Portugal and Iran after the collapse of the authoritarian regimes through revolutions in 1974 in Portugal and 1979 in Iran. Despite the similarities the cases share, the outcome of the transition in Portugal was a political democracy while Iran faced the rise of authoritarianism. The research compares the similar and dissimilar variables between Portugal and Iran such as the form of the break with authoritarianism and holding of initial elections, institutional design, involvement in wars, and popular mobilization. By keeping respecting factors as control variables, the thesis argues for the role of Ayatollah Khomeini, and elite decisions, as the most determinative factors influencing the political outcome. In Portugal, in the absence of a leader uniting the elite and inability of political factions to solely consolidate their power, the Portuguese elite had to compromise. In contrast, in Iran, a charismatic leader, who favored the Islamic Republican Party over other factions, played the most determinative role in directing Iran toward authoritarianism.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES ON THE EFFECTIVE PROPERTIES OF TWO-PHASE HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The effective elastic modulus and conductivity of a two phase material system are investigated computationally using a Monte Carlo scheme. The continuum contains circular, spherical or ellipsoidal inclusions that are either uniformly or randomly embedded in the matrix. The computed results are compared to the applicable effective medium theories. It is found that the random distribution, permeability and particle aspect ratio have non-negligible effects on the effective material properties. For spherical inclusions, the effective medium approximations agree well with the simulation results in general, but the analytical predictions on void or non-spherical inclusions are much less reliable. It is found that the results for overlapping and nonoverlapping inclusions do not differ very much at the same volume fraction.  The effect of the particle morphology is also investigated in the context of prolate and oblate ellipsoidal particles.The geometric percolation thresholds for circular, elliptical, square and triangular disks in the three-dimensional space are determined precisely by Monte Carlo simulations. These geometries represent oblate particles in the limit of zero thickness. The normalized percolation points, which are estimated by extrapolating the data to zero radius, are &amp;eta c=0.9614 &amp;plusmn 0.0005, 0.8647 &amp;plusmn 0.0006 and 0.7295 &amp;plusmn 0.0006 for circles, squares and equilateral triangles, respectively. These results show that the noncircular shapes and corner angles in the disk geometry tend to increase the interparticle connectivity and therefore reduce the percolation point. For elliptical plate, the percolation threshold is found to decrease moderately when the aspect ratio &amp;epsilon is between 1 and 1.5 but decrease rapidly for &amp;epsilon greater than 1.5. For the binary dispersion of circular disks with two different radii, &amp;eta c  is consistently larger than that of equisized plates, with the maximum value located at around r_1/r_2 =0.5.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Conversion to Islam in Colorado</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In the scholarship concerning conversion to Islam in the West, few books or articles have been written that examine non-African American US converts.  Furthermore, this literature generally neglects using models of conversion for analyzing US Muslims.  This thesis is an attempt to begin such a project.  For this thesis, I interviewed 13 converts to Islam over the course of a month and a half at a local mosque: 8 females and 5 males; 9 white, 3 Latina/o, and 1 non-African American black.  These converts told me their stories of conversion: beginning with their life prior to conversion, the process leading up to conversion, the conversion experience, and the events that took place after their conversion.  In this thesis I compare their responses with other studies of non-African American converts in the West.  While these converts share many similarities with their European counterparts, there are 4 prominent differences: the Denver converts, on the whole, had religious upbringings; most have moved several times throughout their lives; European converts tended to have higher education levels; and Denver converts are far less attracted to intellectual aspects of Islam, while being more attracted to spiritual aspects.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&quot;We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.  Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&quot;-Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1963).Technology, the Internet, and the ability to communicate with one another instantaneously in any place on the globe, at any point in time have made Dr. King&apos;s remarks increasingly evident in the 21st century.  We now have the unprecedented ability to communicate with people of all groups, all over the world, but are lacking the proper tools for understanding them.  The interreligious dialogue movement has strived to utilize religion as one tool, but its biases have limited its success.  Authentic dialogue can only be achieved by moving towards a broader definition of `religion,&apos; beyond the Protestant Christian paradigm in order to come to a place where one may authentically understand, the `other&apos;.  This paper illustrates this by combining scholarly research with case studies of three interreligious dialogue programs in the Denver area.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The relatively high cost of the high quality semiconductor materials (typically silicon) and complex conventional techniques for the fabrication of solar cells result in the overall high cost of the commercially available solar cells. Although, research in the field of solar technologies has been going on for a long time, but, utilization of solar energy still remains limited to a very few applications, owing to the high manufacturing costs and lower efficiency. In this work we present a new solar technology based on silicon photovoltaic micro-particles and demonstrate a fabrication technique for such particles. The photovoltaic micro-particles can be manufactured from waste or low grade silicon, thus, keeping the material and manufacturing costs low. Different diffusion techniques have been explored in this work to implement this fabrication process and manufacture the most efficient silicon PV particles. Different sets of silicon PV particles of different sizes have been fabricated, tested, and compared. It has also been demonstrated, how these silicon photovoltaic particles can be used to generate hydrogen from electrolytic solutions. Some future applications have also been proposed, such as, micro-particles based photo-electrochemical hydrogen generation system, self-assembled micro-particle based thin solar cells, and solar spray-paint. Further research in the growth of this technology may give rise to a whole new revolutionary solar cell technology.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&quot;Flaming Red Wig&quot; is a collection of short stories and prose poems with a critical preface. Both the preface and the creative work explore notions of artifice, apposition and entering into a text (both written and character) with stillness or intrusion. I try to create an examination and communion with language on much the same level, ultimately yielding a musicality that creates a rhythmic discourse and dynamic between the significance and the notion. The title of my thesis refers to the obvious motif of artifice and the reoccurring theme of emotional pain attached to gender and humanistic role within specific time frames.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examines the process of Vietnam&apos;s global integration for development in order to conclude that Vietnam has been able to achieve economic development and human development by joining regional and global institutions and working closely with multilateral international development agencies.With proper literature reviews of economic theories and empirical studies, this study determines that Vietnam was able to graduate from dependence on the former Soviet Union and achieved economic development and human development.This study determines that Vietnam has become one of the best-performing developing economies in the world. The Vietnamese people&apos;s standard of living has improved significantly. The World Bank estimates that within 10 years, from 1993 to 2004, Vietnam lifted 30 million people out of poverty.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The thesis project proposes analytical and theoretical algorithms for a networked swarm of autonomous vehicles, such as those used in planet exploration, and to be used in target location determination and convergence, an algorithm of this type could be used in an Autonomous Stratospheric Aircraft (ASA), thus having the possibility of being used for the exploration of a planet as well as many other applications. Upon locating an unknown location of a specified target, the algorithm would then swarm and eventually converge upon the location. There are two similar, but fundamentally different algorithms proposed in this project. These algorithms are capable of locating and converging upon multiple targeted locations simultaneously. This project is inspired by the current thought of NASA in the search of life on Mars, which is the Water&quot; where the targeted location would be the targeted source of water. These algorithms make use of combining a modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm with fuzzy variables for increased intelligence.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Gaming the Network Poetic: Networking and Code in Art Games</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Videogames have historically used networking either to connect players for competition or cooperation or to provide an ephemeral connection to allow the upload, comparison, or assessment of single-player achievement data. The majority of videogames take place on a screen and on established platforms each of which have physical, technical, and sociocultural constraints that dictate how a player will interact. Recent art games, such as those by Jason Rohrer and the Atari VCS games of Ian Bogost highlight experiments in a more focused use of the medium from concept to interaction, both between the player and the software but also foregrounding the code (both social codes and actual software) of the games. These artists are part of a growing movement of videogame creators that are involved not only as designers but also as cultural critics invested in the analysis of platforms and the distribution of their games.This thesis documents the development and exhibition of Gaming the Network Poetic, a series of five videogames developed by the author. This was itself an experiment in both the use of networking and in the exhibition of a cohesive art object incorporating these games. The work is then contextualized through the analysis of game-based art movements, the contemporary independent (or &quot;Indie&quot;) games movement, and contemporary software/code-based art. Also, given that much of the theory around videogames is rooted in literary criticism, philosophy, and cultural history, these disciplines are also referenced throughout the discussion.Further, this thesis will address questions about the aesthetic, mechanical, and audience-related considerations of developing and installing videogames in a contemporary art space that shows mostly static work. What roles does the audience play in such an environment? How can videogames create meaning? How does one communicate emotion through a single videogame? How does the open networking of several videogames quickly add complexity, and how can that complexity be managed? What are the issues involved in choosing particular hardware and software platforms on which to present the work?</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Georgia: Frozen Conflict and the Role of Displaced Persons</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Though commonly overlooked, communities of displaced persons often play a complex and significant role in the emergence and perpetuation of ethnic conflict. This paper looks at the intersection of these themes in the conflict between the former Soviet Republic of Georgia and the separatist region of Abkhazia. In particular it looks at the nature of protracted or &quot;frozen&quot; conflict with particular attention to the role of the displaced community in the conflict&apos;s entrenchment. Specifically, it seeks to answer the question: why do certain conflicts go unresolved for so long, and what role do refugees play in this resolution resistance?The paper is based on field research conducted in Georgia, including interviews with 45 Georgian internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Abkhazia. The results of the study suggest that various forces and motivations acting on the IDP community have the effect of entrenching it in the ambiguous state of neither returning to Abkhazia nor integrating into Georgian society that has become the status quo, and that this entrenchment plays a role in the factors that contribute to the frozen state of the conflict. In particular, the study suggests that power and identity play an unexpectedly large role in maintaining this population&apos;s status quo.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The smaller the robot the easier it is for it to access voids in a collapsed structure, however small size brings a host of other problems related to constrained resources. One of the primary constraints on small robots is limited motive power to surmount obstacles and navigate rough terrain. This thesis examines the addition of bulk motive force actuators to existing locomotion platforms and the impact of these heterogeneous actuators on conventional steering methods. The steering methods examined are those associated with skid steered vehicles and differential drive vehicles. In developing the Crabinator, a robot composed of a limbed crawler module and a single track drive module, it appeared that the resulting robot did not fit in the regime of differential drive. For that reason the heterogeneous differential drive class was developed. Similarly for the water hammer active tether module this system also did not appear to be a heterogeneous differential drive or skid steered vehicles. This system turned out to be even more general hence the more general class of heterogeneous drive vehicles which has input of accelerations rather then velocities as the previously mentioned classes.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Hilltop Archaeology: Ceremony and Ritual at the site of Cerro Santa Rita, Chao Valley, Peru</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Site of Cerro Santa Rita is located in the mid-valley region of the Chao Valley on the North Cast of Peru.  Occupied by people during the Gallinazo, Moche and Chimú time periods, Cerro Santa Rita fulfilled a role similar to that of a huaca, or temple.  The people of pre-Hispanic Peru were deep set in their traditions, many of these traditions are still practiced by Peruvians today.  The traditions of ancestor veneration and feasting are no exceptions to this.  Cerro Santa Rita was a burial complex that had plazas and courtyards associated with the tombs of ancestors.  Not as elaborate or large as the huacas to the north in the Moche and Chicama Valleys, which served as regional, administrative and religious centers, Cerro Santa Rita was more oriented to local ceremony.  Ceramic and biological evidence suggests that parts of Cerro Santa Rita were unitized as designated areas for food and beverage production, these areas lack plazas and demonstrate a limited variability in ceramic morphologies.  These practices demonstrate that public ceremony and feasts provided the social cohesion on a local level that was required in the outlying valleys, such as the Chao. This was necessary if Gallinazo, Moche and Chimú power centers to the north were going to maintain access to and influence over trade networks.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the responses to terrorism increased throughout the world.  The face of Homeland Security is now heavily focused on the prevention, preparedness, response and recovery of terrorist attacks not only in the United States, but also amongst some of America&apos;s oldest allies.  This thesis studies the level of change in homeland security strategy of European NATO members after the 9/11 attacks in the United States.  The analysis of strategic components within each NATO member&apos;s homeland security strategy (history, laws, counterterrorism agencies and budget support) shows significant change.  The international community&apos;s perspective and role in terrorism and homeland security strategy can be an important component toward the safety and security in the United States.  Terrorism&apos;s influence on homeland security programs abroad is evidence that its successful mitigation and defeat will be contingent upon international cooperation and strategy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Glaucoma is a group of optic nerve disease with progressive structural changes leading to loss of visual function. A careful examination and detection of changes in the optic nerve is the key to early diagnosis of glaucoma. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is one of the known techniques of diagnosis of glaucoma. The patients&apos; eyes are scanned and sub-surface images are captured from optical nerves. Captured OCT images usually suffer from noise and therefore image enhancement techniques can help doctors in better analysis of OCT images and diagnosis of glaucoma. In this thesis, we propose three successful algorithms for enhancing the quality and the contrast of OCT images. Our experiments on sample OCT images show that our algorithms can remove noise and disturbance in images and significantly enhance the visual quality of the glaucoma images. Information theory is widely used in image processing these years. It is proved that information theory is very useful to show the trends between the systems. By using information theory, the ability of each algorithm in enhancing the quality of OCT images is examined. Information theory helped us to find out the relationships of the algorithms. In this research, we use sequential images taken in different time of a same patient and compare the health level of them with the help of Information theory. Information theory successfully helped to provide trends among the sequential images, which will help doctors to diagnosis.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Combating tamarisk (&lt;italic&gt;Tamarix&lt;/italic&gt; spp.), an exotic tree species that has invaded 1-1.6 million hectares of riparian land in the Midwestern United States, with the introduced leaf beetle &lt;italic&gt;Diorhabda elongata&lt;/italic&gt; provides an opportunity to evaluate how the trophic spectra of terrestrial insects respond to a herbivorous biocontrol. To evaluate this restoration approach and the interaction biocontrol may have with terrestrial insect populations, I quantified trophic unit richness and abundance and common family abundance of resident insect populations while also measuring biocontrol abundance and status during the previous season (present or not present).  These measurements were taken four times throughout one season in monotypic tamarisk at two locations in Grand County, Utah. Biocontrol abundance was lower when biocontrol had been present in the previous season.  Predator, omnivore and herbivore richness and omnivore, Histeridae, Lygeaidae and Formicidae abundance showed a relationship with biocontrol abundance.  When biocontrol had been present in the previous season, predator richness and, Histeridae abundance was higher while when biocontrol had not been present in the previous season herbivore richness and detritivore, Lygeaidae and Elateridae abundance was higher.  The results suggest relationships exist between&lt;italic&gt; D.elongata&lt;/italic&gt; and multiple members of the trophic spectra of terrestrial insects that changes when biocontrol have been present for more than one season.  If &lt;italic&gt;D. elongata&lt;/italic&gt; are adding connections and complexity to the trophic spectra through these relationships with terrestrial insects than the use of biocontrol in monotypic tamarisk stands may help preserve what is left of the trophic web in the invaded ecosystem.  Understanding the side effects of a biocontrol on the trophic structure of an ecosystem is essential to land management.  At the same time, this work provides a more thorough understanding of the effect of herbivorous biocontrol on the trophic ecology of disturbed ecosystems.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, this study was designed to understand how indigenous groups assert their sovereign rights in conflict situations, and how they can be most successful in doing so.Two instances of indigenous-state conflict were analyzed and compared both to each other and to a baseline of what sovereignty in conflict is, based on the United Nations Declaration. Data to be analyzed and compared was gathered through extensive archival research and interviews with tribal members and other interested parties.The results documented the interaction between indigenous groups and state/provincial and federal governments in conflict, and suggested that indigenous groups should assert their sovereignty both in the courts, for long-term success, and using other methods to build a power base that will contribute to short-term success. The data also suggests that key components necessary for indigenous groups in general to assert sovereignty in conflict situations include a united front with strong leadership and no corruption; having enough strength to gain attention and assert sovereignty; a continuous assertion of sovereignty through action; and an ability to see beyond the legal paradigm in using other methods either alone or in conjunction with appealing to the courts. These conclusions lead to suggestions for ways that indigenous groups can improve their assertion of sovereignty in conflict situations. The study itself also gives a guide to those engaged in similar situations as to how sovereignty can be better respected in resolution processes and outcomes.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Iraq:- The Way Forward A Political Strategy To Win &amp; End the War In Iraq</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The challenges to stability, unity, and democracy in Iraq are typically characterized as factional (sectarian and ethnic) or as struggle against the presence of foreign troops. However, this assumption remains largely erroneous. The problems and challenges in Iraq are actually and overwhelmingly the result of power struggles, and the competition for resources by political elites, and dominant political factions.The political and electoral system emplaced in Iraq incentivizes elites and political entities to undertake factional identities; in doing so, it promotes identity politics.  The current system also fails to filter the contests for power through the electoral system.  As such, fragmentation within the government is maximized, and the political system in Iraq becomes one that promotes extremism and incorporates extremist views, thus, creating paralysis and hindering progress.Consequently, this study proposes redesigning the Iraqi electoral system in a way that compels elites to secure cross-factional support.  Such an approach will force political elites and candidates to undertake median and moderate approaches to win and will promote moderate elites who must gain the support of the people.  This will allow reconciliation efforts to progress steadily and will put Iraq on the right path for consolidating its nascent democracy.  Vitally important, such a system will provide for democratic consolidation and sustainability without the need of external interference.  The challenge, however, is in deciding how to introduce such an institutional redesign due to entrenched interests of parties and elites that are served under the current system.The current political system in Iraq is parliamentarian; it follows the concept of infusion of powers and is based on &quot;consensus&quot; and informal consociation. The electoral system in Iraq is a closed-party-list proportional representation.  This study proposes an alternative political and electoral system.  As a substitute political system, this study proposes a hybrid system that largely follows the concept of separation of powers.  Under this system the chief executive--as opposed to the head of state--will be directly elected by the people through a customized majoritarian system that conditions victory in elections not only on achieving 50+% of the vote, but also on achieving certain thresholds in 16 out of the 18 Iraqi provinces. Thus, only candidates who are acceptable to all the &quot;components&quot; of Iraqi society will assume the responsibility of governing Iraq.The Presidency Council--the head of state--can follow the consociational principle, and remain as it is now. At present, the presidency council in Iraq--which will give over power to a President in the next elections--consists of a President and two Vice Presidents. The presidency council&apos;s members are representatives of the three major components of the Iraqi society--Shiite, Sunni, and, Kurd.  This can remain unchanged, voted in by parliament.  In fact, preserving this would check the strong Prime Minister proposed under this system. As such, transparency, accountability, decisiveness, and cohesion, will be combined with oversight.As for elections to the legislature, this study proposes to convert the electoral rules to single-member districts.  Districts must be delineated in such a way that candidates will largely compete against people of their own (sectarian or ethnic) identity.  Hence, candidates will be unable to invoke their identities as credentials to win elections.  Where possible, minorities in districts will be included so that serious candidates competing against others from their-own identity will be forced to appeal also to people other than their identities. This will further compel candidates to undertake moderate stands.Essentially, the proposed system enhances the accountability of elected officials to the electorate; it promotes substantive politics rather than descriptive politics in Iraq; and it allows for the steady consolidation of democracy.  The proposed system also maintains unity within the executive branch, and opens the way for reconciliation, reconstruction, the provision of services and security, and political stability.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&lt;bold&gt;Abstract&lt;/bold&gt;IRUS is both a research project and art exhibition that form and analyze cultural exchange.  Using art that is developed dialogically and collaboratively between Iranian and American artists, the project employs digital media and the traditional mailing system to create an intercultural exhibition.The exhibition (March 21st, 2009) brings together two teams of artists, one in Tehran and another in Denver, that  have assembled under one name: IRUS (Iran - United States), and collaborate under a common theme: dialogue. Both teams consist of artists proficient in various media.The research will document, and analyze the dialogue process through the lens of concepts involved in the exhibition and will provide insight into how a dialogue between individuals of these two teams formed. It will also address and question to what extent collaborative art projects between cultures help participant gain a better understanding of each other?  To what extent can digital media and telepresence art be used as a bridge in bringing together such collaborations considering the limitations of the Internet in Iran,  the differences in access, speed, and language proficiency that shape mediated interactions, and the limiting system of the post office in both countries?</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Japan&apos;s Preventive Strategy: Secure the World - The National Defense Program Guidelines in and after FY 2010 -</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Japanese government is now reviewing the National Defense Program Guidelines in and after FY 2005 (NDPG 04), and this review will be completed by the end of this year.  Even though NDPG 04 provides Japan&apos;s security and defense policy vision to FY 2014, the government nevertheless has decided to change it completely. The purpose of this thesis is to know the reason why the Japanese government has decided to change NDPG 04 completely, the likely contents of NDPG 09, and NDPG 09&apos;s effect on the US-Japan alliance.The globalizing international society and threats have been increasingly diversified and multi-polarized since the end of the Cold War, and Japan cannot deal with them alone.  The fiscal crisis and scandals within the ministry of defense (MOD) and the Japan Self Defense Force (JSDF) have led to a renewed discussion of the security of Japan and the US-Japan security arrangement, particularly given the present five-year review of NDPG 04 now underway.  The Japanese political environment on national security changed dramatically during the Koizumi administration (2001-06), which allowed for calm discussion of Japan&apos;s security policy not just among Japan&apos;s leaders, but also among the general population.More recently, governmental policymakers have recognized that it is impossible for Japan to deal with these international and domestic security issues under NDPG 04 and with the present security and defense system. Therefore they have decided to strengthen Japan&apos;s security system in the forthcoming NDPG 09 while still remaining compliant with Article 9 of the Japan&apos;s Constitution.  Whichever party or party coalition wins the next general election later this year, the new leadership likely will see Japan&apos;s cooperation not only with the United States, but also with other countries both bilaterally and multilaterally in international organizations as essential to preventing diversified threats from reaching Japan.  In this regard, a Sun Tzu style preventive strategy appears to be the best way to secure Japan and contribute to global security.This thesis represents the views of its author, not those of the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force to which its author belongs, or any other agency of the Japanese government.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Jean Toomer&apos;s Cane is considered one of the literary achievements of the Harlem Renaissance, though the many of his philosophical ideas which inspired it are dismissed.  Inversely, Carl Van Vechten&apos;s influence as an advocate and patron of African American art is foundational though his Nigger Heaven is dismissed. However, there are commonalities in each authors identity positioning and subsequent exploitation of the black Harlem Renaissance ethos.  Further, their utilization of Gurdjieffian principles of objectivity and primitivist images of blacks links and explains, in part, how their identities contributed to the ideas expressed in the novels.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>&lt;bold&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/bold&gt;Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASN) is an emerging technology which utilizes wireless sensors to implement real-time wearable health monitoring of patients to enhance independent living. These sensors can be worn externally to monitor multiplebio-parameters (such as blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure and heart activity) of multiple patients at a central location in the hospital.In health monitoring, the loss of critical or emergency information is a serious issue so there is a concern for quality of service which needs to be addressed. It is important to have an estimate of the time the first node will fail in order to replace or recharge the battery. A common type of failure happens when a node runs out of energyand shuts down.In this work, Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the lifetime of WBASN. The lifetime of the WBASN is defined in this work as the duration of time until the first sensor failure due to battery depletion. A parametric model of the health care network is created with sets of random input distributions. Probabilistic analysis is used to determine the timing and distributions of nodes&apos; failures in the health monitoring network.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study offers an analysis of media literacy practices and techniques used at local public middle and high schools in Colorado. Media literacy is an emerging field in education that blends literacy skills such as critical analysis and evaluation with an inquiry-based questioning process that encourages students to process information using cognitive, moral, aesthetic and emotional dimensions. This inquiry-based process is not a new educational approach; it has been used to critically evaluate literature for centuries. However, media literacy scholars argue that applying inquiry-based approaches can enhance learning across all grades and content levels by applying new methodologies.The literature reviewed suggests that the effectiveness of media literacy approaches in schools is influenced by social factors. Potter (2001) argued that students bring their own background and perspectives to the learning environment and for this reason, he believes media literacy must be measured based on a continuum and not a category; because there are different degrees of media literacy based on the strength of perspective and knowledge structures. According to Potter, people&apos;s regular routines are largely conditioned by the media, enabling producers of mediated messages to shape and frame what is important. A 2003 empirical study by Hobbs and Frost found that an experimental media literacy curriculum can be used to enhance traditional literacy skills and meet traditional educational goals. The authors found that students in the media literacy treatment group scored higher than the control group in reading comprehension and viewing comprehension and recognized the longer paragraphs and fewer spelling errors of the treatment group as representing superior development in writing skills. The overall analysis of the non-fiction informational messages showed that the media literacy treatment group was better prepared to analyze media messages in regard to construction techniques, point of view, omitted information, comparison and contrast and identification of message purpose.Thoman and Jolls (2004) promote the consideration of key questions and an inquiry-based approach in analyzing and critically understanding media messages. The scholars argue that using key questions to evaluate messages promotes higher order thinking by identifying concepts and fallacies within mediated messages, focusing on the learning process and not the content. Although the question set was designed to be used with media content, the authors define media very broadly to include books and other materials prevalent in classrooms. According to Thoman and Jolls (2004) the inquiry process calls for multiple interpretations of messages, which requires observation and critical thinking. These skills can illuminate bias, challenge stereotypes and uncover the motivations of producers, exposing implicit and explicit meanings. According to the scholars, the habitual application of an inquiry-based line of questioning encourages students to think for themselves, helping them control the interpretation of what they see or hear.The literature reviewed established that media literacy is a fervent topic amongst education scholars and inquiry-based approaches can prepare and empower students to live in an information-rich world. However, little to no research evaluates local practices in Colorado compared with national media literacy initiatives, and I established my research questions based on this gap. The goals of this study were twofold: First, archival data from national media literacy organizations were researched and evaluated to outline some best practices in introducing media literacy into any curriculum. State and district documents designed as a framework for the implementation of technology and information literacy were evaluated for key terms and concepts. This evaluation suggested that although some concepts overlap between information and media literacy, such as critical evaluation, independent learning, and information analysis, there is also a gap between these two concepts. Important media literacy concepts including discussion, creation, and production are missing from the information literacy skill sets.One possibility on the district level is defining information literacy skills to the same degree that technology literacy skills are defined to help promote an inquiry-based approach. Evaluating information literacy separately from technology takes the focus off technology and establishes measurable concepts and definitions of information literacy. In addition, one might think about integrating key questions as a framework to promoting critical evaluation of all subject matter. This includes questions like: who created the message; what is communicated or implied by the message; when was the message created; where is the message being directed; how did the producers use creative techniques to capture attention; and why is this message being sent. Some teachers reported already using these questions and many agreed that this type of inquiry increases students&apos; overall literacy. Using the key questions as a framework for classifying information literacy might help characterize information skills.The archival data, in conjunction with Potter&apos;s (2001) theoretical concepts of media literacy development, were used to create a survey issued to all middle and high school teachers in the Denver and Eagle County districts. The survey was constructed under the assumption that teachers are already using media content in their classrooms. The purpose of the questions was to understand what media resources are available to teachers and how they apply these resources to their particular curriculum. The survey questions teachers about their perceptions of media use and discussion in the classroom. Teachers were surveyed about the benefits and challenges of using media in the classroom, including self-censorship to avoid negative backlash. Perceptions were measured by asking scaled questions that assess current practices, available resources, and inhibiting factors. Teachers&apos; experience and perceptions of media use and discussion was evaluated within the context of the Colorado Information Literacy Standards, specific district technology and information literacy plans, and national approaches to integrating media literacy education.In an effort to position this project in the context of larger educational changes, the quantitative and qualitative responses from the survey offer specific examples of how local teachers use media to help students learn and understand differently. The survey results revealed that although media is perceived positively by teachers as a teaching tool, respondents were more likely to consider the cognitive dimension of information and media analysis. Employing the use of key questions to frame both mediated and non-mediated information addresses the moral, emotional, and aesthetic dimensions of media literacy, broadening student perspectives and knowledge structures. This critical evaluation process takes the focus off media content, and emphasizes the process by which students acquire information.Participants suggested that they use media most often to encourage participation and teach different perspectives, and the quantitative survey responses indicated that a lack of resources is the most common reason teachers avoid using and discussing media content in their classrooms. This is why the media literacy approaches are effective: They do not require any technology resources. Qualitative, open-ended survey responses revealed that many teachers also felt inadequately trained to use technology in the classroom. For this reason, schools might consider creating an orientation for teachers about the technology resources available in their schools. Successful orientations might cover the set up, use and disassembly of technology resources and could be taught by mentor teachers who are competent users of technology and comfortable using it as a teaching tool. Finally, constructing an inventory of available technology in each school would offer teachers a tangible reference list and could also facilitate the maintenance of technology resources.Significant differences were discovered between the districts regarding their agreement with statements about encouraging debate in relation to controversial content. Also, while most teachers listed a lack of resources as their main reason for avoiding information use, Eagle County teachers reported that inappropriate content inhibited their media use most often. For this reason, local districts might consider more critical perspectives when examining and teaching with media content. By focusing on critically evaluating media content, teachers stress inquiry-based learning skills and not media subject matter For example, defining media as an information source and outlining other information sources accessed by students including textbooks and traditional non-mediated materials helps students develop awareness of credibility and bias in information sources. This may include an understanding of the role of media industries as a unique information source within a democracy that is governed by distinct rules and regulations. One possibility the districts might consider is creating a resource center for teachers who wish to use media literacy approaches in their classrooms, which will facilitate the availability of resources. This could be set up in the library or faculty lounge, and promotes sharing and compilation of useful resources. Establishing a media literacy library might encourage teachers unfamiliar with media literacy approaches to participate. The development of a resource center could encourage staff development programming to more regularly consider media use and discussion. It also gives teachers access to appropriate media content.Finally, the districts might consider outlining the specific technology skills expected of students in the district documents, offering a reference list that can serve as a measurement tool. Although this doesn&apos;t fall into the realm of this research, it is of interest that in Eagle County, the staff and teacher skills are specifically defined, while student skills are not. DPS did not list technology skills expected of staff or students. Establishing a framework of what skills are expected of students at each grade level provides the district with measurable concepts that can be evaluated and updated based on emerging technology and student needs. By taking the focus off of technology and technology-based skills, the district plans could shift gears to an inquiry-based framework, which would minimize the lack of resources or technology proficiency reported by teachers. By emphasizing the importance of information skills and distinguishing them clearly from technology-based skills, the Denver and Eagle County districts would encounter less difficulty in securing staff proficiency.These recommendations are based on the gaps that emerged in the quantitative and qualitative survey data. These recommendations synthesize the overlaps and identify gaps between media and information literacy skill sets, and came to fruition based on the voices of Colorado teachers. They can be implemented in any school or grade level. Although media literacy approaches focus on media as an information source, the 12 Basic Principles define media broadly to include many communication forms from books and magazines to recorded music and the Internet. For this reason, information literacy skills could be developed through the application of media literacy approaches that do not overlap with themes prevalent in the CILS. The findings of this study reveal a need for both district documents to be restructured to define separate goals, objectives, strategies and tactics for the technology and information literacy components of the plans.The survey response rate (17 %) was a limiting factor in this research. The diversity of size in the two districts researched affected the demographic diversity of the sample, resulting in a higher percentage of respondents from DPS. Further research is needed to determine whether the significant differences between the two districts apply to other regions of the state. Although the aims of this research focused on teacher perceptions and practices, future research might measure the affects on students. Implementing an experimental media literacy curriculum similar to that conducted by Hobbs and Frost (2003) on a local level would be an effective way to measure whether the integration of media literacy approaches continues to enhance student literacy.Advances in technology have caused a shift in education, requiring that students gain proficiency in computer and technology skills; however school resources are a limiting factor. By expanding the skill sets to include media literacy, schools can cultivate the critical thinking skills necessary for students to succeed in the 21st century, both independently and in the classroom.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Negotiating with Separatist Terrorists</dc:title>

  <dc:description>It is in the interest of this thesis to investigate why governments negotiate with separatist terrorists, and why those negotiations succeed or fail. The four cases analyzed in this thesis include: Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, (1983-2009); Russia and the Chechen Republic, (1994-2009); Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, (1993-1994); and Great Britain and the Irish Republican Army, (1985-2009).  In this study, four basic questions are addressed: When and why do governments agree to negotiate with separatist terrorists? Is negotiation a viable solution to ending historic ethnic conflicts? Are certain peace agreements and negotiation strategies more successful than others? And why, after having secured a settlement, do tensions erupt and violations occur?My research indicated that governments negotiate with separatist terrorists when faced with a mutually hurting stalemate and a mutually perceived solution. However, the postponement of a final status solution undermined the stability of these ripe moments, for ripe moments are susceptible to resurgent violence. Furthermore, my findings illustrated that negotiation is a viable solution to ending ethnic conflict. However, it is more likely to be successful if insurgent groups are perceived to have rational leadership and finite objectives. My findings demonstrated that imposed settlements are more successful than negotiated settlements in terminating conflicts, as only one of the four negotiated settlements analyzed in this study can be considered a success. Lastly, my research illustrated that negotiations do not fail exclusively because they involve terrorist actors. Rather, negotiations fail when both parties&apos; leadership is inflexible and extremist or when a final status solution is delayed. They fail when absolute claims for self-determination and independence clash with inflexible positions on territorial integrity or when neither side is willing to comply with the terms of the agreement. And they fail without broad support or without the presence of a powerful, objective third party mediator.Ultimately, my findings illustrate that negotiation readiness, rather than conflict ripeness, is more important to achieving successful negotiation between states and separatist groups. All of the cases experienced conflict ripeness. Only the IRA/UK study, however, demonstrated complete negotiation readiness: the conflict was perceived as risky, yet spoiler violence was missing; a neutral and coercive third party mediator was present; and lengthy back-channel communication was used. My findings further illustrate that the absence of spoilers and spoiler-induced violence, combined with the guidance of a forceful mediator, most significantly contributed to a successful negotiation. Certainly, ripe environments foster negotiation. It is complete negotiation readiness, however, that cultivates a successful peace agreement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This thesis explores the Washington State 1890s railroad boomtown, Ocosta&lt;&amp;minus&gt;by&lt;&amp;minus&gt;the&lt;&amp;minus&gt;Sea through place, microhistory, and narrative theories.  Place theory focuses analysis on the townsite.  A microhistory is created by the presentation of three narratives on Ocosta: the city&lt;&amp;minus&gt;as&lt;&amp;minus&gt;imagined, the city&lt;&amp;minus&gt;as&lt;&amp;minus&gt;built, and the city&lt;&amp;minus&gt;as&lt;&amp;minus&gt;remembered.  The city&lt;&amp;minus&gt;as&lt;&amp;minus&gt;imagined narrative recounts the city that Ocosta was projected to become by its founders through analysis of historic maps, advertisements, and financial investments of the city&apos;s founders.  The city&lt;&amp;minus&gt;as&lt;&amp;minus&gt;built uncovers information about the built environment of the site.  The city&lt;&amp;minus&gt;as&lt;&amp;minus&gt;remembered reveals the city that has and is remembered by the local community.  Site memory is explored through 1890s written accounts, 1950s radio transcripts from a local oral history program, a 2007 oral history event, and interviews with current residents in 2008.  A fourth narrative is constructed by the reader while they read the text.  This narrative contains the meaning of Ocosta that the reader has created for themselves while reading this text.   Together, these narratives explore meanings that humans have written on the cultural landscape of Ocosta&lt;&amp;minus&gt;by&lt;&amp;minus&gt;the&lt;&amp;minus&gt;Sea.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Millimeter-waves have found wide application in various fields. In this research, MMW generation, transmitting and receiving, multiplexing techniques are investigated. Three ways of MMW generation based on photonics are discussed. By modeling these three techniques and applying different situations of transmission links up to 100 km and fixed bit rate of 2.5 Gb/s, different results were found and compared to each other. Also, the effect of chromatic dispersion is discussed in addition to the phase conjugation way of dispersion compensation. Dispersion compensation based on phase conjugation was also simulated and applied to OSSB millimeter-wave generator in order to transmit the generated signals through 100 km of fiber and data rate of 10 Gb/s without dispersion effect.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study seeks to assess if the 2007 electoral failures of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) in Jordan, and the Justice and Development Party (PJD) in Morocco, represent a weakening of power, or merely a minor diversion in the quest of Islamists to attain greater political voice in both countries.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Reducing Disparities in the Adult Criminal Justice System: Creating a Model for Denver CountyAbstractOverrepresentation in the criminal justice system of people who are marginalized by society has been researched for decades.  Major challenges as they relate to overrepresentation of people of color in the system include a silo approach to research which leans towards analyzing system decision points in a vacuum, the misuse of official statistics to determine who is involved in crime, and the difficulty in translating solutions to the problem into practice.  Disparate treatment of people of color in the American criminal justice system has also been reported by the United Nation&apos;s International Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination as a significant human rights issue.This thesis makes recommendations in three areas for local work on this issue:  to ensure the buy-in and commitment of local government leadership to addressing the problem, ideally in a community-wide effort that includes entities and practices outside of the criminal justice system, to employ the methods as outlined in the OJJDP&apos;s Disproportionate Minority Contact Technical Assistance Manual for identifying and reducing the overrepresentation of people of color in the local criminal justice system, and to tie funding when possible to involvement by local agencies in reducing disparities in the Denver criminal justice system.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a quagmire of interests working against one another.  In this paper, I explore the specific role of religio-political groups in the conflict.  I particularly examine the ideological political and religious foundations of Gush Emunim and Hamas, paying much attention to the question of why they are attractive to people in our current era.  I argue that these groups are continuously effective in opposing the current quest for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and that they continue to grow as the result of an identity crisis brought about by factors related to globalization and the failure of secular governments in the region.  The two religio-political groups I explore pose a significant barrier to a peace agreement.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Role of Pro-Apoptotic BCL2-homology-3 Domain (BH3)-only Proteins in the Mutant SOD1 Mouse Model of ALS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease involving rapid degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and retraction of their axonal projections to the neuromuscular junctions. Several known mutations linked to some familial cases of ALS have been linked to mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), resulting in mitochondrial oxidative stress and intrinsic apoptosis. Transgenic mice expressing a G93A mutant of SOD1 provide an in vivo model to investigate motor neuron death during disease progression. The principal regulators of intrinsic apoptosis are the Bcl-2 family proteins. While some members of this family are pro-survival, the Bcl-2 homology-3 domain (BH3)-only proteins are pro-apoptotic. Since cooperation of various BH3-only proteins is often necessary to induce apoptosis, we hypothesized that multiple BH3-only proteins are induced in spinal motor neurons during the progression of ALS. Furthermore, we postulated that these pro-apoptotic proteins act in a coordinated manner to cause motor neuron death. We utilized laser capture microdissection (LCM) to collect highly enriched populations of spinal motor neurons from wild type vs. SOD1 mutant mice. RNA was then isolated from the captured motor neurons and used for quantitative real time PCR analysis of BH3-only transcript expression. We did not detect any significant differences in the expression of BH3-only transcripts between end stage SOD1 mutant mice and age-matched wild type animals. In contrast, immunohistochemical staining for the BH3-only proteins, Bik, Bad, BNip3, Bid, Noxa, Puma, and Hrk/Dp5, demonstrated selective staining of Hrk/Dp5, Bnip3, and Bid in astrocytes of lumbar spinal cord from end stage mutant SOD1 mice. Hrk/Dp5, Bnip3, and Bid were not observed in astrocytes of wild type mouse spinal cords. These novel findings indicate a potentially important role for astrocytes expressing Hrk/Dp5, Bnip3, and Bid in ALS disease progression.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In many networks, such as mobile ad-hoc networks and friend-to-friendoverlay networks, direct communication between nodes islimited to specific neighbors.  Friend-to-friend ``darknet&apos;&apos; networkshave been shown to commonly have asmall-world topology; while short paths exist between any pair ofnodes in small-world networks, it is non-trivial to determine suchpaths with a distributed algorithm.  Recently, Clarke and Sandbergproposed the first decentralized routing algorithm that achievesefficient routing in such small-world networks.Herein this thesis we discuss the first independent securityanalysis of Clarke and Sandberg&apos;s routing algorithm. We show that arelatively weak participating adversary can render the overlayineffective without being detected, resulting in significant dataloss due to the resulting load imbalance.  We have measured theimpact of the attack in a testbed of 800 and 400 total nodes usingminor modifications to Clarke and Sandberg&apos;s implementation of theirrouting algorithm in Freenet. Our experiments show that the attackis highly effective, allowing a small number of malicious nodes tocause rapid loss of data on the entire network.We also discuss various proposed countermeasures designed to detect,thwart or limit the attack.  We found that the ``darknet&apos;&apos; topologylimits the ability of effective countermeasures. The problem offixing the topology proved so intractable due to inherent networkcharacteristics that the idea of using a darknet for Freenet hasbeen all but abandoned following the public release of this work.Our hope is that the presented analysis acts as a step towardseffective analysis and design of secure distributed routingalgorithms for restricted-route topologies.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Recently the inefficiency and lack of capabilities of electric energy transmission have been put in the global spotlight; a transmission line design known as the Aluminum Conducting Composite Core Trapezoidal Wire (ACCC/TWTM) attempts to eliminate the deficiencies.  The ACCC core is comprised of a new hybrid composite material.  The most probable causes of short-term damage to the ACCC core were investigated through a series of finite element models.  It was found that excessive bending was the most likely cause of short-term damage to the core.  During bending of the ACCC core, stresses are concentrated at the interface in the carbon fiber composite region.  The composite materials&apos; compressive strength was measured, and found to be significantly lower than similar composite materials based upon the same reinforcing fiber.  An excessive bending finite element model was experimentally validated through a series of four point bend experiments in which acoustic emissions were monitored.  From this work, it has been determined the extent to which the ACCC core can be bent without creating significant damage.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The classic view of the nitrogen cycle in soils is for plants to take up inorganic N in solution for N nutrition. More recent studies reveal plants can take up low molecular weight dissolved organic N such as amino acids directly from the soil. In ecosystems where the rate of microbial mineralization is limited, plants may take up 10 to 200 percent more amino acid N than mineral N. It is not known if plants take up amino acids in all ecosystems, however recent research shows that plants generally take up amino acids when they are present in high quantities relative to mineral N. Therefore, high proportions of soil amino acids correspond with a significant role in the N cycle. Amino acids, NH4+ and NO3- were measured to record plant available N in alpine, montane and lower tree line soils in the Colorado Front Range. Soils were sampled in forest and non-forest at three sites with varying temperatures and productivity. Some species in the dominant genera at each site, Kobresia, Artemisia, Festuca, Pinus and Picea are known to take up amino acids. Soils cores were collected in a) forest and tundra in the alpine tree line ecotone; b) montane forest and open forest; and c) the forest and shortgrass steppe at the lower tree line and shortgrass steppe ecotone. For this study, soil amino acids were extracted with water, and quantities of free amino acids were analyzed with OPAME fluorescence. Mineral N was extracted with KCl and measured on the Lachat QuikChem 8000. Amino acids were present in all ecosystems ranging from 1.05 to 1.78 mg N/kg soil. Quantities measured were sufficient to contribute N for plant uptake which is known to occur with concentrations of soil amino acids as low as 0.01 mg N/kg soil and may be very rapid when amino acids are &gt; 0.8 mg N/kg soil. The largest proportion of amino acids relative to mineral N was measured at upper tree line and smallest proportion at lower tree line, indicating the amino acids make up a greater proportion of plant available N where mineralization is limited by environmental variables. Amino acids likely contribute most to the N cycle in the upper tree line ecosystem where mineral N cannot fulfill plants annual N requirement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>On April 20, 1999 Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked into Columbine High School and killed 12 students and 1 teacher.  The days following the shooting were spent questioning their motive and it seems, to this day, some are still confused.  If those in charge of the investigation would have stopped pointing fingers and listened to the cries of the shooters and the students, they would see that Columbine was a time bomb.  Students tells stories of bullying and torment and many agree that a group of athletes dominated the school.Most who see bullying see it as entertaining, but the victims live with it all their lives.  Bullying is harmful as well as hurtful and needs to be recognized before it can be fought.  The film I have written takes a look at two young men years after being bullied.  We see how it has affected their lives long after high school and how they cope with seeing their bully again.  The strength they find as friends helps them to overcome their fears and take the steps necessary for moving on.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The maturation process of many prohormone molecules typically requires endoproteolytic cleavage C-terminal of dibasic residues, such as the K&lt;super&gt;141&lt;/super&gt;R&lt;super&gt;142&lt;/super&gt;↓ site N-terminal of the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) sequence in &lt;italic&gt;Silurana tropicalis&lt;/italic&gt; proopiomelanocortin (POMC).  In order to determine the absolute requirement of basic amino acid residues in the cleavage process, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to substitute alanine for the wild-type residues in the frog POMC open reading frame.  Specifically, the following underlined residues were individually targeted for alanine substitution: &lt;bold&gt;&lt;underline&gt;R&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;super&gt;137&lt;/super&gt;&lt;underline&gt;Q&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;super&gt;138&lt;/super&gt;&lt;underline&gt;E&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;super&gt;139&lt;/super&gt;&lt;underline&gt;N&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;super&gt;140&lt;/super&gt;&lt;underline&gt;K&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;super&gt;141&lt;/super&gt;&lt;underline&gt;R&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;super&gt;142&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;↓.  The mouse pancreatic αTC1.9 cell line, which expresses prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), was selected as the model system for transfection studies.  The processing of wild-type frog POMC was correctly predicted to mimic that observed in the intermediate pituitaries of the frog.  Moreover, biochemical analysis of mutant frog constructs in the α-cells revealed that alanine substitutions of K&lt;super&gt;141&lt;/super&gt; and R&lt;super&gt;142&lt;/super&gt;, but not of R&lt;super&gt;137&lt;/super&gt;, disrupted endoproteolytic cleavage resulting in a JP-α-MSH mutant fusion protein.  Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the αTC1.9 cells detected the relative gene expression levels of mouse PC2, glucagon but not PC1/3; detection of &lt;italic&gt;S. tropicalis&lt;/italic&gt; POMC was only evident in the transfected α-cells, which was consistent with immunocytochemical data.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Roman Catholic Church maintains that it cannot ordain women to the priesthood due to a lack of biblical warrant. The Church therefore relies upon the traditional concept of a Bridegroom-Bride relationship (read: Christ and His Church), which they say can only be maintained if a male priest serves as the representative of the invisible Christ for his Bride during the Eucharist. In this essay, we shall explore the role and treatment of Mary Magdalene and women in early texts and show that they actually did have prominent positions within at least some early Christian communities. Texts were altered, and selected for reasons that did not always have to do with doctrine. Therefore, the tradition of the Bridegroom-Bride relationship ought to be reconsidered as the later development it was, and the Church should reconsider not only its presentation of Mary Magdalene but also the possibility of women within the ordained priesthood.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Taking The &apos;Sport&apos; Out of Sports Parenting: Toward A Theory of Sport Related Parent-Child Communication Competency</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Research has shown that over-emphasis on winning is the number one reason why approximately seventy percent of the forty million children who participate in youth sports will quit by age 13. This study utilized a constructivist grounded theory approach to investigate the role of parent-child communication within the context of youth sports. A total of 22 athletes and 20 parents were recruited through a Western university to discuss messages exchanged during youth sport participation. The results suggest that the delineation between messages of support and pressure is largely dependent on discursive work done by both parent and child. Parents who employed competent communicative strategies to avoid miscommunications regarding participation and sports goals were able to provide support and strengthen the relationship despite pressurized situations. The present study frames the youth sport dilemma within a developing conceptualization of communicative (in)competence and offers theoretical implications for sport related parent-child communication competency (SRPCCC).</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Burden of Fetching Water: Using Caloric Expenditure as an Indicator of Access to Safe Drinking Water - A Case Study from Xieng Khouang Province, Lao PDR</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The Millennium Development Goals measure `access to improved drinking water&apos; using an indicator that defines access as the presence of an improved water source within 1 kilometer of a person&apos;s dwelling. This purely linear measurement has significant shortcomings, including a lack of consideration for the difficulty of the terrain being traversed and the weight of the loads being carried. This paper examines in detail the human energy costs associated with fetching water, first using two Lao villages as case studies, then applying a predictive energy expenditure model to measure the potential caloric effect of variations in the age and gender of water fetchers and in the nature of the terrain they must traverse. Results indicate that these factors have a substantial influence on energy expenditure, with one study village resident who walks 1 km to fetch water during part of the year spending more than 30% of her daily caloric intake on this task. This finding may have important implications on policies relating to water provision in the developing world.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Digitally-Born Identity: The Influence of Social Networking Sites on Teen Identity</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Based on in-depth interviews, this thesis examines how teens use Social Networking Sites (SNSs) to negotiate their identities. The thesis concludes that SNSs, such as MySpace and Facebook, facilitate a social connectivity that influences how teens portray themselves online. The process of constructing a self-presentation, receiving input from peers, and then modifying one&apos;s self-presentation in response is not new, but the speed at which it occurs and the very public way it is displayed on an SNS constitutes a change in how teens understand the ways in which they make and constantly remake their identities. The findings suggest that, as previous literature has noted, SNSs are pervasive and ubiquitous in the lives of teens. However, it also concludes that SNSs are not uniform and that teens use SNSs differently, an aspect of SNSs previous literature has not consistently addressed. The thesis posits that whereas MySpace serves as a means for representation, Facebook is primarily a tool for group communication, and a recent migration from Facebook to MySpace reveals the importance of group membership and group connectivity to teen identity. In addition, the thesis finds the teens&apos; SNSs&apos; pages are reflections of identity that are in large part reactions to others&apos; perceptions of the identities displayed on profile pages, as well as attempts to reflect an &lt;italic&gt;authentic&lt;/italic&gt; identity. These concepts are particularly well represented by the idea of identity as &lt;italic&gt;bricolage&lt;/italic&gt;, the ongoing process of constructing and deconstructing, submitting and omitting, and organizing of mediated communication to present an online identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Evolution of Opioid/Orphanin Receptors in Chordates</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The interest in the opioid/orphanin gene family stems from functional similarities that these peptides have to the narcotic opium. Opiates have been extensively studied because of their analgesic properties; however, the reason that these plant products can affect the human central nervous system was a mystery until the discovery of opiate-like peptides. The endogenous opioid peptides are well understood today because they have been fully cloned and characterized in several different organisms including lower chordates. On the other hand, the opioid/orphanin receptors have not been fully cloned or characterized in lower chordates; therefore, to better understand the past and present evolutionary path of the opioid/orphanin gene family it is important to have opioid receptor sequence information available over a broad taxonomic scale in lower chordates. This study reveals opioid/orphanin receptor sequence from Petromyzon marinus (lamprey), Heterodontus francisci (horn shark), and Acipenser transmontanus (white sturgeon). This sequence information exposed the conservation of critical amino acids within the opioid binding pocket and disulfide bridge, uncovered the possibility of crucial amino acids involved in ligand selectivity, and offered a proposed hypothesis for the evolutionary relationship between the four opioid/orphanin receptors.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Small businesses are key drivers in the world&apos;s leading economies.  Russia on the whole is lagging behind the developed world in terms of small businesses per capita.  Entrepreneurship gradually took shape after the collapse of the Soviet Union despite structural challenges.  A discourse on small business reform emerged during the presidency of Vladimir Putin.  Legislation passed during his tenure illustrates the evolution of reform in specific areas that affect small business.  Surveys show that perceived challenges for small businesses have also evolved.  As central control recedes, regional and local authorities will ultimately be responsible for the future of small business reform in Russia.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With the advent of nano technology, materials have been developed that can be applied to high performance concrete mix designs.  Nano silica reacts with calcium hydroxide (CH) to develop more of the strength carrying structure of cement: calcium silica hydrate (CSH).  In this paper, relationships have been developed to distinguish the benefits when using different sizes of nano silica in cement paste.  An extensive regime of experimental analysis was carried out to determine the effect of nano silica.  Through these experiments the heat of hydration of multiple cement mix designs was measured.  After that, the concentration of CH was recorded through X-ray diffraction.  Then, the grain structures were examined through scanning electron microscopy.  Finally, the compressive strength was determined for each cement paste mixture.  Through these experiments it was found that as the silica particles decreased in size and their size distribution broadened, the CSHs became more rigid; this increased the compressive strength.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The following document is a report submitted in conjunction with a video project.  The video is a personal documentary, filmed in Denver, Colorado and Mexico City, Mexico, which explores the spiritual connection that people have with their material objects.  The report is comprised of a project proposal and a post-production report.  The proposal discusses the theoretical underpinnings of the project, and offers a plan for the film&apos;s production.  The post-production report discusses my filmmaking process in retrospect, reviews production problems and solutions, and includes a final schedule and budget.Please visit my website at http://www.upupintothesky.com, or contact the author at interestingrandomness(at)gmail.com, for a current link to a video stream of the film which accompanies this paper.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Contact programs, such as Seeds of Peace, subscribe to the assertion that an essential element to co-existence between groups with a violent history is to provide situations in which out-group members are encouraged to form new relationships. Although the individual may have positive feelings toward out-group members at the conclusion of the program, he or she must return home to existing social networks, which may not hold the same tolerant attitudes. This research explores what happens when individuals present new out-group relationships to existing peer groups. Under what circumstances, if any, can participants sustain new relationships when they return to their respective communities where they face the pressures and constraints of their previousnetworks and neighborhoods?</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Transformation of Rebel Movements into Political Parties in Transitions from Civil Conflict: A Study of Rebels&apos; Decision-making Amid Violence in El Salvador and Zimbabwe</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Efforts to understand modern intrastate conflict require examination of the varied interactions between states and non–state entities battling for control of government. A growing number of civil wars and separatist conflicts, particularly following the end of the Cold War, have been resolved peacefully through negotiated settlements in which rebels abandoned their arms and entered the political arena. While many scholars have studied revolution and democratization in depth, few have focused on explaining the transformation of rebel movements into political parties. Under what conditions do rebel movements engaged in armed conflict with states decide to negotiate, disarm and participate in electoral politics? The analysis relies on historical narrative and process–tracing to uncover complex, interactive causal mechanisms beyond the purely rationalist motives of rebels and regimes.This qualitative study analyzes two revolutionary groups that transformed from violent combatants into political actors in transitions from civil wars—the ZANU/ZAPU movement in Zimbabwe and the FMLN in El Salvador. Three factors—a) the nature and extent of international influence on the rebels, b) the rebels‘ level of popular support and c) the type of electoral system are hypothesized to impact rebels&apos; decisions. The study examines the shifting mobilization strategies of violent revolutionary groups—and their effects—given particular material and non–material incentives and the interaction of the interests and identities of domestic and international actors in the civil war context. Building on the existing theoretical literature on social revolution, democratization and the participation of “outsiders” in electoral politics, the study of rebels‘ decision–making in civil wars is positioned firmly within scholarship on peace–building and political development.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Uncertain Identity: Medical Practitioners in Doctor Thorne and Middlemarch</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The medical practitioners who play leading roles in the novels Middlemarch by George Eliot and Doctor Thorne by Anthony Trollope are examples of a new breed of professional medical men that emerged during the middle of the nineteenth century in England. The new class of general practitioners held licenses from the old hierarchical system of physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, but they were the driving force in favor of reform and professionalization in medicine. The 1858 Medical Act was an important step on the path toward a new conception of the medical practitioner, and the development of that new medical identity opened the door for doctors as the principal characters in novels. Trollope&apos;s Thorne marks an intermediate conception of the doctor balanced between genteel tradition and professional reform, while Eliot&apos;s Lydgate embodies the new model of a medical protagonist whose personal flaws could be balanced by professional brilliance.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Bluff Great House is a Chaco-era monumental building, located in southeastern Utah. This site was inhabited from A.D. 700 to 1300, before and after the time when Chaco Canyon was widely considered a regional &quot;capital&quot;.  To map the Bluff site&apos;s architecture throughout its&apos; occupations, ground-penetrating radar data were collected for the site&apos;s encircling berm, plaza, terrace, and a pithouse. Excavation data were combined with ground-penetrating radar maps, which together allowed for a spatially extensive and more temporally complete understanding of the Bluff site&apos;s architecture. The findings of this research show that site had a series of long-term habitations, which provided a historical context for the great house. Also, the people living at the Bluff site were well connected to their region throughout its occupation. Altogether, there is little evidence from this research to suggest that the Bluff Great House was directly influenced by Chaco Canyon, but instead the great house architecture at Bluff may have been emulating many sites in the region in a style common to that time period.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The world is guaranteed a certain level of climate change due to the emissions already released into the atmosphere. Therefore, adaptation to climate change is necessary. Increases in diarrheal disease and malnutrition due to climate change are analyzed for Bangladesh. Relative risks determined by the World Health Organization, estimates obtained from agricultural models, and migration estimates are utilized to determine the costs associated with each of these diseases, as well as reductions in rice production and increases in urban migration. It is found that climate change will create additional costs for treating each of these diseases that equal .05% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), losses to rice production equal to 1.5705% of GDP, and increases in urban migration of 4.2%. Utilizing a vulnerability framework, adaptation policies are recommended that reduce societal vulnerability to these impacts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Throughout the religious history of American feminism, Jewish feminist biblical interpretation shifted attention away from Eve as a viable example of women&apos;s identities. Instead, Lilith, the independent, &quot;demon&quot; and &quot;first wife&quot; of Adam is praised as a symbol of female sexuality for &quot;Transformationist&quot; Jewish feminists. Re-claiming Lilith as the &quot;first Eve,&quot; &quot;Transformationist&quot; Jewish feminists turn scripture on its head. Eve&apos;s creation and her actions in Genesis are interpreted as a product of patriarchy and male dominance, while Lilith in the midrashic narrative, &lt;italic&gt;the Alphabet of Ben Sira&lt;/italic&gt;, is used by Jewish feminists to reclaim their identities on religious and spiritual levels.This thesis explores the history of &quot;Transformationist&quot; Jewish feminism to understand the methods by which scripture is interpreted, and ultimately arrive at new working interpretations of Genesis 1-3 and&lt;italic&gt;The Alphabet of Ben Sira&lt;/italic&gt;. This thesis&apos; significance lies in an exploration of Jewish feminism&apos;s ability to cross religious and gender boundaries.</dc:description>
