If upgrading this version of Blacklight (5.0.1) to another version, core files have been edited and may need to be updated manually, before 
before they may be used in any newer version.  Any changes to files for the DU project have been marked with a 'DU ' comment prefix.  All files 
in this repo should be able to be simply 'dropped' into their cooresponding folders in the new skeleton BL app to upgrade.

Core files that may need manual changes to complete an upgrade:

app/helpers/blacklight_helper_behavior.rb
