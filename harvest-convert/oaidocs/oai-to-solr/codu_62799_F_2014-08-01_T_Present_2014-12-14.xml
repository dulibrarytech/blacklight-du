  <dc:description>In my dissertation, I examine two main research questions: 1. Can we regard democracy as the new standard of civilization and the new wave expansion of international society in the post-Cold War era and in the 21st century? and 2. Should we think that each path toward democracy is relatively different based on the characteristics of each international society and the internal and external variables of each state? In my dissertation, I use typology to demonstrate that each country has taken its own unique path toward democracy, and that democracy has become the post-Cold War and 21st century new standard of civilization and new wave expansion of international society. A pluralist international society, a solidarist international society, and a liberal anti-pluralist international society have influenced paths toward democracy, along with institutions such as international law, diplomacy, Great Powers and international organizations. In addition to those, internal variables such as each country&apos;s history, culture, politics, economy, military power and foreign policy can also influence paths toward democracy. However, in my dissertation, I primarily focus on the characteristics of international society and institutions rather than internal variables in order to examine the different paths toward democracy. Case studies on countries such as China, South Korea, and Iraq can help demonstrate that each type of international society as well as external and internal variables can have an impact on paths toward democracy. In the case of China, democratization can be viewed in the context of interest-oriented socialization. In South Korea, it can be viewed as value-oriented socialization, and, finally, in Iraq, it can be viewed as the use of force. To conclude, democracy is gradually becoming the post-Cold War and 21st century new standard of civilization and new wave expansion of international society, and each country&apos;s path toward democracy is relatively different based on each circumstance.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Education policy has focused on teacher quality and student achievement since the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, which defined teacher quality in terms of teachers&apos; professional qualifications and certification. This is consistent with a history of econometric studies examining the effects of teacher background characteristics on student achievement. More recently, researchers have argued that investigations of teacher effectiveness should examine what actually happens in the classroom, and that teacher attitudes and instructional practices are conspicuously missing from the prior research. This study uses a two-phase parallel mixed methods design to explore teacher perceptions of the influence of their background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement. The first phase is a quantitative analysis using structural equation modeling and data from the Early-Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to examine the relative effects of teacher background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement. The second phase is a case study of an innovative elementary school meeting State expectations for student growth.  The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that teacher attitudes typically have a significant effect on student achievement, but teacher background characteristics and perceptions related to their instructional practices do not. The teachers in the case study agreed that teacher attitudes are important and are likely to have an effect on students, as well as on other teachers. However, the teachers in the case study also perceived that a number of instructional practices are crucial to increasing student achievement and closing achievement gaps.</dc:description>

      A collection of poems with critical preface. The author expresses concern for responsibilities and obligations resulting from utterance and offers a means of reading poetry in light of such concerns. Lyric theory and the legacy of Language poetry with regards to the lyric are loci in a discussion of contemporary poetics. It analyzes the work of poets Tomaz Salamun and Lyn Hejinian, in relation to theorists Theodor Adorno and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, to articulate a poetics specific to the poems in the collection. The poetics is described via the literary and anthropological uses of metaphor, which are employed to unify text, writer, and reader. The phenomenology of ritual and ritual theory address these contingents to conclude the preface. The collection of poems is divided into three sections, each a distinct, interrelated collection of poetic modes.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Explicit Finite Element Modeling of the Human Lumbar Spine</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Validated finite element (FE) models of the functional spinal unit (FSU) and lumbar spine are essential in design-phase device development and in assessing the mechanics associated with normal spine function and degenerative disc disease (DDD), as well as the impact of fusion and total disc replacement (TDR). Although experimental data from fully intact specimens can be used for model calibration and validation, the contributions from the individual structures (disc, facets, and ligaments) may be inappropriately distributed. Hence, creation of decompression conditions or device implantations that require structure removal may not have the proper resulting mechanics. An explicit FE formulation may be advantageous compared to standard analysis due to efficiency in handling complex, changing contact conditions and the ability to evaluate either rigid or deformable body contact. Also, probabilistic studies based on these deterministic FE formulations are of great interest currently as model input parameters (such as properties of nucleus, annulus, ligament stiffness and facet material and geometric orientation) have been characterized experimentally, but contain substantial variability. The use of these FE formulations is not only valuable from an intact spine point of view, but also relevant in understanding and improving the design outcome of procedures like the total disc replacement (TDR). It has been shown that clinical outcome and the incidence of adjacent level disease is linked to the range of motion achieved by the introduction of these disc replacement devices like the ProDisc-L (Synthes Spine, West Chester, PA). Placement of the spherical center of the device as close as possible to the anatomical axis of rotation of the segment is essential in achieving optimal performance.
      Accordingly, an explicit FE model of the lumbosacral spine and FSU&apos;s L2-L3 and L4-L5 using subject-specific in vitro data was developed using sequential transection of each structure. In addition, the objective of this dissertation was to develop a computationally efficient, probabilistic explicit FE model of the lumbar spine, to evaluate spine mechanics for the FSU&apos;s L2-L3 and L4-L5. This probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the capability of efficient probabilistic analyses to predict performance incorporating disc and ligament material variability as well as geometric variability of the facet joint. A well calibrated deterministic and probabilistic model can be used as an excellent computational tool to predict the behavior of the spine with implants like the ProDisc-L. This dissertation also investigates the effect of altering the position of the Prodisc-L implanted in a FE model on ROM during flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Specifically, ROM, bone impingement, implant impingement, and facet forces were evaluated with varying anterior-posterior and medial-lateral placement of the TDR implant.
      The uniqueness of this work is the method developed to tune the individual structures in calibrating the FE model using sequential sectioning. This strong calibration against subject-specific in vitro data developed confidence in the predictive power of this FE model. For an applied torque, the rotational root mean squared error between the model predictions and the experimental results were within 0.15deg averaged during flexion and extension. The probabilistic analysis compared some of the advanced reliability and probabilistic techniques with the Monte Carlo simulation which is considered the gold standard. The efficient methods accurately estimated the results from Monte Carlo simulation in approximately 5% of computational time. This study on the implanted spine performed on four different spine models showed the importance of using FE techniques as a pre-op templating tool in decision making process for spinal procedures.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Latino Family Involvement: An Exploratory Study of Latina Mother-Daughter Relationships and their Effects on Educational Attainment and Resiliency</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Latino family involvement is an important issue in the field of education. Effective strategies to promote family involvement in the Latino community are vital for the educational attainment of Latino students and emotional wellbeing of Latino families. This study used focus groups, in-depth interviews, and observations to examine Latino family involvement and the relationships and communication patterns between Latina mothers and daughters. The Latina mother-daughter relationship was studied in an effort to gain a better understanding of how this relationship affects a Latina daughter&apos;s educational attainment and sense of resiliency. Results indicated that a positive relationship between a Latina mother and daughter can increase a Latina daughter&apos;s level of educational attainment and sense of resiliency. Additionally, a Latina daughter&apos;s level of self-motivation can affect her level of educational attainment as well. Cultural narratives were found to be a common type of communication pattern used between Latina mothers and daughters. They were used to teach cultural values, life lessons, and experiential learning. By improving family involvement efforts within the Latino culture, Latino students will likely see drastic improvements in their overall levels of educational attainment and emotional wellbeing in schools. Implications for Latino students and families, schools that work with Latino families, and educational policy are also discussed.

  <dc:description>Drawing on Charles Taylor’s historical analysis in A Secular Age, this dissertation
reveals connections between the process of Euro-Western secularization and its roots in
the universalizing project of Christianity. This work asserts that religion, a term often
identified with Christianity, developed in conjunction with secularization and concludes
that these theoretical constructs influenced international legal principles which
marginalized indigenous cultures that did not conform to its tenets. Not only did
Christianity and the secular arise from the same roots, but both were shaped by
colonialism.This paper provides a detailed overview of the development of international
law as a colonial project that combined theological and secular interpretations of natural
law and the law of nations creating a vehicle for land acquisition and resource extraction
by examining the writings of Francisco de Vitoria, Hugo Grotius and John Locke. In
order to trace the effects of flows of power from religious authority to state authority, this
paper examines the views of Michel Foucault and Talal Asad on power, agency, identity
and freedom through the lens of religion and the secular. This project focuses on the
Native American experience to demonstrate the interface between Christian missionizing,
the imposition of discipline and civilization and the current American legal system that
asserts a separation of church and state.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>THE WEEK is a collection of short stories. These stories engage the
politicized (if not overly political) question of what it means to be human and to be in
relation to other humans in the world. Some of the stories are quite compressed; I
attempt to create effects in these pieces through subtraction, ellipsis, parataxis, and
surprise. Other stories are more sustained, producing voices that address the reader
directly or voices that follow the involutions of a thought, dwelling on minute details
of consciousness; these pieces play with conventional short story elements (character,
plot, rising action, falling action, etc.), although they often “fizzle” or turn sharply to
unsettle reader expectation. I have found that it is very difficult to be human. That
being human is a problem is both the premise and the conclusion of this book.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Early life stress is known to have an enduring impact on individuals’ health
trajectories, however, some show greater resiliency to early life stress than others. The
exploration of candidate genes and gene-environment interactions may be one promising
window on risk versus resilience trajectories. However, prior work involving three
polymorphisms (COMT Val158Met, MAOA-LPR, and 5-HTTLPR) has yielded well
publicized but inconsistently replicated associations with mental health. Part of this
inconsistency may be due to the limited exploration of mechanistic explanations for how
these gene-environment interactions lead to variations in health. Thus, this dissertation
examines gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in predicting basal cortisol at age
eight (assayed from a single blood sample). Data for this project comes from 813 families
participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Early environmental risk is characterized by three well-documented factors (maternal
depression, maternal stress exposure, and child stress exposure) compiled across the
developmentally salient 0-6 year age range. Contrary to expectation, genetic risk was not
related to children’s basal cortisol in middle childhood, and neither were the tested geneenvironment
interactions. Most measures of environmental risk were also unrelated to
children’s cortisol, however maternal stress exposure when the child was 48-61 months
old was related to higher basal cortisol. Analyses and discussion describe patterns of environmental risk exposure across early childhood in an effort to better characterize risk
trajectories in this sample. Although the current findings do not support HPA axis
dysregulation as a mechanism by which gene-environment interactions impact health,
methodological limitations likely contributed to these null findings. Future studies should
continue to explore such mechanistic explanations in order to create effective
interventions for children at high risk for stress related disease.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the last twenty years, researchers, theorists, and clinicians have begun to identify the personal toll on clinicians who work with traumatized clients. Mental health professionals may experience disruptions in their cognitive schema due to their clinical experiences. Clinicians may also struggle with depression, cynicism, alienation from friends and colleagues and an array of psychological and physical symptoms. While researchers have begun to explore how vicarious trauma manifests with clinical staff, there remains a need to identify interventions that are effective in mitigating vicarious trauma, burnout, and intent to leave.
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to investigate the relationship between levels of debriefing interventions and vicarious trauma, burnout, and intent to leave. To that end, a convergent parallel mixed methods design was used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data. The convergent parallel design is a triangulation design where data were collected concurrently using quantitative and qualitative methods. The results of this study addressed whether the debrief intervention is a viable intervention associated with rates of vicarious trauma, intent to leave, and burnout for mental health clinicians who work with children and adolescents with histories of trauma.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>My dissertation is entitled “My Education.” It is a poetic meditation on the nature
of knowledge. The manuscript is a triptych, each section of which corresponds to a
common source of knowledge.
The first chapter is a collection of poems entitled As Seen On TV. The poems
borrow conceptual metaphors and visual gestures from television programs in order to
investigate the values that produced them and norms that are produced by them. The
poems are concerned with mimesis: the troubled relationship between art and life.
Organized as a day spent in front the television, the book opens with the morning news,
and ends with late night reruns and static. These poems are about the passage of time, the
female body, and the violence of its rapid obsolescence.
The second chapter, “Boy Friends,” is an alphabetical primer on romance. The
alphabet contains the units of literacy, of knowledge. It is an organizational method. The
alphabet book is a didactic form; it teaches the order of things. In this work, the speaker
lists the men in her life alphabetically, describing her affairs and thwarted love interests,
beginning with Adam and ending with Zachary. The twenty-six lineated poems are
followed by a prose addendum entitled &quot;Roll Call,&quot; in which the speaker tries to list every
boy she ever met and explain what has become of him since she knew him. Many of the
names from “Boy Friends” recur here, and a sense of narrative develops and acts as a
bridge into the final chapter.
The third section, “Confessional Poetry,” is a collection of prose essays modeled
after the Roman Catholic Sacrament of Penance. In this work, I confess a sin to
correspond to each on the Ten Commandments. This numeric organization (1-10) mirrors
the alphabetical organization (A-Z) of “Boyfriends.” This is a work of spiritual
accounting. In it, I tally the wrongs I have done to see how it all adds up. Unfortunately I
am not very good at math. I do not know the final answer. I do know that each of these
stories is an act of contrition.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>P. sphinx teen is a novel and creative dissertation that can be classified as 
a descent narrative, or katabasis, employing various literary forms–––poems, short prose, essays, 
journal entries, interviews, and illustrations –––to tell one story: the death, from pneumonia, of 
my mother’s 15-year-old sister. Within the narrative, suggestions of origins are made as a way to 
affix the idea of a descent through generations and time. However, those origins are quickly set 
aside allowing the story to branch like a tree–––itself the shape of a simultaneous katabatic and 
anabatic narrative.
The originating story took place in Detroit, Michigan between 1935 and 1939, and is framed by others: Sigmund Freud’s collection of antiquities and its escape from Vienna in late 1938; the making of Charlotte Salomon’s opus Life? or Theatre?; Anais Nin’s simultaneous marriages; Walter Benjamin’s radio program called Enlightenment for Children. Motifs and characters are interchangeable passes for voices both distinct and indistinct. The author, at times, takes the form of an “I” lifting the life of her lineage to view and, with the suspicion of reincarnation, changing place with the main character, Patricia, who is, simultaneously, one and many. In researching the family story in relationship to historical events and figures associated with 
those events, I discovered an irregularity in record keeping that lead me to question whether my 
aunt had, in fact, died from pneumonia or something less natural.  Because the pertinent family 
members were dead, I turned, first, to a medical chart that my grandmother kept as she tended to 
her sick daughter constructing a series of horary astrological charts that were then interpreted by 
four paranormal industrialists with astonishing results.
P. sphinx teen attempts to manifest the lawless nature of grief as a thumbing of one’s nose at 
those who would have it otherwise or who would make of mourning something compact and manageable. 
It is a book of many voices, ghost-driven, and made equally uncanny by human ineptitude, 
wickedness, and grace.

  <dc:description>This manuscript is an effort to determine the world and how we are to each other. It is also an effort to come into meaning. How imagination is part of that. The escape here has to do with the inability to make things mean—it feels like if I try hard enough there can be a resolution via the imagination. But sometimes when we make things they overcome us. It’s difficult to know the appropriate boundary for imagination—at what point it moves from an attempt to decipher the world into a construction of the reality of the world. I can’t ever tell the difference but I continue to try. Some of what went into this manuscript has is the thinking about neuroscience (neurotheology). My interest in perceptions of reality and what can be obtained from a negotiation of those perceptions leads itself easily into research of the brain: What information is available to us though the technological investigation of brain and what can be determined from research regarding how consciousness is discussed physiologically. Much of the current research in the neuroscience community is occupied with the placement and location of consciousness and self. My own interest within these considerations is centered in the nature of self, place and imagination, and how the correspondence between these given fields of activity allow us to make decisions about what we understand as the world and ultimately how we determine it.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Achieving effective learning via digital media continues to be a major concern in contemporary education. The daily use of all forms of digital media is part of our lives and therefore becomes a key component of education. Educators must consider the process of digital media curriculum as a learning model and form of experience adapted to education. This means the significance is on how to learn as well as what to learn. This study demonstrated how the implementation of digital media curriculum via the Scratch game-making project contributed to middle school students&apos; interaction with the entire educational process. The goal was to rethink the role of digital media in transforming schooling. Based on classroom observation and interviews with the teachers and students from four middle schools in Denver, Colorado, the qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship was employed to examine the use of digital media and the interaction between teaching and learning. Several themes emerged: (a) The production of digital media influenced students&apos; behavior and educators&apos; attitudes towards formal and informal learning; (b) digital citizenship is a substantial lesson in the course of digital learning and an understanding of the digital framework of society; (c) new literacy is critical, because ever-changing equipment supporting the digital experience provides dynamic and contrasting ways of connecting with society; (d) the reward of learning is by doing versus being told, and deeper learning is attained by students&apos; interacting with their own work; and (e) digital media programs, such as making video games for learning, provide students skills in communication, theoretical, aesthetic, creativity, and technical knowledge necessary for becoming successful digital citizens. The research revealed students&apos; enjoyment and effort in this new form of learning experience, which enhanced their critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity under teachers&apos; well-planned guidance. The challenge for educators is to constantly review and design educational approaches supporting students towards using the tools meaningfully and within a defined learning experience, continuing to help students become active participants and authors of their own identity and creativity. Educators need to find the best usage of digital media technology, providing students every advantage towards reaching an informed global perspective.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The inequities in learning between the rich and the poor have become pervasive in United States. This is evidenced by the high school graduation rates, college attendance percentages, and employment statistics. Upon another wave of reform, the Common Core State Standards in mathematics are currently being adopted in hopes of increasing learning for all students, with a focus on college and career readiness.   This study is intent on finding ways to remedy the inequities in mathematics between the high income and low income schools by focusing on one of the great glass ceilings to high school graduation and beyond, high school Algebra I.  This study gives examples of how successful teachers are providing opportunities for learning Algebra I despite barriers that students, administrators, and policy-makers deliver in low-income schools amidst the latest reform movement. The researcher provides a portrait of how three different algebra teachers in three different low-income high schools, in the same city in Colorado, teach within the confines of various reform mandates to meet the diverse needs of their students. The research was conducted with a particular focus on the classroom management strategies, student engagement strategies, culturally relevant pedagogy, and caring relationships contributed to the learning in these classrooms. Using observations, teacher interviews, and student interviews, the researcher employs the method of Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship to answer the research question. The question that guided this study was: What practices do effective algebra teachers employ in high poverty, diverse high school algebra classrooms to implement the curriculum and influence student learning? This question was supported by the sub-questions: (a) What classroom management strategies contribute to student learning?; (b) Which teaching strategies contribute to student engagement?; (c) Which culturally relevant pedagogy practices contribute to students&apos; opportunity to learn?; (d) How do relationships in the classroom support students&apos; opportunities to learn?; and (e) How are classroom management strategies, engagement strategies, culturally relevant pedagogy, and caring relationships intertwined in classrooms today? The findings of this study provide a stark warning to overly prescribed curricula and pedagogy, along with the heightened use of standardized tests tied to teacher evaluation. Answering the primary question using Eisner&apos;s (1998) dimensions of schooling and Uhrmacher&apos;s administrative dimension, paints a bleak picture for low-income schools under the current movement for accountability using student test scores. The negative consequences of a punitive administrative oversight on the teaching and learning of students paints a depressing scene for low-income schools. Conversely, the efforts of teachers to provide classroom management and student engagement supported by culturally relevant practices and caring relationships give a picture of hope if we focus on supporting and keeping in the schools that need them the most.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Education policy has focused on teacher quality and student achievement since the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, which defined teacher quality in terms of teachers&apos; professional qualifications and certification.  This is consistent with a history of econometric studies examining the effects of teacher background characteristics on student achievement.  More recently, researchers have argued that investigations of teacher effectiveness should examine what actually happens in the classroom, and that teacher attitudes and instructional practices are conspicuously missing from the prior research.This study uses a two-phase parallel mixed methods design to explore teacher perceptions of the influence of their background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement.  The first phase is a quantitative analysis using structural equation modeling and data from the Early-Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to examine the relative effects of teacher background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement.  The second phase is a case study of an innovative elementary school meeting State expectations for student growth.The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that teacher attitudes typically have a significant effect on student achievement, but teacher background characteristics and perceptions related to their instructional practices do not.  The teachers in the case study agreed that teacher attitudes are important and are likely to have an effect on students, as well as on other teachers.  However, the teachers in the case study also perceived that a number of instructional practices are crucial to increasing student achievement and closing achievement gaps.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the relationships between three important cultural factors—acculturation, self-disclosure, and gender— and Korean American adolescents’ attitudes and expectations about group counseling. In addition, the relationships between two of these factors−acculturation and self-disclosure, and Korean parents’ expectations and attitudes about group counseling as a potential treatment modality for their adolescents were examined. Ninety-three Korean high school students who attended 9 private afterschool programs provided by the Korean Institute of Southern California (KISC) in the Los Angeles area and their 93 corresponding Korean parents participated in the present study. For the student sample, the four subscales of the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (Integration, Assimilation, Separation, and Marginalization), the Self-Disclosure Questionnaire, and gender served as predictor variables, and the Group Therapy Survey was used as an outcome variable. The multiple regression results indicated that integration and assimilation significantly contributed to the prediction of Korean adolescents’ attitudes and expectations about group counseling, with the integration being the strongest predictor of the other modes of acculturation. Results also indicated that integration was correlated with Korean adolescents’ positive attitudes and expectations about group counseling, whereas assimilation was correlated with their negative attitudes and expectations about group counseling. The level of
iii
comfort with self-disclosure and gender were not significant predictors of group counseling expectations among the Korean adolescents. For the parent sample, five predictor variables (the four modes of acculturation and self-disclosure) were entered into another multiple regression model to investigate the impact of these variables on Korean parents’ expectations about group counseling for their adolescents. The results indicated that integration and self-disclosure were significant predictors of the parents’ expectations about group counseling. Implications and limitations of the present study, and directions for future research are discussed. Additionally, some recommendations for school counselors who work with Korean students and their families are presented in Chapter 5.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore principals&apos; perspectives on how they make sense of their leadership roles in a new pay-for-performance system. The study describes the perceptions of six principals, two each from elementary, middle, and high school levels, regarding leadership in a recently changed system. Principals were asked about their leadership roles in implementing a pay-for-performance system, and responses focused on leadership styles, actions, beliefs, preparation, and experience of leading in a time of change. Four themes emerged from the data as significant aspects of leading change in a pay-for-performance system: (a) supporting a culture of excellence, (b) leading through sense making, (c) maintaining balance, and (d) providing instructional leadership.The theme of &quot;culture of excellence&quot; refers to the standpoint of preparing students for higher learning expectations. Participants discussed creating a &quot;high culture of excellence&quot; as setting a sense of urgency for learning. Principals&apos; responses were generally about how to set the stage to prepare students for learning. However, there was an underlying message that leaders must be able to establish a climate for learning by involving people throughout the process. The theme of &quot;leading through sense-making&quot; includes ideas that the leader needs to be able to make sense of a changing system for self and others, understand the significance of the change, and work actively with others as a change agent. The theme of &quot;maintaining balance&quot; describes participants&apos; feelings that money is not the sole motivation factor for teachers in a pay-for-performance system; it is more important to find the right balance of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Maintaining balance includes finding the right staff members, providing the right level of support, and balancing rewards for good teaching. Finally, the theme of &quot;providing instructional leadership&quot; focuses on the principal as a master of instructional practices. All of the participants felt that the most important role as a principal in a pay-for-performance system is to be an active instructional coach for their teaching staff. To foster improvement of teacher performance, the principal needs to provide instructional coaching and feedback, create a team atmosphere, and make regular visits to classrooms to establish a climate focused on improvement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Test accommodations are designed to ensure the comparability of test scores between students and their typically developing counterparts by eliminating as much construct-irrelevant variance and construct-irrelevant difficulty as possible. Although those involved in test creation endeavor to create tests with suitable accommodations for students with disabilities, there is lack of consensus regarding accommodation efficacy. Using meta-analysis and meta-regression to summarize previous research, this study examined whether test accommodations differentially boost test scores of students with disabilities, and whether accommodated conditions provided a more effective and valid assessment of students with disabilities. Results from the meta-analysis of 34 studies (119 effect sizes) lend support to the differential boost hypotheses, whereby students with disabilities (mean effect size  = 0.30, k = 62, p &lt; 0.001) are positively impacted by test accommodations while their typically developing peers (mean effect size = 0.17, k = 57, p &lt; 0.001) gain little from test accommodations.Presentation assessment accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.22, k = 41, p &lt; 0.001) had a small statistically significant impact on the performance of students with disabilities, while use of timing/scheduling accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.47, k = 17, p &lt; 0.001) had a small, bordering on medium, statistically significant impact on these students. The effect for presentation accommodations intensified when narrowing the focus to students with learning disabilities (mean effect size  = 0.36, k = 23, p &lt; 0.001) but not for timing/scheduling accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.48, k = 13, p &lt; 0.001). Overall results for setting (k = 1) and response (k = 3) accommodations were not available as there were too few studies for an overall comparison.The results of meta-regression analyses examining the effects of assessment accommodations on test scores for students with disabilities showed that 42% of the heterogeneity in test score could be explained by an overall model examining population description, test characteristic, results dissemination, and researcher-manipulated (test accommodation effect size for students with disabilities) variables. Population description and test characteristic variable sets explained the greatest amounts of variability for mean increase in test score, R2=0.22 and R2 =0.35 respectively; researcher-manipulated variable (test accommodation) and research dissemination explained little variance, R2 =0.07 and R2 =0.01, respectively.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation is the result of a series of studies involving hot press lamination of inverted organic photovoltaics.  It first gives background and develops a lamination process for fabrication.  Then, the process is used to answer fundamental questions about organic photovoltaics and to fabricate previously impossible or overly complicated devices.  Finally, the author examines the scientific theory which describes the process and aligns that theory with related measurements.The field of organic photovoltaics is introduced and the lamination process is developed and optimized.  In the lamination process, part of the solar cell is deposited onto a rigid substrate, and the rest is deposited onto a flexible one.  The two substrates are pressed together under heat to complete the device.  Laminated devices are shown to perform as well or better than those made with standard fabrication methods, and the process shows benefits to both large scale production and scientific exploration of OPV devices.The lamination process is then used to answer physical questions and solve problems related to OPV.  After diversifying the procedure to include lamination at either the electron or hole contact, a series of semitransparent electrode materials are integrated into devices.  These materials are difficult or impossible to integrate into inverted devices without lamination.  Then bare metal contacts are pretreated and laminated into devices in order to investigate the mechanisms for time evolution in inverted devices.  Finally, two active layers are laminated to make a tandem device.  It is shown that the performance of the tandem is limited not by the procedure, but by the materials used in the interconnect layer between the two subcells.An investigation is performed that explores the physics behind the basis of lamination: adhesion.  Different mechanisms of adhesion are proposed, and calculations of adhesion forces based on known materials properties are made.  The resulting range of calculated forces is quite large, but within the range of measured values for adhesion force.  A general picture of the physics involved in lamination processes and their adhesion forces emerges.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Multiple incidents of postsecondary school shooting violence have occurred in American society--prompting concern about safety on college campuses, administrators&apos; roles in prevention, and proactive and responsible bystander actions.  Active shooter plans have become more established in educational environments, with efforts are directed toward both the perpetrator and the victims.  Limited information, however, has been provided regarding how bystanders would, or even should, construe and characterize their roles in such incidents.  Numerous professional and governmental researchers in organizations throughout the United States (e.g., the Center for Disease Control Injury Center, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, National Consortium on Violence Research-Carnegie Mellon University, and the Violence Prevention Research Program-University of California, Davis) have identified that prevention remains the best action.  The American Colleges Health Association (ACHA) leaders asked postsecondary educational institutions&apos; leaders to become engaged more actively in prevention efforts. In the current study, the researcher&apos;s own reconditioned hermeneutic design was used to examine appropriate bystander action during an incident of school shooting violence based on an Adapted Social Systems Model.  Internal and external socioeconomic factors with influence on student bystander action were addressed.  School administrators might find insight from the findings, implications, and future directions for research as discussed.  The results include a framework for the development of the ARISE bystander action model, a school violence ecological model in which the student bystander is placed in the center.  The ARISE model might be used as an action strategy for postsecondary institutions with a multidisciplinary approach to informing new policies and procedures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), a rapidly growing group of neurodevelopmental disorders, affect nearly all aspects of development. The knowledge base of ASDs has increased significantly over the past half century due to translational research models (Rutter, 1999). Basic science and applied clinical work have informed research in a bi-directional manner. Through these models, much is now known about the language, behavioral, and cognitive difficulties associated with ASDs. However, autism research would benefit from further delineation of the differences between ASD types through the development of behavioral phenotypes. Behavioral phenotypes are expressions of particular aspects of disorders that may aid in further differentiation of subtypes of disorders (Hoddapp &amp; Dykens, 1997).In particular, little is known about math achievement and math interventions for students with ASDs. Despite federal mandates (IDEIA, 2004; NCLB, 2001) that strive to ensure that students with disabilities are held to the same high academic standards as other students, the research base on math interventions for students with ASDs is inadequate (Minshew, Sweeny, Bauman, &amp; Webb, 2005). ST Math, a computerized, pictorially-based math intervention contains many features that support the strengths of students with ASDs.To better understand the effect ST Math might have on the math achievement of students with ASDs, 10 students from a private school in Denver, Colorado participated in the ST Math program over the course of one school year. Individual behavioral phenotypes were developed for these students, based on information obtained from Individual Education Plans (IEPs). A combination of comparative and single-case analyses approaches were used to examine the effectiveness of ST Math for students with ASDs. As a whole, students performed better on post-ST Math assessments, compared to pre-ST Math assessments. Three students completed ST Math consistently and regularly, allowing for the use of Concomitant Time Series Analysis to examine the temporal dynamics between time on task and percentage of items answered correctly. Two of the three students showed significant, positive relationships between time on task and percentage of items answered correctly. Commonalities in the behavioral phenotypes of students who successfully participated in ST Math are compared to the behavioral phenotypes of students who did not. Implications for current practice and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Responses to Domestic Violence Public Service Ads: Memory, Attitudes, Affect, and Individual Differences</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Public service ads (PSAs) are an increasingly visible part of efforts to decrease the occurrence and consequences of domestic violence. Like other advertising, domestic violence PSAs are designed to grab attention, influence attitudes, and enhance memory for ad content. Over the years, images in domestic violence PSAs have changed substantially; agencies have started using pictures that generate emotions - either vivid negative images (bruised faces or body parts), or positive images (smiling faces) that contrast with the negative text. It is not clear, however, how different types of ad images influence memory for the message and attitudes about domestic violence, and what role affect may play in such responses. Moreover, the extent to which individual differences (trauma history, posttraumatic distress - PTSD symptoms) influence outcomes is not known. In three studies with undergraduate and community samples, using methods ranging from psychophysiology to self-report, the impact of images on attitudes and memory for ad content are investigated, also considering affect and individual differences. Results indicate graphic negative images enhanced memory for ad content, are rated as more persuasive, and are more likely to compel the viewer to act. Affective responses to ads also differed based on image type, and in some cases, partially mediated the relationship between ads and outcomes. Trends in the data suggest further study of the role of individual differences (trauma history, PTSD symptoms) is needed. This research provides information specifically relevant to the design of domestic violence public service campaigns and broadly relevant to understanding the role of emotional responses and individual differences on outcomes associated with public service ads.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Utilizing textual analysis and in-depth interviews of self-identified Christian participants ages 18-35 (n=20), this dissertation explores the way Comedy Central&apos;s &lt;italic&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/italic&gt; portrays Christianity, how young Christian viewers negotiate their religio-political identity in relation to the show, and what this negotiation says about the religio-political landscape of Christian emerging adults (19-29) (Arnett, 2004) in the United States. I conclude that &lt;italic&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/italic&gt; provides a contextual occasion for critical religio-political reflection, and that Christian emerging adults of myriad Christian subcultures negotiate their religio-political identity in relation to &lt;italic&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/italic&gt; to varying degrees as they select differing reference points within the show as a means of shaping and strengthening previous and ongoing identity markers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The physical environment of the classroom impacts teachers and students. In many settings teachers are given some autonomy but little guidance in the establishment of the physical environment of the classroom.  Relatively few studies examine issues related to the totality of the physical environment of the classroom. This study is intended to provide a bridge between multiple disciplines and classroom application by describing and interpreting the intentions and decision making process of three teachers in the establishment of the physical environment of their classrooms.The five questions that guided this study focused on intentions of the teacher related to the physical environment, her/his philosophical and pedagogical beliefs, if the intentions were realized (or not) within the practice; impact of physical environment on teaching practice and the significance of examining the relationship between the physical environment of the classroom and the teacher&apos;s values and intentions.The methodology utilized for this study is Educational Connoisseurship and Criticism. This investigation provides detailed descriptions and interpretation of the experiences of three classroom teachers in vastly different school sites. Data collection includes multiple observations, interviews and artifact review.Several key findings emerged: 1) Teacher intentions for the physical environment to of the classroom were influenced by personal experiences and educational beliefs, 2) There is a symbiotic relationship between the physical environment of the classroom and the other dimensions of the classroom including curriculum offerings, instructional strategies and pedagogical techniques, classroom structure and organizational systems 3) Architectural elements exerted force over several of Eisner&apos;s dimensions of school including teacher intentions, and 4) the teacher&apos;s view of the flexibility of the space impacted both intention and use of the physical environment.This study has a variety of implications within the field of education as well as across disciplines. Implications from this study impact teacher education programs, practicing school administrators and planners, the school reform movement as schools with specific philosophies seek to create environments which support their mission and cross-disciplinary issues related to building design and planning, school furnishing design, lighting and color theory, and environmental hazard and impact.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Withholding Political Authority: Civil Society and People&apos;s Power in Zimbabwe</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The relationship of civil society to the state is rarely antagonistic and at most times supportive. The political regime and civil society are taken to be interdependent social structures that interact through hegemonic, supportive and socially constructed dimensions. Given this interdependency, when does civil society challenge authority or does its efforts rise to the level of a people&apos;s power revolution? When does it act to dismantle the political regime or seek to reconstruct it? This project attempts to shed light on how civil society mobilizes a people&apos;s power capable of challenging political authority through the story of its ongoing struggles to pursue social objectives in Zimbabwe in the 1990s.Since 1980, the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) controlled the only post-colonial government Zimbabwe has known. Drawing from its revolutionary credentials it set out to finish the interrupted war for Zimbabwean Independence. This objective resonated with civil society less and less over time as groups began to see Zanu&apos;s promises as hollow and its corruption and patronage systems as the primary obstacle in accomplishing their objectives. This development is explored through a grassroots empowerment movement, the Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress, the widespread protests in 1997 catalyzed by the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions and the efforts to rebuild the constitutional order spearheaded by the National Constitutional Assembly.The story points to at least three civil society strategies to locate power within the people and counter political power: 1) constructing political alternatives within the existing regime, 2) mass withdrawal of support for the authority of the regime and 3) reconstruction of the social contract. Nevertheless, civil society did not succeed in dismantling the political regime, hampered by the continuing capacity of the state to exert hegemonic control, remove the pillars of civil society support and exploit polarized values within civil society.Despite the terrible destruction of social and economic fabric of the country by the political struggles of the 2000s, the ongoing development of democratic values and the diminishing importance of the interrupted revolution can provide a glimmer of hope for the future transformation of the country.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The phrase cooperative learning refers to a pedagogical learning and teaching technique in use in schools from kindergarten through higher education.  The technique involves the structuring of an active classroom environment with students working in groups to discover, solve, and at its basic, provide a framework for dialogue and conversation.  Cooperative learning is grounded in the development of a theory of social interdependence (Morton Deutsch) which states that individuals, working in groups, can in most cases provide for greater productivity and ideas than individuals working alone.  The development of cooperative learning was greatly expanded in the late 1960&apos;s and early 1970&apos;s with the invention of specific group learning techniques led by researchers David and Robert Johnson (Learning Together), Elliot Aronson (Jigsaw), and Robert Slavin (STAD).  These researchers established guidelines (rules) and taxonomies that provided a basis for research in the area of cooperative learning.  At the center of all of these techniques is an element of human communication, most often through the oral/aural communication channel, where group learning and discovery takes place.Cooperative learning and collaborative learning techniques differ in the amount andimplementation of teaching guidelines required in the methodology.  This study (a meta-analysis) weaves through more than 14-hundred published pieces of literature in a varietyof disciplines, narrowing it down to 19 published articles which investigate (through experiments) the effectiveness through learning outcomes of cooperative learning in higher education (college and university level).With studies including more than 2-thousand student-participants in the research, data indicates no significant difference between those classrooms utilizing a cooperative learning format, and those using a traditional lecture/discussion format (d =0.05, 95%, C1:-05 to .14, p&gt;.05, k = 21, N = 2,052).  Though there is no statistical difference between the two teaching techniques, researchers do offer a list of positive classroom observations/variables, which provides a launching point for future research into the use of cooperative learning techniques in higher education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study examined MMPI-2 data of 377 missionary candidates who presented for psychological assessment at Missionary Care Services. The purpose of the study was to establish a normative profile for missionary candidates to enhance interpretive validity and reduce missionary attrition. Mean T scores were established for the missionary candidate sample on the F, L, and K validity scales and the ten Clinical Scales. Analyses were conducted to compare the mean T scores of the missionary candidate sample to the mean T scores of the nonclinical normative population of persons taking the MMPI-2 for employment purposes. For both males and females, 10 of the 13 scales analyzed were significantly different from the nonclinical normative population. Results indicated that caution is suggested in interpreting the K scale. Further implications for increasing interpretive validity are discussed. Analyses were conducted to assess trends for MMPI-2 profiles of the missionary candidate sample over time. Results indicated that the mean T score on the K Scale for candidates tested between 1992 and 2002 was significantly higher than the mean T scores for candidates tested between 2003 and 2006 and candidates tested between 2007 and 2010. Analyses were conducted to assess trends by date of birth. Results indicated that the mean T score on the K Scale for Generation Y candidates was significantly lower than the mean T scores for Baby Boomer and Generation X candidates. Results also indicated that the mean T score on Scale 1 for Baby Boomer candidates was significantly higher than the mean T score for Generation Y candidates. Implications of analyses by date of testing and date of birth for the missionary candidate assessment process are discussed. Future research is needed to further enhance the quality of the missionary candidate assessment process.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this dissertation we study the Cayley-Dickson loops, multiplicative structures arising from the standard Cayley-Dickson doubling process. More precisely, the Cayley-Dickson loop Qn is the multiplicative closure of basic elements of the algebra constructed by n applications of the doubling process (the first few examples of such algebras are real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, sedenions). Starting at the octonions, Cayley-Dickson algebras and loops become nonassociative, which presents a significant challenge in their study.We describe basic properties of the Cayley-Dickson loops Qn, e.g., inverses, conjugates, orders of elements, and diassociativity. We discuss some important subloops of Qn, for instance, associator subloop, derived subloop, nuclei, center, and show that Qn areHamiltonian. We show that all subloops of Qn of order 16 fall into two isomorphism classes, in particular, any such subloop is either isomorphic to the octonion loop, or the quasioctonion loop. We discuss automorphism groups, inner mapping groups, and multiplication groups of the Cayley-Dickson loops, and describe the progress made on the study of their subloop structure. We also provide incidence tetrahedra for the sedenion loop and other subloops of order 32, generalizing the idea of the octonion multiplication Fano plane.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Mentoring provides personal support, academic assistance and career guidance to college students of color whose experiences have been documented to be very different from those of their White counterparts. Achievement inequity, problems of persistence, experiences of racism and student reports of feeling marginalized and misunderstood threaten the ability of students of color to succeed in college. While it may be assumed that race plays a central role in the mentoring relationships of students of color, this assumption may be misguided.  The existence of formal mentoring programs and informal mentoring relationships that support students of color does not necessarily ensure that the confounded issue of race is appropriately embedded as a shaping force in the mentor/mentee association. This paper will deconstruct the assumption that approaches to the mentoring of students of color automatically consider race by applying Critical Race Theory as a theoretical framework to examine if and how race is present in the relationship between mentors and their African American student mentees at predominantly White institutions of higher education. Using phenomenological research design, this study brings race out of the rhetoric of higher education and places it in the center of examination to uncover student perceptions of race and how it operates within the mentoring relationship to help us better understand how we ensure high quality mentoring can be actively applied in our efforts to support the success of college students of color.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Physical activity is important, and many adolescents are not meeting the recommendation that youth participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week (CDC, 2011). Physical inactivity among middle school students is on the rise and may be a contributing factor to a decline in academic performance. Prior research has focused  primarily on bodily health; however, growing evidence supports the benefits of physical activity for academic achievement (Chomitz et al., 2009). This  study  examined the relationship between middle school students&apos; perceptions of physical activity and student engagement they relate to academic achievement among 179 middle school students in one suburban middle school. Additionally, this study sought to investigate  students&apos; perceptions of physical activity as well as the context within which these perceptions take place, which may lead to more effective strategies to help improve academic achievement. Propositions from Bronfenbrenner&apos;s ecological theory were used to examine the different factors influencing the relationship between middle school students&apos; perceptions of physical activity and student engagement as they relate to academic achievement.This study is predominantly a correlational and regression design, which examines relationships and predictive ability of key variables. This research design will add depth to the study by investigating the social influences in schools regarding the relationship between physical activity, student engagement, and academic achievement</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Disrupting the deficit discourse on historically Black colleges and universities: An organizational identity case study of Philander Smith College</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines a historically Black institution of higher education as &quot;any historically Black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principle mission was, and is, the education of Black Americans.&quot; Today, there are approximately 105 HBCUs, more than half private, the rest public, and a few two-year institutions (Allen, Jewell, Griffin, &amp; Wolf, 2007). While currently only 14 percent of Black college students attend HBCUs, 70 percent of all Black doctors and dentists, 50 percent of all Black engineers and public school teachers, and 35 percent of all Black attorneys received their bachelor&apos;s degrees at an HBCU (Avery, 2009). Despite these notable statistics, leaders associated with HBCUs have felt insecure about their future since the 1950s for a variety of issues; namely low enrollments, low endowments, loss of accreditation, and severe decreases in fiscal resources (Avery, 2009).However, missing from the discourse is a discussion of which HBCUs are currently staying ahead of the national and higher education economic crises by implementing effective leadership and financial management strategies. The academic literature fails to explicitly highlight HBCUs that are not only surviving in these times of economic difficulty, but actually thriving and remaining credible and supportive institutions in the respective community.In an effort to go against the trend of only highlighting the myriad financial and accreditation issues plaguing HBCUs, this doctoral dissertation study will illuminate the ways in which these institutions are efficiently addressing such problems, and typically doing so with less fiscal resources than other institutions of higher education (Gates, 2010). Philander Smith College has consistently been referenced in the journalistic literature as one HBCU that is successfully navigating historical and current problems stemming from a lack of fiscal resources. An organizational identity case study of this institution will shed light on the effective leadership and fiscal management strategies being executed by HBCUs in the 21st century. The findings of this study result in the construction of a model of best operational and leadership practices. It is the author&apos;s hope that both models will be adaptable and useful for other HBCUs.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>IMPLICATING BITZER&apos;S RHETORICAL SITUATION IN COMPARATIVE AND NON-VIOLENT RHETORIC: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF THREE ECOFEMINIST MOVEMENTS FROM EAST TO WEST.</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In the study of social movement rhetoric, scholars often focus on movements based in Western nations, foregoing study of social change in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and other parts of the world. Similarly, the focus on non-violent rhetoric has also been lacking, despite its use by great leaders such as Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King. This dissertation contributes to the study of social change in a globalized world, by taking a comparative approach to non-violent rhetoric in three diverse case studies. As sub-areas, both comparative rhetoric and non-violent rhetoric require further deliberation due to the numerous debates concerning their meanings and approaches. Comparative and non-violent rhetoric are significant areas of study because they encourage mutual understanding by striving for common ground among people of different cultures, faith traditions, and political opinion. In this dissertation, I will demonstrate how Western and non-Western forms of social movement rhetoric complement each other to enhance our understanding of comparative rhetoric. I turn to both Western and non-Western ecofeminists to examine how the women optimize non-violent rhetoric, and the ways in which their cultural statushelp advance and/or hinder their activism. I specifically turn to the Chipko movement in India, Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, and Julia Butterfly Hill in the United States, for an in-depth understanding of non-violent rhetoric in direct action. I use rhetorical criticism and Bitzer&apos;s (1968) rhetorical situation, to analyze the exigency, audience, and constraints in the three case studies. I argue that Bitzer as a theoretical framework is broad enough to study a variety of cultures/situations; yet, it is sufficiently well-defined to allow for useful analysis. I also contend, non-violent rhetoric is a tactic and manifestation of a philosophy that aims to address exigencies, and amend the relationship of the adversary to an ally. Non-violent rhetoric does not only address the material conditions of a situation, but also incorporates the spiritual and/or religious as a mode of address. Including a spiritual/religious dimension in the study of social movements enhances our understanding of social movements beyond the instrumental.The case studies in this dissertation reveal that non-violent tactics are selected and practiced as they align with spiritual/moral/religious values. My analysis also demonstrates how non-violence is used in some cultures to counter irresponsible environmental practice in the name of &quot;development.&quot; Finally, I provide extended definitions for both comparative and non-violent rhetoric and suggestions for futureresearch.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the session-to-session change in symptom severity and social bonding ability in the participants of groups for survivors of sexual trauma. The concept of social bonding ability was addressed by examining the participants&apos; beliefs about the availability of social support, their beliefs about themselves, and their beliefs about their relationships with their group leaders. Group leader ratings of the level of process focus of their group were also measured. Twenty women between the ages of 19 and 55 receiving group treatment at three community agencies in Colorado were included in the study. Groups included in the study were either open or closed, were targeted at sexual trauma survivors and met for a minimum of 10 weeks. Assessment measures utilized included the Outcome Questionnaire 45 (OQ-45), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form Revised (WAI-SR), the Childhood Sexual Abuse Questionnaire (CSAQ), and the Sexual Experiences Survey Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV). Participants completed the SES-SFV, CSAQ, ISEL, WAI-SR, PCL-C and the OQ-45 prior to treatment. Participants also completed the OQ-45, WAI, and ISEL prior to each group therapy session for sessions two to 10, for a total of 10 weeks of data. Data were analyzed with profile analyses, hierarchical multiple regression, and paired sample t-tests. Results showed that there were significant pre to post treatment changes on all measures of symptom severity and bonding ability after 10 sessions of treatment.  There were significant differences in symptom severity based on ability to form social bonds. However, after controlling for pretreatment symptom severity, level of bonding ability was not a significant predictor of post treatment symptom severity. There were no significant differences in the ability to form social bonds over time based on level of process focus of the group and all groups including some amount of focus on process increased the ability to form social bonds. Regardless of level of process focus, group treatments produced significant increases in the ability to bond to the therapist over time. There were no significant differences in bonding ability or symptom severity between participants in the open and closed groups, and both groups experienced similar rates of reduction in symptoms over time. Overall, these findings suggest that brief group treatment for sexual trauma survivors may improve social bonding ability and decrease ratings of symptom severity. Also significant for sexual trauma group psychotherapy research is the ability for women to benefit from either open or closed group treatments. Further research on a larger scale is needed to learn how level of group process focus affect group members and how social bonding ability develops in psychotherapy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project was designed to develop the Corporate Safety Culture Scale, a unique measure of corporate safety culture that is supported by a strong theoretical foundation.  Items were developed conceptually, discussed in cognitive interviews, and submitted to expert review.  Survey items were administered to employees of a large public transportation organization.  Principle components analysis reduced the data and identified an empirical model.  The empirical model held two domains identified as: 1) &quot;Values,&quot; and 2) &quot;Behavior.&quot;  Confirmatory factor analysis compared the fit of the empirical model with that of a modified empirical model, and the hypothesized model, which held the following three domains: 1) &quot;Behavior,&quot; 2) &quot;Values,&quot; and 3) &quot;Meaning Systems.&quot; Goodness of fit indices (Chi-Squared, RMSEA, CFI, ECVI) identified the modified empirical structure as the model with best fit.   The similarities between the hypothesized and modified empirical models suggested that the CSCS carries strong theoretical support.The measure&apos;s reliability was tested using Cronbach&apos;s Alpha.  The full CSCS and each identified domain were shown to have strong Alpha values.  One-way between groups analysis of variance, was used to evaluate the relationship between scores on the full measure and a categorical safety behavior item.  Findings suggested that high scorers on the CSCS were safer workers than those with lower scores on the measure.  A post hoc analysis using Tukey&apos;s HSD showed that scores on the full CSCS, and the &quot;Behavior&quot; domain were significantly related to safety behavior.  The analysis of variance and the post hoc results indicated that a relationship exists between the CSCS and safety behavior.  This finding added to the validity of the measure.  The CSCS was shown to be a theoretically supported, valid and reliable measure that can be used to evaluate corporate safety culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>There is a dropout epidemic in the United States. In the US, 25% of high school students do not graduate on time. For Latinos, the number is worse, with only 64% graduating from high school. Current research is clear that 9th grade is a critical year for keeping students in school. Students that earn all their credits for their core classes in 9th grade are more likely to graduate than students who fail one or more class during their freshman year. Prior to this study, engagement has been connected to dropout in the literature, but with differing ideas of how to measure engagement. The Student School Engagement Measure (SSEM) could be one tool used to estimate levels of engagement and identify students at risk of dropping out. This study used structural equation modeling to identify whether 8th grade SSEM scores were a significant predictor of credits earned by the end of 9th grade. The results of this study indicated that 8th grade SSEM scores were not a significant predictor of credits earned at the end of 9th grade, supporting previous research has found that engagement changes from year to year. These findings suggest that measuring engagement over the course of a single year, instead of using the SSEM as a long term predictor, might be a more useful use of the SSEM.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL WATER SPLITTING FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION WITH METAL OXIDE (HEMATITE AND CUPRIC OXIDE) BASED PHOTOCATALYSTS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Solar hydrogen is one ideal energy source to replace fossil fuel, as it is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Solar hydrogen can be generated in a number of ways. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most promising methods for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. In this research project, metal oxide-based photocatalysts, especially hematite (&lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;Ñ-Fe2O3) and cupric oxide (CuO), were investigated for use as electrodes in PEC water splitting for solar hydrogen production.In our research project of hematite-based electrodes, we started with the incorporation of transition metal, particularly titanium (Ti), in hematite thin films to modify the valence and conduction band edges of hematite. We found that Ti impurities improve the electron conductivity of hematite and consequently lead to significantly enhanced photocurrents. We further investigated the Ti and Mg co-alloyed hematite. In this case, Ti is the donor and Mg is the acceptor in hematite. The co-alloying approach enhanced the solubility of Mg and Ti, which led to reduced electron effective mass and therefore increased electron mobility. Also, co-alloying tunes the carrier density and therefore allows the optimization of electrical conductivity. The densities of charged defects were found to be reduced, and therefore carrier recombinations were reduced. As a result, the Ti and Mg co-alloyed hematite thin films exhibited much improved performance in PEC water splitting as compared to pure hematite thin films.For the study of cupric oxide-based electrodes, we first investigated the possibility of reducing the electrode corrosion of cupric oxide in aqueous solutions by incorporating Ti as an electrode corrosion inhibitor. We found that Ti alloying can enhance the stability of cupric oxide in base solutions at the cost of reducing its crystallinity and optical absorption, and consequently lowering its photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. In order to balance the stability and the generated photocurrent, we developed a two-layer structure in which a thin layer of Cu-Ti-O was deposited on bare CuO thin film as a protective layer. Our experimental results indicated that this two-layer structure has an ideal thickness for the protection layer and is suitable for high-performance and long-term application for PEC water splitting.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study replicated and extended existing research on gratitude by examining the ways in which gratitude is related to both individual and relationship well-being. A total of 387 participants completed the pre assessment and were randomized into the study, with 251 participants completing the full study (i.e., pre, post, and follow-up assessments). Participants were randomly assigned to list relationship-focused gratitudes, amusing events, or general events that happened during their day for 14 days. The differential impact of the three interventions on both individual and relationship variables was investigated.  The relationship-focused and general events conditions experienced decreased negative affect from the pre to post assessment compared to the amusement condition. There were no other group differences. Participants across conditions experienced increases in life satisfaction, gratitude, and relationship confidence, as well as decreases in negative interaction. There also appeared to be short-term decreases in positive affect and positive connection for participants in all conditions. Changes in gratitude were associated with increases in relationship well-being. Additionally, cross-sectional analyses indicated that gratitude was associated with both individual and relationship well-being. Possible explanations for the lack of group differences as well as implications for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Wireless communication has experienced an incredible growth in the last decade. Two decades ago,the number of mobile subscribers was less than 1% of the world&apos;spopulation. As of 2011, the number of mobile subscribers has increased tremendously to 79.86% of the world&apos;s population.Robust and high-rate data transmission in mobile environments faces severe problemsdue to the time-variant channel conditions, multipath fading and shadow fading. Fading is the main limitation on wireless communication channels. Frequency selective interference and fading, such as multipath fading, is a bandwidth bottleneck in the &quot;last mile&quot; whichruns from the access point to the user. The &quot;last mile&quot; problemin wireless communication networks is caused by the environment of free space channels through which the signal propagates. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)is a promising modulation and multiplexing technique due to its robustness against multipath fading. Nevertheless, OFDM suffers from high Peak-to-Average- Power-Ratio (PAPR), which results in a complex OFDM signal. In this research, reduction of PAPR considering the out-of-band radiation and the regeneration of the time-domain signalpeaks caused by filtering has been studied and is presented. Our PAPR reduction was30% of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (IFDMA) utilizing Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and varying the roll-off factor. We show that pulse shaping does not affect the PAPR of Localized Frequency Division Multiple Access (LFDMA) as much as it affects the PAPR of IFDMA. Therefore, IFDMA has an important trade-off relationship between excess bandwidth and PAPR performance, since excess bandwidth increases as the roll-off factor increases.In addition, we studied a low complexity clipping scheme, applicable to IFDMA uplink and OFDM downlink systems for PAPR reduction. We show that the performance of the PAPRof the Interleaved-FDMA scheme is better than traditional OFDMA for the uplinktransmission system. Our reduction of PAPR is 53% when IFDMA is used instead ofOFDMA in the uplink direction. Furthermore, we also examined an important trade-off relationship between clipping distortion and quantization noise when the clipping schemeis used for OFDM downlink systems. Our results show a significant reduction in the PAPR and the out-of-band radiation caused by clipping for OFDM downlink transmission system.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Current approaches to the ministry of pastoral care and counseling in the South Indian context lack a serious grasp of the critical needs of survival, liberation and cultural identity of the Dalit Christian communities. Prevailing models of care that are individualistic and based on clerical hierarchy have failed to give adequate attention to the systemic, cultural and psychological dimensions of the contextual needs of the Dalit Christians and foster a shared understanding of their problems. The theological and cultural sources that inform the pastoral care practices are not indigenous to their context and therefore fail to provide a critical and constructive perspective on the needs that arise in the context of caste oppression.This study develops a communal contextual and intercultural approach to pastoral care and theology that is interdisciplinary in nature and informed by indigenous sources of knowledge, Dalit liberation theology as well as Latin American liberation psychology to respond to the contextual needs of the Dalit people. The communal contextual approach seeks to understand pastoral needs in their wider sociocultural and political contexts that include the realities of caste prejudice, patriarchy and sexism, among others. The communal contextual approach also expands the ministry of care from being the exclusive domain of the ordained clergy to include caring resources of the faith community, thereby affirming the collective subjectivity of the Dalit communities. The intercultural approach offers a framework not only for facilitating a healthy, constructive and respectful interaction with other cultures, but also for empowering marginal communities such as the Dalits. This approach encourages Dalits to resist the hegemonic nature of the dominant discourses while also affirming and privileging Dalit cultural perspectives and resources to build and strengthen Dalit cultural identity. As an intercultural approach, it pays particular attention to the power dynamics that come into play when two cultures interact. Dalit liberation theology provides the theological rationale and cornerstone for this communal contextual and intercultural approach to care. This theology is operationalized using strategies of intervention from narrative theory as conceptualized by Michael White and David Epston. This dissertation, written from a Dalit perspective, argues that this new model of pastoral care and theology creates new possibilities that theologically empower Dalits to not only to reimagine their `Dalitness&apos; by reclaiming their cultural heritage, but also to effectively address their critical issues of survival, liberation and developing a cultural identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The motivation for this work is the need to remove waste heat from laser diodes and high speed transistors in processes which are exponentially increasing past 1 kW/cm2 as anticipated by Moore&apos;s Law. The hypothesis guiding the work is that ultrasonic insonation of micro coolers employed to dissipate these heat loads can improve heat removal. It is thought that the mechanism promoting the benefit is enhancement of the ability of the coolant to remove latent heat in two-phase operation by managing entrained bubble size near the cooler&apos;s exit so as to forestall flow reduction or blockage caused by large bubbles, wedges and slugs accumulating there. Insonation experiments to prove the hypothesis have been done on several micro channel coolers in the range 4-80 kHz to quantify improvement in heat flux removal. In order to understand how insonation would produce benefit in heat removal, a research effort was undertaken to study the affect of 5-30 Pa acoustic fields on air bubbles rising in small aquariums. This involved developing a Faraday cage shielded acoustic probe, along with a force-beam calibration tool, for measuring field levels near a strongly electromagnetic-radiating ultrasonic source. Experiments were conducted on columns of pseudo monodisperse, sub-millimeter diameter air bubbles in water, and other fluids using bubble generators optimized for this purpose. A numerical analysis model based on energy balance of the acoustic work done on a bubble resulted in predicting mass transfer flux, and in quantifying bubble shrinkage and growth when irradiated on either side of its resonance. The model, and experiments show that bubble populations can be predictably altered by ultrasound. The research was concluded by identifying and quantifying micro channel cooler performance change when insonated in the range 4-80 kHz. It was discovered that 28 and 58 kHz radiation of exchangers having hydraulic diameters spanning 0.02 to 0.6 mm could produce heat flux removal improvements of 5 W/cm2 in devices normally removing less than 30 W/cm2, a factor of 17%. Peak thermal resistance improvement approaching 60 % has been observed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Informal kinship caregivers take on the responsibility of raising a relative&apos;s children in situations where those children cannot remain with their parents and are not in the custody of child welfare. The phenomenon is increasing, however it is difficult to obtain information from these families because of the difficulty locating them. As a result, there is limited research on this specific group of kinship care families. The purpose of this study was exploratory, using qualitative methods to gather information from informal kinship caregivers about their experiences caring for a relative&apos;s children with a focus on the rewards and challenges within those experiences. A second purpose was to enable participants to tell their stories so that information could be used by practitioners and policymakers. The 14 participants in this study described a path to informal kinship care that began with precipitating events that resulted in the children&apos;s not being able to live with their parents, followed by the decision to provide care, and then the quest to obtain legal custody of them. The caregivers next began a journey through the experiences of being informal kinship caregivers, which included both rewards and challenges. Four themes emerged to characterize those rewards and challenges: experiences with family, experiences with systems, financial experiences, and emotional experiences. Participants provided recommendations for both practitioners and policymakers, which included requests for more recognition and respect as well as more emotional, social, legal, and financial support. Despite all the difficulties, none of the participants regretted their decision to care for their relative&apos;s children.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explored several predictors of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) in a sample of 136 train employees. The first objective was to examine the influence of number of work related traumas, number of life traumas, age, personality characteristic extroversion, personality characteristic openness, social support, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping in the prediction of PTSD. The second objective was to assess the influence of number of work related traumas, number of life traumas, age, personality characteristic extroversion, personality characteristic openness, social support, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping prediction of PTG.Freight train employees from a major transportation company in the United States participated in the study. There has not been a thorough exploration of negative and positive outcomes of trauma in the literature with this population. The study attempted to gain further understanding of PTSD and PTG in train employees by using simple linear regression analyses to investigate number of traumas in predicting PTSD and PTG. The study then utilized hierarchical regression analyses to investigate how number of work related traumas, number of life traumas, age, personality characteristic extroversion, personality characteristic openness, social support, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping were related to PTSD and then in a separate regression using the same variables to predict PTG.Results of this study indicated that number of work traumas predicted PTSD, although number of work traumas did not predict PTG. Also, factors in the hierarchical model that were significant predictors of PTSD were number of work traumas, number of life traumas, negative cognitive coping, and positive cognitive coping.  In the model predicting PTG, social support, negative cognitive coping, and positive cognitive coping were statistically significant. The field of PTG is relatively young in comparison to the study of more pathological trauma, PTSD. Previous research has indicated personality factors, social support, and cognitive processing to have theoretical bases in the emergence of growth, and can also serve as protective factors for negative trauma reactions.  This is the first study to look at PTG in train employees and to also apply personality characteristics, social support, and cognitive coping. The results of the study provide evidence that social support, negative cognitive coping, and positive cognitive coping are related to PTG. Further, results indicated that number of work traumas, number of life traumas, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping predicted PTSD.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Communication researchers have much to gain and contribute by paying sustained attention to the implications, contributions, and consequences of the interpretation and (re)production of work as a calling. While work calling has been theoretically and quantitatively conceptualized in a number of disciplines, it remains lacking in evidence of how the lived experiences and sensemaking discourses of participants serve to (re)construct this concept. Thus, the current study is qualitatively guided by asking, how people from different professional domains communicate about their experiences of work as a calling. To begin, I assess the overarching themes related to work calling in the areas of organizational psychology, sociology, theology, and business. Second, I suggest that interweaving meaningful work, spiritual communication, and organizational rhetoric creates rich academic space for the study of work calling as a communicative concept. Third, using thematic analysis, I identify participant communication about work calling from twenty-nine interviews, informal observations, and artifact analysis. Three dominant themes emerged: (a) definitional markers, (b) inherent interaction, and (c) significant costs. The theme of definitional markers provides a conceptualizing basis for work calling, the theme of inherent interaction relates to the enactment of work calling, and the theme of significant costs describe potential consequences of this approach. From such discourse, work calling is revealed as a complex, constitutive, and contested term, providing promising avenues of research.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The character of state interaction matters. This dissertation quantifies this interaction from 1960-2001 and then forecasts it from 2010-2050. I contribute to the field of International Relations by improving traditional measures of Realism and Liberalism, quantifying new perspectives sensitive to cultural interaction, and statistically evaluating these indices relative to the occurrence of conflict. It is the first step in an academic research agenda that desires to expand the scope of possibility regarding the modeling of International Relations theory for the purpose of theory evaluation and policy analysis.This dissertation spans two fields of study that do not typically overlap:  International Relations and Integrated Assessment Modeling. I begin by laying a broad foundation to bridge this chasm. I do this by first exploring knowledge constraints associated with forecasting. This leads to an overview of my conceptual and empirical tool for calibrating my final model: the historic occurrence of international conflict. Next, I introduce conceptual and applied systems theory, which leads to an overview of the International Futures (IFs) model.I then explore Liberalism and Realism as they have been traditionally operationalized at the macro-level.  A newly quantified variable--referred to as the Cultures of Interaction Index-- is introduced that builds on Liberal notions and tries to explain some aspect of intersubjective norms and values operating in a dyad. I perform statistical analysis on these indices and show that using IR theories in conjunction explains more of the historic occurrence of conflict--and thus the character of state interaction--than using any theoretical tradition in isolation. I then endogenize Liberalism and Realism in IFs and use the cultural measure as an exogenous constant. I am interested in whether the stock of culture in a dyad and growth in Liberal notions of interdependence can off-set negative pressures arising from Realism.Most dyads improve their character of interaction to 2050, but some become more conflictual, including China - US and China - India. The analysis is extended by looking at long-term structural shifts in the global system:  depleted fossil fuel reserves, stressed fresh water availability and tension from domestic instability. I conclude by offering a series of next steps that builds upon this work and recommendations for policy planners concerned with the future of interstate relations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>As the potential emerging technology for next generation integrated resonant sensors and frequency references as well as electronic filters, micro-electro-mechanical resonators have attracted a lot of attention over the past decade. As a result, a wide variety of high frequency micro/nanoscale electromechanical resonators have recently been presented. MEMS resonators, as low-cost highly integrated and ultra-sensitive mass sensors, can potentially provide new opportunities and unprecedented capabilities in the area of mass sensing. Such devices can provide orders of magnitude higher mass sensitivity and resolution compared to Film Bulk Acoustic resonators (FBAR) or the conventional quartz and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonators due to their much smaller sizes and can be batch-fabricated and utilized in highly integrated large arrays at a very low cost.In this research, comprehensive experimental studies on the performance and durability of thermally actuated micromechanical resonant sensors with frequencies up to tens of MHz have been performed. The suitability and robustness of the devices have been demonstrated for mass sensing applications related to air-borne particles and organic gases.In addition, due to the internal thermo-electro-mechanical interactions, the active resonators can turn some of the consumed electronic power back into the mechanical structure and compensate for the mechanical losses. Therefore, such resonators can provide self-sustained-oscillation without the need for any electronic circuitry. This unique property has been deployed to demonstrate a prototype self-sustained sensor for air-borne particle monitoring.I have managed to overcome one of the obstacles for MEMS resonators, which is their relatively poor temperature stability. This is a major drawback when compared with the conventional quartz crystals. A significant decrease of the large negative TCF for the resonators has been attained by doping the devices with a high concentration of phosphorous, resulting in even slightly positive TCF for some of the devices. This is also expected to improve the phase noise characteristics of oscillators implemented utilizing such frequency references by eliminating the sharp dependence to electronic noise in the resonator bias current.Finally it is well known that non-uniformities in fabrication of MEMS resonators lead to variations in their frequency. I have proposed both active (non-permanent) and permanent frequency modification to compensate for variations in frequency of the MEMS resonators.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Preschool children&apos;s perceptions around gender identity and development can be influenced by their experiences.  With many children spending a portion of their day in child care, the environmental factors of these programs are important.  One aspect of the environment can impact preschool children is the books that are available to them.  For over 40 years, children&apos;s literature in the United States has been studied and found to be biased in their portrayal of males and females.  Males were more often found as main characters and depicted as capable leaders and thinkers.  Female characters were shown as weaker, often appearing in home settings and in traditional work roles.This study was conducted in Denver, Colorado and Oslo, Norway to compare the preschool literature between the two countries, since Norway has consistently ranked as one of the most gender equal countries in the world.  The question was whether the greater equality in Norwegian society would be reflected in the books that are read to its young children.The results of the study indicate that while both countries continue to need improvement on the proportion of male and female main characters, Norway had nearly three times the number of books that depict a male and female main character sharing the role of main character.  This could indicate a pattern of shared responsibilities between the sexes in Norwegian culture, as compared to the more patriarchal American society.   The United States had significantly more instances of fact books, such as letter and number recognition.The investigation of traditional role depiction of male and female characters showed additional significant differences between the two countries.  The United States literature depicted females in traditional roles more often and included lower instances of characters in non-traditional roles.  Norwegian books were most likely to depict characters in gender neutral roles.It does appear that the cultural norms of gender equity in Norway are reflected in the literature that is available to the children in their preschool programs and that American teachers may be able to learn how to more closely examine their own classroom libraries for bias.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Homework is a defining component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), however, few studies have examined homework adherence in youth CBT. Homework adherence was coded from audiotapes of school-based CBT for 50 depressed adolescents and evaluated as a predictor of proximal and distal treatment outcomes. Six therapist behaviors hypothesized to promote homework adherence were also coded from audiotapes of early sessions and examined in relation to subsequent homework adherence. Results showed no significant associations between client homework adherence and outcomes. Results also revealed several therapist behaviors to be associated with homework adherence in the context of planned moderator analyses. Adolescents considered at risk for non-adherence tended to show better adherence when therapists provided strong rationale for homework tasks, spent more time assigning homework in Session 1, and elicited client reactions and troubleshot obstacles in Session 2. Methodological and clinical implications are discussed.</dc:description>
