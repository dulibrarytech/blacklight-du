  <dc:description>Autism is a debilitating disorder (Yurov et al., 2007) that is diagnosed in 1 in 88 children in America (CDC, 2012). The autism population overwhelmingly performs weakest in reading comprehension as compared to other academic areas (Chiang &amp; Lin, 2007; Minshew, 1994). This identified weaknesses is concerning because comprehension is understood in the literature as the most critical curricular area (Chiang &amp; Lin, 2007). One potential reason for these comprehension problems could be impaired imagery. &lt;/DISS_para&gt;

&lt;DISS_para&gt;Neuropsychology research has found that children with autism cognitively process imagery differently than typical children, due to their unique brain structures (Just, Cherkassky, Keller, &amp; Minshew, 2004). This study sought to uncover whether or not children with autism show weaker abilities on imagery-related comprehension tasks than typical children. However, no instrument exists that is validated for this purpose.&lt;/DISS_para&gt;

&lt;DISS_para&gt;Archived diagnostic data were examined to develop a scale to assess imagery-related comprehension skills. Data were analyzed from 71 children (N=71), with and without autism, aged 5-13. A four phase approach from Benson &amp; Clark (1982) was used to develop the instrument. A multiple regression analytic method was used to see whether or not diagnosis was a significant predictor of scores on the imagery scale. Results were that children with autism scored significantly lower than typically developing children, controlling for the effects of IQ, age, and gender. Implications for practice are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation uses the connections between loops and their associated permutation groups to study certain varieties of loops. We first define a variety of loops generalizing commutative automorphic loops and show this new variety is power associative. We show a correspondence to Bruck loops of odd order and use this correspondence to give structural results for our new variety, which in turn hold for commutative automorphic loops. Next, we study a variety of loops that generalize both Moufang and Steiner loops. We extend on known results for Moufang loops and then extend two different doubling constructions for creating Moufang and other varieties of loops. We then give a general construction to create simple RCC loops from $GL(2,q)$ for $q$ a prime power. Finally, we consider a generalization of Bruck loops, and show that different companions of pseudoautomorphism live in certain subloops.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In 2013, many public education reform efforts in the United States of America center on testing and accountability. Recent data revealed that teachers have the single greatest in-school impact on student learning; however, the methods to assess teacher effectiveness are widely criticized for not holding teachers accountable and, consequently, are experiencing significant legislative attention. In 2010, Colorado passed Senate Bill 10-191: The Great Teachers and Leaders Act to improve student learning by revising teacher and principal evaluations, including linking them to student learning data, and eradicating tenure. Teachers, administrators, and policymakers hold critical roles in the implementation of this bill, yet little is known about how members of each group perceive their respective roles in the implementation. This explanatory sequential mixed methods study was designed to gather perception data from these three groups, through surveys and interviews. Data revealed that teachers and administrators do not have similar perceptions of many matters related to teacher evaluations, education reform, and the implementation of Senate Bill 10-191 (SB 191). The data also revealed that teachers and administrators expected they would agree on these matters. These collective findings led to multiple recommendations, such as the need for increased dialogue between teachers and administrators about their own perceptions of education reforms.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Even 150 years after Charles Darwin published &lt;italic&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/italic&gt;, public school teachers still find themselves dealing with student resistance to learning about biological evolution. Some teachers deal with this pressure by undermining, de-emphasizing, or even omitting the topic in their science curriculum. Others face the challenge and deliver solid scientific instruction of evolutionary theory despite the conflicts that may arise. The latter were the topic of this study.  I interviewed five teachers that had experience dealing with resistance to learning evolution in their school community. Through these in-depth interviews, I examined strategies these teachers use when facing resistance and how they help students deal with the cognitive dissonance that may be experienced when learning about evolution. I selected the qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship to organize and categorize my data.  From the interviews, the following findings emerged. Experienced teachers increased their confidence in teaching evolution by pursuing outside professional development. They not only learned more about evolutionary theory, but about creationist arguments against evolution. These teachers front-load their curriculum to integrate the nature of science into their lessons to address misunderstandings about how science works. They also highlight the importance of learning evolutionary theory but ensure students they do not have an agenda to indoctrinate students. Finally these experienced teachers work hard to create an intellectually safe learning environment to build trusting and respectful relationships with their students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Among the reasons behind construction of the light rail system in the 1990s and 2000s and currently the FasTracks lines, in Denver metro region, has been reduction of traffic congestion and consolidation of land use. This research analyzes the success of the rail transit system in achieving the above-mentioned goals. 
A temporal and spatial analysis of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data from 1992 to 2008 on the highways in Denver has been conducted to determine if traffic congestion has reduced after the initial light rail service began in 1994. Temporal analysis provides an insight into the changes in the level of highway traffic before and after the opening of three segments (Central, Southwest, and Southeast Corridors) of the light rail system. This part of the analysis also compares the traffic levels of highways affected by light rail with those not affected by light rail. Spatial analysis examines whether the changes have taken place uniformly throughout all the highways, or whether they have been concentrated on particular highways. Results indicate that light rail has reduced level of traffic along some of the adjacent highways for a short period of time. Overall, the three light rail corridors in operation have succeeded in lowering the rate of increase in the level of traffic on highways near the rail transit as compared to highways not near the rail transit. Change in the amount of different types of land use namely commercial, mixed, industrial, multi-family residential, and single-family residential has been examined from 1990 to 2010 for Denver and surrounding counties to determine whether greater developments have taken place within the rail transit corridors than outside. The change has been analyzed in terms of total square footage of the building areas as well as land use density. Besides descriptive statistics, inferential statistics have been used for Denver County only, to determine if the changes are significantly different within and outside the rail transit corridors. The growth of commercial land use has been higher within the rail transit corridors in all the counties. The growth has been statistically significant for Denver County. Single-family residential land use has noticeable increased outside the rail transit corridors in all the counties. However, the growth has not been statistically significant throughout the study time period in Denver County. The other types of land use have not shown any consistent pattern in their growth. Overall, the present and proposed rail transit lines in Denver metro region have been very successful in consolidating commercial land use around them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Teacher burn out contributes to the epidemic of early career exit. At least half of all new K-12 teachers leave the profession by the time they reach their fifth year of teaching. Conversely, there are urban teachers who survive burn out and thrive as career- long educators. This qualitative study is an in-depth look into one 40-year veteran teacher&apos;s career narrative, answering the question: How did this teacher not only survive but also thrive as a career-long urban teacher? Additionally, the following sub-questions are explored: a) How is her spirit sustained throughout her teacher life cycle? b) How can her story contribute to the literature as a counter-narrative to the current rhetoric focused on &quot;teacher bashing&quot;? A critical socio-political lens guides this study. The socio-political forces that lead to urban teacher burn out are explained. The idea of teacher burn in, in which educators experience the symptoms of burn out, but choose to remain in the profession and exist as toxic influences, is discussed and related to teacher career theory. However, the more hopeful idea of urban teacher thrival is uncovered through narrative methodology. This narrative study reveals three salient themes. First hope springs eternal is the idea that sustaining hope supported the veteran teacher&apos;s career thrival. Next, the extended education family is the notion that familial-like relationships at school nourished the teacher&apos;s longevity. The third theme, creative autonomy, reveals that by being empowered with opportunities for curriculum development and instructional decision-making the teacher maintained her passion. Each theme was influenced by the participant&apos;s internal dispositional factors and external conditional factors. These factors are discussed. The above themes, combined with deeply rooted caring relationships with students, proved to be the most important aspects of the participant&apos;s sustained spirit. Furthermore, this study illustrates how teacher narratives can act as counter-narratives to teacher bashing through revealing the systemic impact that can be made by the career of one thriving teacher. Implications for teachers, educational leaders, teacher educators and researchers are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Psychotherapy research reveals consistent associations between therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes in the youth and adult literature. Despite these consistent findings, prospective associations are not sufficient to support the claim that the alliance is a change mechanism in psychotherapy. The current study examined the direction of effect of the alliance- outcome relationship, the contribution of early symptom change in treatment to the development of therapeutic alliance, and the potential for pretreatment interpersonal functioning characteristics to be third variables that account for the association between alliance and outcome. Participants were adolescents with depression and a history of interpersonal trauma that presented to a community mental health center for treatment. Findings demonstrated that a more positive therapeutic alliance predicted greater subsequent symptom improvement, even after removing symptom change occurring before the measurement of alliance. Results also suggested that early change only slightly contributed to alliance development. Finally, though pretreatment interpersonal functioning was related to the first session alliance, these pretreatment client characteristics were not related to later alliance or symptom change. Overall, results provided some support for therapeutic alliance as a mechanism of change in psychotherapy. Methodological and clinical issues are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Techno-economic and systems studies on microalgal growth scenarios to date are abbreviated and missing a number of important variables. By including these variables in a detailed model integrating biology, chemistry, engineering, and financial aspects, a more defined systems analysis is possible. Through optimizing the model productivity based on the resulting net profit, the system analysis results in a more accurate assessment of environmental and economic sustainability of specific algal growth scenarios. Photobioreactor algal growth scenario optimization in the system model has resulted in realistic engineering design requirements based on algal growth requirements and fluid dynamics analysis. Results show feasibility for photobioreactor growth scenarios to be economically sustainable when co-products are included, but definite technological advancements and productivity improvements must be made. The main factors inhibiting a cost effective photobioreactor growth scenario are culture density, temperature, and lighting distribution for solar illuminated photobioreactors, and lighting cost for artificially illuminated photobioreactors. Open pond algal growth scenarios do not show any prospect of economic or environmental sustainability with current technology due to the large amount of surface area required, inefficient water use, and low culture density. All algal growth scenarios are inferior to petro-diesel regarding energy inputs, carbon emissions, and environmental sustainability. No algal growth scenarios analyzed in this study meet the U.S. requirement of biofuel emitting at least 20% less carbon emissions than diesel from crude oil.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Algebra is typically the gatekeeper for higher-level math coursework. Low math performance on standardized assessments impedes access to these higher-level math classes. Limited math progress in high school affects future career opportunities and quality of life. High school students who have historically struggled with math need interventions that work. Research indicates that the research on reading interventions far outnumbers the research on math interventions. With the passage of new federal legislation requiring schools to document progress for all groups of students and allowing schools to use Response to Intervention models, the need for evidence based math interventions becomes even more pressing. This research examined the effects of the MIND Research Institute&apos;s Algebra Readiness program in order to provide an evidence base for this intervention. In this pre- experimental study, two groups of high school students were exposed to the MIND Research Institute&apos;s Algebra Readiness program and changes in their math performance were analyzed. Students with and without diagnosed disabilities, were assigned to two tiers of intervention. The double dosed students received instruction with the core Algebra I curriculum and the Algebra Readiness program whereas the single dosed students only received the Algebra Readiness intervention. Independent samples t-tests; ANCOVA, percentage change, qualitative teacher responses and correlation procedures were used to analyze the scores of students. The outcome measures included scores on a post test, grade level curriculum based measures and the state sponsored standardized assessment. Because of limited sample size and possible lack of sensitivity of the outcome measures, overall no significant growth was detected. The students who were double dosed showed significant growth on the end of year, grade level assessment as compared to those students who only participated in the intervention. Although the sample size was small, the effect sizes were large, indicating potential practical significance for this intervention. This research suggests that using visual spatial representations in a mostly nonverbal, computer-based format may show promise as an intervention for students. More research with a larger sample size and a more controlled research design will help definitively answer the questions about the effectiveness of the Algebra Readiness program</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Harmonics are always present in electrical power systems. Harmonic distortion is harmless as long as its level is within the limit. However, with the recent rapid advancement of power electronics, i.e. non linear loads, the use of the variable speed drives are increasing day by day. Harmonics produced by non-linear loads are a potential risk if they are not evaluated, predicted, and controlled. The power electronic switching devices like thyristor used in the rectifier circuits inject harmonic distortion to the utility grid in different applications. The harmonic distortion causes different problems in the power system. To minimize the unwanted effects of harmonic distortion, IEEE Std 519-1992 recommends the amount of harmonics that is acceptable in the power system. IEEE Std 519-1992 suggests that an individual harmonic distortion to be under 3% and the total harmonic distortion, THD, to be under 5% of the fundamental component. Harmonic distortion can be mitigated using different methods. Based on the system configuration either active filters, passive filters, or phase shifting methods are used. In medium voltage high power applications, generally, phase shifting method is better suited. In addition to harmonic distortion in AC side, AC-DC converter produce ripple in DC side. DC ripple can be mitigated by the use of filter circuits. However, when phase shifting method is used in AC side for harmonic mitigation, a method called pulse multiplication can be used in DC side to mitigate DC ripple. Phase shifting and pulse multiplication methods are investigated in detail in this research. A three-phase 6-pulse rectifier is modeled in Alternative Transients Program (ATP). Voltage and Current waveforms are obtained and the amount of harmonic distortion produced is calculated. It was found that the harmonic distortion produced by an ideal three-phase 6-pulse rectifier to be 31.1% and not under IEEE 519-1992 recommendation. Therefore a 12-pulse rectifier has been investigated. The analysis shows that a 12-pulse rectifier produces 15.3% THD and provides a window opportunity to be used in certain areas where the grid is comparatively stronger. For a rectifier to be able to be used without ac side filter and dc side filter, and to mitigate the THD under the IEEE std 519-1992 recommendation and the dc ripple under the specified value, a higher pulse rectifier will be needed. Further investigation is needed using 18-pulse and 24-pulse phase shifting rectifiers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation presents a design to examine the effects of environmental factors in a country such as education systems levels, corruption, and social freedoms on investment outcomes. The literature review suggests that countries with poor education at the secondary level tend to have lower standards of living, lower levels of freedom, as well as high levels of corruption which appear to have negative effects on their market economies. This study was designed to examine existing data from multiple sources along multiple dimensions, and use a hierarchical linear model, as well as a portfolio optimization model, to assess the impact of these factors. This was accomplished by posing research questions, and collecting and analyzing data from Standard and Poors, Transparency International, and the World Values Organization, as well as the Programe for International Student Assessment. The outcomes of this study generally support the thesis that country-level factors do, in fact, have a bearing on investment outcomes, and that further research in this area is warranted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This exploratory case study examined the perspectives of state-level elected officials regarding what influences policy decisions related to child abuse and neglect issues. By interviewing six former state-level elected officials, the study explored what policy makers believe about their ability to impact child abuse policies, how they define, and ways they have experienced. evidence-based policy, and what they know about risk factors and protective factors with regard to child abuse-related policy. The study design was inspired by the Harvard Family Research Project&apos;s (2005) Bellwether Methodology, which bases advocacy strategy on the knowledge base and input from influential policy makers. The findings from this study are intended to provide insights about how advocates, researchers, and other stakeholders can most effectively influence child abuse-related policy decisions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A novel architecture is presented for reducing communication delay variability for a group of robots. This architecture relies on using three components: a microprocessor architecture that allows deterministic real-time tasks; an event-based communication protocol in which nodes transmit in a TDMA fashion, without the need of global clock synchronization techniques; and a novel communication scheme that enables deterministic communications by allowing senders to transmit without regard for the state of the medium or coordination with other senders, and receivers can tease apart messages sent simultaneously with a high probability of success. This approach compared to others, allows simultaneous communications without regard for the state of the transmission medium, it allows deterministic communications, and it enables ordered communications that can be a applied in a team of robots. Simulations and experimental results are also included.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Poverty has been linked to reduced workforce opportunities, reduced college-going rates, increased social-emotional challenges, and even negative health consequences. Postsecondary educational opportunities, offered during high school, that contribute to the acquisition of social capital may improve academic outcomes for students from impoverished backgrounds. The Colorado concurrent enrollment legislation, provides one opportunity for students to enroll in college level coursework and receive college credits with tuition being paid through state funding while in high school. Concurrent enrollment (CE) programs support the college application, financial aid and enrollment processes. Most importantly, they also support the development of social networks that may foster beneficial secondary and postsecondary outcomes. This dissertation examines the participation and representation rates of free and reduced lunch (FRL) students in CE programs at the state and local level. Next, the impact of CE participation on secondary and postsecondary outcomes in students from impoverished backgrounds is examined. The quasi-experimental research design included a matched control group generated by logistic regression and propensity score matching techniques. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate unaccounted for variance that may have contributed to any observed between-group differences. Between-group differences were examined for a range of outcomes at the high school and postsecondary level. The study analysis was replicated utilizing two additional groups of program participants across two years to increase confidence in the obtained findings. Overall, the findings indicate that FRL students were underrepresented as concurrent enrollment participants during the 2010 and 2011 academic years. A limited number of local education agencies had FRL student participation rates that exceeded enrollment expectations. Statistical analysis indicated that FRL students earned CE credits at a lower rate than their non-eligible peers. In contrast, the FRL students enrolled for a larger number of CE credits than non-eligible students. Additional analysis revealed that a number of positive secondary and post-secondary outcomes were related to concurrent enrollment participation for economically disadvantaged students. The results of sensitivity analyses indicate that other, unaccounted for variables were unlikely to have impacted the obtained findings. The findings of this study indicate that concurrent enrollment opportunities may mitigate some of the deleterious impacts of poverty by improving academic achievement and college-going rates. The beneficial role of social capital for achievement of post-secondary success is discussed</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this dissertation, we discussed the shape, energy level and density of defects in Organic Photovoltaic devices(OPV) by both theoretical and experimental methods. Energy band structure and intrinsic junctions of general standard and inverted OPV devices are investigated in detail. Transportation of separated holes and electrons in both structure are well analyzed. In chapter II, we developed a Monte-Carlo model to simulate charge transport process in organic materials. Marcus theory is applied to calculate the carrier transfer rate to build up hopping process in ideal lattices. Results of this model showed several properties of carriers regarding mobility, reorganization energy and Poole-Frenkel behavior. Time-of-Flight(TOF) measurement is simulated by our Monte-Carlo model. Typical four phases of TOF are fitted in simulation exactly as in experiment data. In chapter III, we introduced Impedance Spectroscopy as a useful technique to examine overall electronic component and internal structure. Geometric capacitance and depletion region are found to describe the equivalent circuit of OPV. Another part of this chapter showed that impedance data can be also used by Mott-Schottky analysis to calculate the doping density and built-in voltage of schottky junction, which is widely considered existing in standard OPV devices. Degradation and Life time study are the major topics of chapter IV. We compared three devices within different thickness of active layers under different illumination intensity. Open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor are deeply analyzed to explain the decrease of conversion efficiency during degradation process. In addition, we present simple method to estimate the lifetime of free carriers. In chapter V, impedance spectroscopy is used to investigate the electronic structure of OPV devices, with the goal of understanding the role of defect states. Capacitance-voltage measurements in the temperature range of 77 - 300 K are carried out to determine the activation energy of trap states. Preliminary results show at least one type of defect state residing at 165.6 meV in standard blends of P3HT:PCBM. Furthermore we compared three different molecular weight of P3HT in both standard and inverted devices. Result shows that higher molecular weight provides deeper defects energy level, and density of defects generated during fabrication is different for standard and inverted structures. In chapter VI, JV curve behavior, Capacitor-Voltage analysis and efficiency comparison before annealing and after annealing are showed to conclude that P-N junction is formed at ZnO/P3HT interface in inverted device. We also discussed the free carrier transportation in both structure and explain why annealing leads to different conversion efficiency change. Finally the equivalent circuit is confirmed by geometric capacitance coincidence as well as structure and transportation analysis in whole dissertation</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study explores relationships among several established correlates of trauma in women exposed to intimate partner abuse (IPA), including PTSD, depression, and dissociation symptoms as well as alcohol use as well as other trauma-related variables, such as social support and violence exposure. Two analysis methods were utilized: variable-oriented methods, which examine relationships between variables, and person-oriented analysis methods, which examine groupings of participants within a larger sample (N = 233). Results of the variable-oriented analyses indicated positive links among depression, PTSD, dissociation, and alcohol use in women exposed to IPA, as well as positive links between the aforementioned psychological symptoms and exposure to violence. Social support was related to decreased psychological symptoms. Person-oriented analyses indicated the presence of four unique profiles of women within the larger study sample: Profile 1, which was labeled High Dissociation, Low Depression/PTSD; Profile 2, which was labeled Low Symptoms, High Social Support, Profile 3,  which was labeled Low Dissociation, High Depression/PTSD; and Profile 4, which was labeled High Symptoms, Low Social Support. This research supports previous findings about the relationships among several variables related to IPA as well as suggests the need for careful consideration of differences among women within the larger context of research, advocacy, and clinical interventions related to IPA.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>First, this research presents experimental and theoretical investigation of the response of micro scale dual-plate thermal-piezoresistive resonators (TPR) and self-sustained oscillators (TPO) to different gases and pressures. It is demonstrated that the resonant frequency of such devices follows particular trends in response to the changes in the surrounding gas and its pressure. A mathematical model has been derived to explain the damping dependent frequency shift characteristic of TPO. The solution of the model indicates that the stiffness of the actuator beam decreases as the value of damping coefficient drops at lower gas density caused by the change in the gas molecular mass or pressure. When operated in the TPR mode of the same device, however, the frequency shift of the same silicon structure is mainly a function of gas thermal conductivity. The two different sensing mechanisms are confirmed by the measurement results showing opposite frequency shift for the TPR and TPO in helium-nitrogen mixtures. In pressure tests, frequency shifts as high as -2300ppm were measured for a TPO by changing the air pressure from 84kPa to 43kPa. Second, the effect of geometry on thermoelastic damping (TED) in micro beam resonators is evaluated using an eigenvalue finite element formulation and its corresponding customized MATLAB program. The vented clamped-clamped (CC) and clamped-free (CF) beams with square-shaped vents along their center lines, are both analyzed. The quality factor and resonant frequency are obtained as functions of various geometrical parameters including the location, number and size of the vents. The numerical results reveal that the addition of vent sections in the clamped end region can significantly enhance the quality factor under TED. The maximum improved quality factor as high as 3,801 and 2,257 times as those of the solid CC and CF beams are realized. The methodology presented in this work provides a useful tool in the design optimization of micro beam resonators against TED. Third, a new method to compensate the TED by taking the advantage of piezoresistive effect is proposed. Such method is implemented by applying an electrostatic field through the MEMS beam resonator with negative piezoresistive coefficient. In the case of vibration, the stretched part of the beam generates higher electrical power thus higher temperature and vice versa. Such temperature distribution can compensate the opposite thermoelastic temperature to suppress TED. The work principle is described by a set of coupled differential equations and then solved by an eigenvalue finite element method. The numerical result indicates that the TED in beam resonators can be completely suppressed when the strength of electrical field reaches a critical value, namely CEF. The value of the CEF is further analyzed by parametric studies on various material properties and geometric factors</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using the discourse of Political Theology as a mode of inquiry we can overcome a longstanding tension between aesthetics and history that characterized much of twentieth century thought. Focusing on literary and occasionally musical works from the mid twentieth century, my aim is to show how works displaying psychedelic aesthetics are important venues for political deliberation with regard to citizenship. Through affective means, psychedelic aesthetics re-imagine the boundaries of liberal subjectivity through a consciousness expansion and return from that expansion. The subject who returns from a psychedelic &quot;experience&quot; - which can be attained in various ways - comes to ethically realign and re-norm his or her &quot;self&quot; according to a moral authority beyond the authority of the nation state. While critical of liberalism on one level, this &quot;expanded&quot; citizenship ultimately offers liberalism political advice in crisis situations by performing a public sacrifice on the state and disseminating social responsibility to individuals. Psychedelic aesthetics perform this `public sacrifice&apos; through affective enchantment, using spiritual and religious rhetoric to change the relationship between citizen and state. Because artistic works of the mid twentieth century are essentially &quot;ahead of the game&quot; regarding states of exception and economic crises, it is to this period that we should look for methods of cultural recovery in current ones. But this requires that we take both aesthetic and religious enchantment seriously in a post-secular world</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation dwells on the intersections of language-use and perception. The premise is that language makes literal sense and this reality has profound implications for those Burke called &quot;symbol-using/mis-using animals.&quot; Communication scholars have long accepted a model of communication that positions language as &quot;constitutive articulate contact&quot; as opposed to a discrete means of transmission (Stewart, 1994), but a great deal of work remains to be done in terms of developing the implications for individuals and their language-use. Chapter One explores the stances embraced by rhetorical materialists struggling to describe how language matters. The first chapter fields a series of critiques that essentially argue that a &quot;grounding logic&quot; is needed to organize our understanding of the processes of linguistic sense making. Embodied-embedded cognition serves as that &quot;guiding logic.&quot; Chapter Two explores Embodied-embedded cognition, a counter-perspective to cognitivism - the approach that positions sense-making in a dualistic environment where the sense-able stuff of the &quot;real world&quot; and the sense-maker considering that world are different. Embodied-embedded cognition suggests an &quot;enactive&quot; view of worlding that recruits that attitudes and actions of the sense-maker in determining what ultimately becomes real. Chapter Three ties these two conversations together through the use of metaphor, arguing that metaphors make sense. Metaphors can be looked at metaphorically, as a form of &quot;grasping&quot; at the world that is remarkably creative as well as abundant. This perspective on metaphors vindicates the stances of embodied embedded thinkers and rhetorical materialists alike that argue that language matters. 
Chapters Four and Five speculate on some implications for public speaking pedagogy and ethics. Teaching language as a form of &quot;grasping&quot; changes fundamentally the kind of practice that is necessary to improve. Likewise, noting that the language that we employ has a literal effect on perception transforms the ethical implications of our speaking. Chapter Five concludes by suggesting a logic of non-violence as a practical and productive response to the ethical demands placed on symbol-users.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick&apos;s disease, and corticobasal degeneration, the deposition of fibrils composed of misfolded tau protein is observed. Recent evidence suggests that tau fibrils transfer between cells and spread throughout the brain, underscoring the significance of fibril propagation. Six tau isoforms exist in the adult human brain that can be grouped into 4-repeat (4R) tau and 3-repeat (3R) tau based on the presence or absence of the second of four microtubule binding repeats. We demonstrate in vitro that seeded fibril growth, a prerequisite for the spreading of the tau pathology, is crucially dependent on the isoform composition of individual seeds. Seeds of 3R tau and 3R/4R tau recruit both types of isoforms. Seeds of 4R tau recruit 4R tau, but not 3R tau, establishing an asymmetric barrier. Conformational templating of 4R tau onto 3R tau seeds eliminates this barrier, giving rise to a new type of tau fibril. Tau fibrils formed in vitro routinely utilize polyanionic molecules as cofactors to stimulate nucleation. A broad set of negatively charged cofactors, including nucleic acids, polypeptides, and glycosaminoglycans were applied to induce fibril assembly. Utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we found that the core structure of the fibril is conserved, regardless of cofactor used. Additionally, we assessed whether a cofactor provides a role in tau aggregation beyond inducing the initial nucleation events, and observed that the presence of a cofactor is needed for fibril propagation to be sustained. The cofactor-fibril interaction was investigated, revealing that cofactors are bound to the fibril and that the basis of the interaction is electrostatic. Cofactor binding is dynamic, as introduction of an alternative cofactor was shown to result in exchange with the bound cofactor. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a tool used for the detection of dilute concentrations of prion fibrils. We have successfully applied this concept towards the amplification of tau fibrils for the first time and demonstrated that fibrils can be amplified, even when diluted by several orders of magnitude. These findings provide basic mechanistic insights into the seeding, propagation, and diversification of tau fibrils. Importantly, we demonstrate that cofactors are not only of consequence for inducing nucleation events, but decorate the fibril and provide a critical role in fibril propagation</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study investigates the formative experiences that nurture ecological habits of mind in youth. The study builds on the ecological habits of mind defined by Moroye and Ingman: caring, a sense of interconnectedness, and ecological integrity. A combination of methods was used in this study: in-depth phenomenologically based interviewing, and educational criticism and connoisseurship. Data collection included two interviews each with five teenagers, one interview each with the teens&apos; mothers, photographing of artifacts, and a focus group with six additional teenagers. Observations and interpretations were filtered through ecological and aesthetic lenses. 
Several key findings emerged. First, it is proposed that three qualities of ecological mindedness be added to those already defined: imagination, active engagement, and self-efficacy. Second, a review of the data revealed that the values of ecologically minded teens include relationship, commitment, and growth. Third, formative influences on the teenagers included experiences in nature (including place, play, and aesthetic experiences), experiences with animals, adult mentorship, community, peer and sibling influence, religion, and story. The aesthetic dimensions of learning (connections, risk-taking, imagination, sensory experiences, perceptivity, and active engagement) were all found to be present in the experiences of the teens; it is proposed that crafting nature-oriented learning experiences with these dimensions in mind helps to nurture ecological mindedness. This study has implications for environmental and ecological education as well as education in general, including implications for teacher education. The values and experiences of the teens help inform the recommendations that educators provide opportunities for natural aesthetic experiences as well as ecological mentoring.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study presents a curriculum history of theological field education at Denver&apos;s Roman Catholic seminary, St. John Vianney. The study utilizes archival material and the historical method to construct an educational historiography of the evolution and development of theological field curricula from 1910-2010. The research questions focus on two areas: the role of the Catholic Church in shaping seminary curricula and the adaptation and application of these Church guidelines by practitioners in the local context. The study utilizes the conceptual tools of Kelly Ritter (2009) to analyze the findings in the light of socio-historical forces which shape curricula. According to Ritter&apos;s conceptualization, socio-historical processes have a greater impact on curricula than “theoretical research-based arguments” (p. 19). The role of the Church in providing prescriptive guidelines for curricula in Catholic seminaries and the application and adaption of these prescriptions in the local context“opens the possibility of generating new conceptual frameworks” and “adds an important dimension to curriculum history” (Kliebard, 1992, p. xiii).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines African-American Islamic culture from 1920 through 1959, a period I label the &quot;African-American Islamic Renaissance&quot; (AAIR). The AAIR is characterized by a significant increase in interest in Islam, extreme diversity in views about Islam, and the absence of a single organization dominating African-American Islamic culture for a significant amount of time. Previous works dealing with African-American Islam in this period have failed to fully recognize these features, particularly the last of these. As a result, explanations for the rise of the Nation of Islam (NOI) have not satisfactorily explained why it was only the NOI--and not other Islamic groups that were more popular than the NOI up until the mid-1950s--that became a &quot;mass movement,&quot; gaining the allegiance of tens of thousands of African Americans. There has been some tendency, for instance, to assume that the NOI was the most popular African-American Islamic group by the early 1950s, a notion that is probably an inference drawn from two other popular but inaccurate assumptions: that the NOI&apos;s rise was due primarily to its radical racialized doctrines and its charismatic leaders, particularly Malcolm X, who became a popular minister for the group in the early 1950s. I argue, however, that the NOI was in fact not the most popular African-American Islamic group until at least 1955, and even as late as 1959 its official membership numbers were not particularly large by AAIR standards. Also, its doctrines were not especially unique in the AAIR, nor was its having extremely charismatic leaders. I contend that the success of the NOI in the mid-to-late 1950s was the result of three levels of changes at the time: internal, external in the AAIR community, and external in the broader U.S, culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The physical structure of cellular membranes plays a critical role in lipid and protein sorting. A novel biosensor was developed to probe the influence of curvature on sorting. This biosensor mimics large, two-dimensional membranes in dynamic equilibrium, achieves high spatial resolution between curvature and molecules of interest, and has high sensitivity, enough for single particle detection. The biosensor consists of continuous supported lipid bilayer formed over nanoparticles (40 to 200 nm diameter) deposited on a glass substrate. The nanoparticles determine the extent of curvature. This biosensor is the first to observe large-scale 2-dimensional diffusion of biomolecules on a supported lipid bilayer with small radii of curvature in equilibrium with flat areas of fluid bilayer. This will allow correlation between protein function and the physical shape of a membrane. Fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify spatial sorting of lipids and a protein relevant to cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein (CRP). Two lipids, fluorescein labeled hexadecanoic acid and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, sense curvature by accumulating in areas over nanoparticles, and both are able to laterally exchange with surrounding lipids. Dynamic fluidity of the bilayer was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Lipids directly at sites of curvature recover more slowly than lipids over flat sections. The spatial distribution of CRP was also assessed. Curvature sensing of CRP is isoform dependent where native CRP does not sense curvature and modified CRP does sense curvature. Finally, we show that a ribonucleic acid aptamer will bind specifically to modified CRP and not native CRP, enabling isoform specific studies of CRP to be conducted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Wind is one of the most popular renewable energy sources and it has the potential to become the biggest energy source in future. Since the wind does not always blow constantly, the output wind power is not constant which may make some problem for the power grid. According to the grid code which is set by independent system operator, ISO, wind turbine generator systems need to follow some standards such as the predetermined acceptable power fluctuations. In order to smooth the output powers, the energy storage system and some power electronics modules are employed. The utilized power electronics modules in the wind turbine system can pursue many different goals, such as maintaining the voltage stability, frequency stability, providing the available and predetermined output active and reactive power. On the other side, the energy storage system can help achieving some of these goals but its main job is to store the extra energy when not needed and release the stored energy when needed. The energy storage system can be designed in different sizes, material and also combination of different energy storage systems (hybrid designs). Combination of power electronics devises and also energy storage system helps the wind turbine systems to smooth the output power according to the provided standards. In addition prediction of wind speed may improve the performance of wind turbine generator systems. In this research study all these three topics are studied and the obtained results are written in 10 papers which 7 of them are published and three of them are under process.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The maintenance of network connectivity is essential for effective and efficient mobile team operations. Achieving robust mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) connectivity requires a capable link maintenance mechanism especially if the network experiences expected intermittent connectivity due to a hostile environment. One applicable example of such network scenarios is multi-robot exploration for urban search and rescue (USAR). With the proliferation of these robotic networks, communication problems such as the link maintenance problem are subject to be raised quickly. Although various routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks have been proposed, they solve the problems of message routing and link maintenance separately, resulting in additional overhead costs and long latency in network communication. Traditional routing protocols discover existing links, connect these links, find the best path and minimize the path cost. The limitation of previous routing protocols motivates us to develop a new concept of routing mechanism for a robotic network. This routing mechanism is named Meta-Routing. Meta-Routing expands current routing protocols to include not only the normal routing of packets, but also the maintenance of links in mobile agent scenarios. Thus, Meta-Routing minimizes the communication path cost and the overhead cost, the latter of which results from discovering a route, repairing a link or establishing a new communication path between nodes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With the advent of globalization and technological development, English has become a necessary tool of international communication in many areas such as education, business, politics, commerce, science, and technology throughout the world. Also, English has become the most widely taught foreign language in the world (Kachru &amp;Nelson, 1996). Moreover, the issue of successful implementation of the English language curriculum has been the focus of a number of studies. In the case of Libya, however, little research has been conducted on teachers&apos; perceptions of the new English language curriculum in Libyan high schools. Thus, teachers&apos; voices have not been examined or heard regarding this issue in the TEFL field. This study was conducted in a region of Libya called Tarhuna, southeast of the capital Tripoli, where there has been no study with the scale and scope of this research.  The study showed that there were differences between the degrees of CLT principles practice. The percentage of CLT principles practice was 75.4%, with an average mean score of 3.77. Results also showed a number of factors that are considered as major concerns by the participants. These factors included teacher&apos;s limited time for teaching CLT materials, insufficient funding, students&apos; low English proficiency, teachers&apos; lack of training in CLT, few opportunities for in-service training in CLT, large classes, lack of support from colleagues and administrators, a focus on rote memorization in teaching and learning, students&apos; resistance to a learner-centered classroom, students&apos; lack of motivation for developing communicative competence, and students&apos; resistance to class participation. The mismatch between the realities of the classroom, student resistance, and the principles and goals of the new curriculum created a significant challenge for teachers. The data indicate that there is a gap between what is expected in the new curriculum and what is actually being done in classrooms. 
Therefore, I believe the findings of this study provide invaluable information that can be used for the revision and improvement of the English language curriculum in Libyan high schools. The study also sheds some light on the strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum, reveals some of the obstacles and barriers that teachers encounter in implementing the curriculum, and provides recommendations to overcome these barriers where they exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate the implementation process of the new English language curriculum in Libyan high schools by examining teachers&apos; perceptions of the curriculum and how it is taught and reflected in their classroom practices.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Representations of the Care of the Soul in Early Christian Texts</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Michel Foucault argues that modern scholars have inaccurately conceptualized ancient Greco-Roman philosophies as the pursuit of abstract knowledge. He proposes instead conceiving of these philosophies more broadly as sets of practices that focused on &amp;ldquo;the care of the self/soul.&amp;rdquo; Such care involved exercises (&amp;ldquo;technologies of the self&amp;rdquo;) effecting both identity formation and spiritual transformation. It is possible to re-conceptualize the history of the early Christianities in these terms as well, particularly in examining the discourses circulating in the second and third centuries of the Common Era. Juxtaposition and close reading of texts from this period reveal that competing visions of the care of the soul informed by Stoic ideals were circulating among Christians. Specifically, these conflicting perspectives revolved around, on one hand, a dominant, &amp;ldquo;proto-orthodox&amp;rdquo; discourse glorifying martyrdom and, on the other, disruptions to this discourse by those misleadingly subsumed under the umbrella term, &amp;ldquo;Gnostic.&amp;rdquo; Chapter one explores the value of applying Foucault&apos;s framework to the history of the early Christianities. Chapter two explains the way in which martyrdom functions as care of the soul, or therapy of the emotions, in texts ascribed to Clement, Ignatius, and Polycarp. Chapter three demonstrates the way other early Christian texts disrupt this discourse of a &amp;ldquo;suffering self&amp;rdquo; while simultaneously laying out other views of self-care. Specific texts for examination include two texts from Nag Hammadi--&lt;italic&gt;Apocalypse of Peter&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Testimony of Truth&lt;/italic&gt;, two fragments preserved by Clement of Alexandria--one attributed to Basilides and one to Valentinus, and the &lt;italic&gt;Gospel of Judas&lt;/italic&gt;. Chapter four discusses how Mary Magdalene and Perpetua are represented in terms of the care of the soul in, respectively, the &lt;italic&gt;Gospel of Mary&lt;/italic&gt; and the &lt;italic&gt;Passion of Perpetua and Felicity&lt;/italic&gt; and what is at stake for women&apos;s leadership roles in each of these portrayals. Viewing the early debates in this way--as conflicts regarding issues of self-identity and spiritual development--rather than as debates about knowledge per se (doctrines defined in essentialist terms) provides a means of moving beyond the simplistic characterization of the richly diverse groups in this period as either merely &amp;ldquo;proto-orthodox&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;heretical.&amp;rdquo;

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) The Hybrid Spirit Animating Chinese Pentecostals in Malaysia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation interrogates the assertion in postcolonial scholarship, especially from the work of Homi Bhabha that the construction and performance of hybrid identities act as a form of resistance for marginalized communities against structures of oppression. While this study supports this assertion, it also critiques how hybridity fails to address issues of unequal power relations. This has led to an uncritical use of hybridity that reproduces the very idea of static identity which its proponents claim to transcend. 
      Through qualitative study of Chinese members of a Pentecostal church in Malaysia, this study argues that church members engage in &quot;unequal belonging&quot; where they privilege certain elements of their identities over others. In concert with Pierre Bourdieu&apos;s conceptions of habitus, field, and capital, unequal belonging highlights how hybridity fails to capture the intersecting and competing loyalties, strategies, and complexities of identity formation on a contextual level. Unequal belonging challenges postcolonial scholars to locate the subtle workings of power and privilege that manifest even among marginalized communities. 
      The study first situates the Chinese through an analysis of the historical legacy of British colonialism that has structured the country&apos;s current socio-political configuration along bounded categories of identification. The habitus constrains church members to accept certain Chinese ethnic markers as &quot;givens.&quot; Although they face continuous marginalization, interviewee data demonstrates that church members negotiate their Chineseness and construct a &quot;Modern Chinese&quot; ethnic identity as a strategic move away from Chinese stereotypes. Moreover, conversion to Christianity affords church members access to cultural capital. Yet, it is limited and unequal capital. In particular, the &quot;Chinese Chinese,&quot; who church members have demarcated as backward and traditional, are unable to gain access to this capital because they lack fluency in English and knowledge in modern, westernized worldviews.
      Unequal belonging nuances monolithic conceptions of hybridity. It demonstrates how church members&apos; privilege of Christianity over Chineseness exposes the complex processes of power and privilege that makes westernized-English-speaking Chinese Christians culturally &quot;higher&quot; than non-English-speaking, non-Christian, Chinese. This study provides significant contribution to the complex aspect of hybridity where it is both a site of resistance and oppression.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) &quot;Our Father Isaac&quot;: Reading the Sahidic Testament of Isaac in an Egyptian Monastic Context</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation argues that the textual community of fourth or fifth century monastic Egypt read Testament of Isaac as an ascetical regimen in order to transform themselves into children of Isaac. T. Isaac highlights three particular dimensions of Isaac&apos;s character from the remembered tradition of Isaac that would have resonated in the Egyptian monastic context of the textual community - Isaac as priestly authority, Isaac as sacrifice, and Isaac as blind ascetic - to create a model for the new self that the textual community aimed to achieve. Two important ascetic practices in T. Isaac that the textual community was to perform were copying and reading T. Isaac. These two practices functioned as technologies of the self that helped the members of the textual community to transform their present subjectivity into a new self modeled on Isaac in T. Isaac.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Oxide Semiconductors For Organic Opto-electronic Devices</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Development of transparent oxide semiconductors (TOS)  from Earth-abundant materials is of great interest for cost-effective thin film device applications, such as solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), touch-sensitive displays, electronic paper, and transparent thin film transistors. The need of inexpensive or high performance electrode might be even greater for organic photovoltaic (OPV), with the goal to harvest renewable energy with inexpensive, lightweight, and cost competitive materials.  The natural abundance of zinc and the wide bandgap ($sim$3.3 eV) of its oxide make it an ideal candidate. 
      In this dissertation, I have introduced various concepts on the modulations of various surface, interface and bulk opto-electronic properties of ZnO based semiconductor for charge transport, charge selectivity and optimal device performance. I have categorized  transparent semiconductors  into two sub groups depending upon their role in a device. Electrodes, usually 200 to 500 nm thick, optimized for good transparency and transporting the charges to the external circuit. Here, the electrical conductivity in parallel direction to thin film, i.e bulk conductivity is important.  And contacts, usually 5 to 50 nm thick, are optimized in case of solar cells for providing charge selectivity and  asymmetry to manipulate the built in field inside the device for charge separation and collection. Whereas in Organic LEDs (OLEDs),  contacts provide optimum energy level alignment at organic oxide interface for improved charge injections. 
      For an optimal solar cell performance, transparent electrodes are designed with maximum transparency in the region of interest to maximize the light to pass through to the absorber layer for photo-generation, plus they are designed for minimum sheet resistance for efficient charge collection and transport. As such there is need for material with high conductivity and transparency. Doping ZnO with some common elements such as B, Al, Ga, In, Ge, Si, and F result in n-type doping with increase in carriers resulting in  high conductivity electrode, with better or comparable opto-electronic properties compared to current industry-standard indium tin oxide (ITO). Furthermore, improvement in mobility due to improvement on crystallographic structure also provide alternative path for high conductivity ZnO TCOs. 
      Implementing these two aspects, various studies were done on gallium doped zinc oxide (GZO) transparent electrode, a very promising indium free electrode. The dynamics of the superimposed RF and DC power sputtering was utilized to improve the microstructure during the thin films growth, resulting in GZO electrode with conductivity greater than 4000 S/cm and transparency greater than 90 %. Similarly, various studies on research and development of  Indium Zinc Tin Oxide and Indium Zinc Oxide thin films which can be applied to flexible substrates  for next  generation solar cells application is presented. In these new TCO systems, understanding the role of crystallographic structure ranging from poly-crystalline to amorphous phase and the influence on the charge transport and optical transparency as well as important surface passivation and surface charge transport properties. 
      Implementation of these electrode based on ZnO  on opto-electronics devices such as OLED and OPV is complicated due to chemical interaction over time  with the organic layer or with ambient. The problem of inefficient charge collection/injection due to poor understanding of interface and/or bulk property of oxide electrode exists at several  oxide-organic interfaces.  The surface conductivity, the work function, the formation of dipoles and the band-bending at the interfacial sites can positively or negatively impact the device performance. Detailed characterization of the surface composition both before and after various chemicals treatment of various oxide electrode can therefore provide insight into optimization of device performance. Some of the work related to controlling the interfacial chemistry associated with charge transport of transparent electrodes are discussed. Thus, the role of various pre-treatment on poly-crystalline GZO electrode and amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) electrode is compared and contrasted.  From the study, we have found that removal of defects and self passivating defects caused by accumulation of hydroxides in the surface of both poly-crystalline GZO and amorphous IZO, are critical for improving the surface conductivity and charge transport. Further insight on how these insulating and self-passivating defects cause charge accumulation and recombination in an device is discussed. 
      With recent rapid development of bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics  active materials, devices employing ZnO and ZnO based electrode provide air stable and cost-competitive alternatives to traditional inorganic photovoltaics. The organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)  have already been commercialized, thus to follow in the footsteps  of this technology, OPV devices need further improvement in  power conversion efficiency and stable materials resulting in long device lifetimes. Use of low work function metals such as Ca/Al in standard geometry do provide good electrode for electron collection, but serious problems using low work-function metal electrodes originates from the  formation of non-conductive metal oxide due to oxidation resulting in rapid device failure. Hence, using low work-function, air stable, conductive metal oxides such as ZnO  as electrons collecting electrode  and high work-function, air stable metals such as silver  for harvesting holes, has been on the rise. 
      Devices with degenerately doped ZnO functioning as transparent conductive electrode, or  as charge selective layer in a polymer/fullerene based heterojunction, present useful device structures for investigating the functional mechanisms within OPV devices and a possible pathway towards improved air-stable high efficiency devices. Furthermore, analysis of the physical properties of the ZnO layers with varying thickness, crystallographic structure, surface chemistry and grain size deposited via various techniques such as atomic layer deposition, sputtering and solution-processed ZnO  with their respective OPV device performance is discussed. We find similarity and differences in electrode property for good charge injection in OLEDs and good charge collection in OPV devices very insightful in understanding physics behind device failures and successes. In general, self-passivating surface of amorphous TCOs IZO, ZTO and IZTO forms insulating layer that hinders  the charge collection. Similarly, we find modulation of the carrier concentration and the mobility in electron transport layer, namely zinc oxide thin films, very important for optimizing device performance.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Islamic Political Thought: Reviving a Rationalist Tradition</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This work develops the foundations of an Islamic argument for secular, liberal democracy from within the Islamic discursive tradition. First, it challenges the presentation of contemporary Islamic political thought as a unified, continuous development of the classical canon by showing the influence of the now marginalized medieval rationalists in the development of Islamic political thought. The classical rationalist concern with divine justice forced the founders of Sunni orthodoxy to state their epistemologies and their positions on ethical ontology. The orthodox positions, and their related methods of legal-juristic reasoning, are shown to be incapable of accommodating the modern Islamic positions on political representation, slavery, and just war. This leads to the second argument of the work, that the modern Islamic discourse is better understood as a reflection of the central concern with justice and its rationalist epistemology and ethical ontology we find in the writings of classical rationalists. This argument is made by examining the works of three classical rationalists, a theologian, a philosopher, and a historian. Their political positions, shaped by their rationalism and concern with justice, challenged their orthodox contemporaries, and provide substantive critiques of the classical political accommodations, methods of politico-legal reasoning, and hence, of modern Islamist political projects. The final chapter reveals how far the mainstream of Islamic political thought has deviated from the classical discourses, since the 19th century, by adopting the language and ideals of the European Enlightenment. This shift is presented as a triumph of classical rationalism over literalism, whose epistemological foundations and ontological implications have yet to be acknowledged and appreciated.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Simulation versus Online Learning: Effects on Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Retention, and Perceived Effectiveness</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The healthcare environment continues to experience rapid changes requiring nursing professionals to update knowledge and technical skills to provide safe patient care. The result is a need for healthcare facilities to find unique, evidence-based teaching methods to support learning. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and perceived effectiveness of two teaching strategies. Nurses participating in the study were randomized to either a high fidelity simulation experience or an online learning module to complete continuing education about a hypoglycemic protocol. After taking a pre-test, participants completed a learning session and then took the first post-test. Approximately four weeks later, a second post-test was completed that included questions about the application of the protocol in clinical practice. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.
      There were no significant differences between the learning strategy groups related to demographic variables, mean test scores, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, or perceived effectiveness of the learning strategy. Both groups showed a significant amount of knowledge gain (p = 0.00) and both groups lost knowledge after the learning sessions with the online group, demonstrating a statistically significant loss (p = 0.027). Qualitative analysis of responses to open-ended questions identified three themes:hands-on learning is helpful (simulation group), online learning is effective (online group), and education is applied in practice (both groups).

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Eruv</dc:title>
  <dc:description>Eruv is a collection of poems exploring the interstices between the Judaic concept of Eruvin and the poetic traditions of dictation, field and personist poetics. The poems that represent the body of this work are explorations of the ways in which poetry empties and fills a space, and what might be implied for our shared conceptions of ‘Home’ and ‘Self’ by these tendencies.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Performing the personal within the organizational: Communicating professional identities through Taiwanese commercial airline pilots&apos; personal narratives</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation project explored professionalism and the performance of identities by examining Taiwanese commercial airline pilots&apos; discursive practices in everyday life. The intentions for this project were to not only expand current knowledge of organizational communication from a critical rhetorical perspective, but to further explore the under-appreciated concept of professionalism of organizational members. Theoretically, I traced theoretical analysis in the sociology of professions and further investigated scholarship from identity research in organizational communication studies. This research agenda helped to advance communication-based understandings of the meanings and practices of professional identity as a complement to the sociological conception. I further merged a performance paradigm and critical rhetorical perspective to examine the discursive practices of organizational members and to challenge the bias of traditional textual approaches. Methodologically, I conducted ethnographic interviews with Taiwanese commercial airline pilots in order to understand how they construct their personal, social, and professional identities. Five narrative themes were identified and demonstrated in this project: (1) It takes a lot to become a commercial airline pilot, (2) Being a professional commercial airline pilot is to build up sufficient knowledge, beyond average skill, and correct attitude, (3) Pilots&apos; resistance and dissent toward company management, (4) Popular (re)presentation influences professionalism, (5) Power and fear affect professionalism. Pilots&apos; personal narratives were presented in performative writing and in poetic transcription to make word alive with sounds featuring their meanings. Their personal storytelling created a dialogic space to not only let pilots&apos; voice to be heard but also revealed how identities are created within and against a larger organizational identity. Overall, this project demonstrated the interdisciplinary examination of the meanings, functions, and consequence of discursive practices in everyday professional life. It also critiqued relationships between power, domination, and resistance while reintroducing the roles of the body and materiality in the domain of professionalism, and provides ethical readings of larger and complex organizational cultures. Applying communication-oriented analysis to study professionalism indeed challenged the long time neglected phenomena regarding the power of the symbolic in sociological approaches and raised the awareness of structural, material, and bodily condition of work.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Sense-Making Bodies: Feminist Materiality and Phenomenology in Constructive Body Theologies</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Constructive body theology provides an ethical commitment to and a set of analytical principles for understanding bodily experience. If we insist upon the theological value of embodied experience, how can we give an adequate account of it? Are feminist appeals to the senses useful in developing theological truth claims based in embodied experiences? Feminist theologies which explicitly seek to overcome body/mind dualisms often reinscribe them when they neglect to attend to perception as a critical element of bodily experience.  Phenomenological analyses of perception (such as suggested by Merleau-Ponty) strengthen and refine our conception of embodiment. Grounding constructive theology in experience requires understanding experience as bodily perceptual orientation, as perceptual bodily and cultural acts involved in socially and historically situated contextual meaning-making processes. This shift expands phenomenological concepts such as intentionality and habit, and allows for a comparative investigation of historical and cultural differences in embodied experiences through examples found in sensory anthropology. Body theology, framed as principles, strengthens theological projects (such as those by Carter Heyward and Marcella Althaus-Reid, as well as new constructive possibilities) through opening dialogical avenues of exploration into embodied being in the world.  Body theology principles help us conceive of and address how our bodily experiencing--our feeling, tasting, hearing, imaging, remembering and other sensory knowledge --comes to matter in our lives, especially where oppressive forces viscerally affect embodied life.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Evolution of Melanocortin-2 Receptor Activations: Studies on a Mammal and a Fish</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The structure and function relationship between melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) and ACTH are the most complicated in melanocortin receptor gene family. A comparative study on the activation of human and rainbow trout MC2R will provide a useful model system for understanding how ACTH emerged as the sole ligand for the MC2R of bony vertebrates. This dissertation will discuss how studies utilizing analogs of hACTH(1-24) have revealed two critical amino acid motifs in this ligand (HFRW and KKRRP) which are required for the activation of MC2R. In addition, the KKRRP motif functioned as the unique binding site for MC2R that directly contributes to the ligand selectivity feature, as revealed from studies on an ACTH antagonist which exclusively targets MC2R. Finally, based on our model for the interaction of ACTH and MC2R, the amino acid residues within TM4, EC2, and TM5 domains responsible for ACTH ligand selectivity will be evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis studies.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Addressing Roman Jews: Paul&apos;s View on the Law in the Letter to the Romans</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For many years, Pauline scholars have wrestled with two related questions: (1) how did Paul envision the composition of the audience for his letter to Rome? (2) What did Paul see as the role of the Law in the community of Jesus followers? As to the first question, I contend that Paul wrote to an implied audience composed of non-Judeans who had first converted to Judaism and then acknowledge Jesus as Messiah, or who became Jews at the time of their acceptance of Jesus as Messiah. In either case, they adopted the beliefs and practices of the followers of Jesus within the pracrtices of Judaism. I refer to this audience as non-Judean, Jewish Jesus followers. I support the historical plausibility of this reconstruction of the audience through a review of the history of the Judeans in Rome including the development of the community of Jesus followers in that city. My reconstruction of the audience is demonstrated through my reading of Paul&apos;s rhetoric in Rom and his emphasis throughout the letter on establishing himself as a member of the Jewish in-group.
      Paul&apos;s position on the Law follows from that audience and the purpose for Paul&apos;s writing to Rome. With many others, I read Rom as a letter seeking assistance from Roman Jesus followers for future missionary activities (his collection for the community in Jerusalem and/or his establishment of a missionary presence in Spain). As a petitioner, Paul wrote a conciliatory letter. Writing to an audience of Jewish Jesus followers, Paul carefully sets out his understanding of the relationship among all Jews (Jesus followers or no), his congregations in the East (composed of non-Judean, non-Jewish Jesus followers), and the Law. Paul reiterates in Rom that the provisions of the Sinai covenant distinctive to Jews do not apply to non-Jews. It is through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, as foretold in Scriptures, which themselves constitute part of the Law, that non-Judean, non-Jewish Jesus followers are brought into the family of Abraham and into righteous relations with the God of Israel. The Law therefore remains in force for all Jesus followers.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Chinese Intellectuals and China`s Policy toward Japan</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation aims at integrating two scholarships: state-society relation studies and Chinese foreign policy analysis. I created Two-level Perception Gap Model to analyze different intellectual groups&apos; relations with party-state by confirming Chinese intellectuals play a role in CFP making in general, China&apos;s Japan policy in particular. This model is an alternative approach, instead of conventional wisdom patron-client approach, to explain and analyze the pluralized intellectual-state relations in China. This model first analyzed the role of two intellectual groups, namely think tank scholars and popular nationalist, in China&apos;s Japan policy making, and then based on these analyses it explains the interactional patterns between these two intellectual groups and party-state. I used three case studies, which represented different types of issue, Chinese attitude toward the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Japanese defense policy, the controversy over the Yasukuni Shrine Visit, and the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, to examine this model. 
      First, I examined think tank scholar groups and the extent they influenced &quot;core interest issue and sensitive issue (Issue 1),&quot; Chinese attitude toward the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Japanese defense policy, and their international patterns with party-state. Chapter 3 compares the responses of Chinese officials to the changes in the defense policy of Japan to the analyses from the think tank scholars. As the model assumes, results show that think tank scholars&apos; analyses are consistent with China&apos;s policy position; nevertheless, it is difficult to confirm their analyses have influence on Chinese attitude toward the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Japanese defense policy. Based on the analysis of journal articles, most articles do not provide policy suggestions or simply provide suggestions that do not deviate from the policy. As Gu&apos;s theory of pluralist institutionalism and my hypothesis points out, most think tank scholars are establishment intellectuals so they tend to be self-disciplined. 
      Second, this model provide a new concept &quot;patriotic dilemma&quot; for analyzing the challenge and constraints brought by popular nationalist discourses and public mobilization to Chinese foreign policy decision makers. Chapter 4 investigated the cases study of the controversy over the Yasukuni Shrine Visit, defined as &quot;major/minor interest issue/ sensitive issue (Issue 3),&quot; and the discourses from the popular nationalist, mainly focusing on anti-Japanese activists. The chapter also observes their influence on nationalist public opinions and analyzes how the nationalist public opinions constrain the policy choices among decision makers. Results strongly supported the hypothesis of patriotic dilemma that, although the popular nationalist group and public opinions constrained the policy choices of Chinese decision makers in the short term, they were unable to change the fundamental policy direction. Third, chapter 5 also focuses on anti-Japanese activists and examines the model with the case of the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. The result supported that hypothesis that China&apos;s policy change was not because of the influence from popular nationalist&apos;s discourses or public opinions but because of the change of priority of this issue, from major/minor interest issue to core interest issue. These two chapters also indicate that the patron-client model is unable to describe the popular nationalist. An alternative approach, such as the concept &quot;patriotic dilemma&quot; is needed to describe the relations between the popular nationalist and the government.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Monetary Effervescence: A Sociological Theory of Religion Applied to Money</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This project attempts to answer the question &quot;What holds the construction of money together?&quot; by asserting that it is money&apos;s religious nature which provides the moral compulsion for people to use, and continue to uphold, money as a socially constructed concept. This project is primarily descriptive and focuses on the religious nature of money by employing a sociological theory of religion in viewing money as a technical concept. This is an interdisciplinary work between religious studies, economics, and sociology and draws heavily from Emile Durkheim&apos;s &apos;The Elementary Forms of Religious Life&apos; as well as work related to heterodox theories of money developed by Geoffrey Ingham, A. Mitchell Innes, and David Graeber.
      Two new concepts are developed: the idea of monetary sacrality and monetary effervescence, both of which serve to recharge the religious saliency of money. By developing the concept of monetary sacrality, this project shows how money acts to interpret our economic relations while also obfuscating complex power dynamics in society, making them seem naturally occurring and unchangeable. The project also shows how our contemporary fractional reserve banking system contributes to money&apos;s collective effervescence and serves to animate economic acting within a monetary network. The project concludes by outlining multiple implications for religious studies, economics, sociology, and central banking.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Towards the Consideration of the U.S. Community College Model to Address the Need for Higher Education  Reforms in Ghana</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      ABSTRACT
      The higher education systems throughout the continent of Africa are undergoing unprecedented challenges and are considered in crisis. African countries, including Ghana, all have in common ties to their colonial legacy whereby they are confronted with weak policies put in place by their colonizers. Having gained their independence, Africans should now take responsibility for the task of reforming their higher education system. To date, nothing substantial has been accomplished, with serious implications for weakening and damaging the structures of the foundation of their educational systems. This qualitative, single case study utilized a postcolonial theory-critical pedagogy framework, providing guidance for coming to grips with the mindset posed by Ghana&apos;s colonial heritage in the postcolonial era, especially in terms of its damaging effects on Ghana&apos;s higher education system. The study explores alternative pathways for secondary school students to transition to tertiary education--a problematic transition that currently hinders open access to all and equality in educational opportunity, resulting in a tremendous pool of discontinued students.  This transitional problem is directly related to Ghana&apos;s crisis in higher education with far reaching consequences. The alternative pathway considered in this study is an adaptation of the U.S. community college model or an integration of its applicable aspects into the current structures of the higher education system already in place. In-depth interviews were conducted with 5 Ghanaian professors teaching at community colleges in the United States, 5 Ghanaian professors teaching at universities in Ghana, and 2 educational consultants from the Ghanaian Ministry of Education. Based on their perspectives of the current state of Ghanaian higher education, analyzed in terms of pedagogy, structure/infrastructure, and curriculum, the participants provided their perceptions of salient aspects of the U.S. community college model that would be applicable to Ghana&apos;s situation, along with other recommendations. Access to all, including equality of educational opportunity, was considered essential, followed by adaptability, affordability, practicality, and quality of curriculum content and delivery. Canada&apos;s successful adaptation of the U.S. model was also discussed. Findings can help guide consideration of alternative pathways to higher education in Ghana and Africa as a whole.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Biophysical Approaches to Human Genetic Disease: ADSL Deficiency as a Model</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Biophysical tools are becoming more useful in approaching human genetic disease.  The pathogenic mechanisms behind many disorders have been attributed to protein loss of function or gain in toxic function.  For example, changes in the protein Adenylosuccinate Lyase (ADSL) lead to ADSL deficiency, a disorder that causes symptoms ranging from epilepsy to expression of autistic features.  Biophysics offers different tools to study intrinsic properties of proteins.  We have applied such tools to study the enzyme kinetics and protein stability of ADSL and two mutations (R426H and R303C) to formulate better hypotheses regarding the pathogenic mechanism.  Enzyme kinetic findings indicate a) non-linear dependences of the activities on the substrate ratios due to competitive binding and b) distinct differences in the behaviors of the different mutations.  Preliminary stability measurements indicate a) there is an intermediate state in the folding pathway  and a fourth state is necessary for modeling,  b) R426H, a mutation that causes severe phenotypes, is less stable, c) there is no evidence of a gain in toxic function for either mutation.  This complete work supports our hypothesis that there are multiple mechanisms of pathogenesis of ADSL deficiency including instability of the functional ADSL tetramer, aggregation of ADSL, or diminution of enzyme activity. The significance of this is that development of an effective therapy may depend upon which mechanism is active in a particular patient.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Mental health literacy of Latina women in the United States for their school-aged children</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Despite known mental health (MH) disparities faced by Latino children relative to children from other minority groups of similar socioeconomic status (SES), little is known about how Latina mothers make MH decisions for their children. The present study examined links between Latina mothers&apos; mental health literacy (MHL), including the recognition of and response to child psychiatric symptoms, and maternal acculturation factors as well as interpersonal violence (IPV) related symptomatology. Participants were 80 Latina mothers from Denver, Colorado and Modesto, California with at least one child between the ages of 8-12 years. Mothers were presented vignettes depicting child internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as interviewed about their help seeking behaviors. Maternal acculturation was not related to identification of disorders, but was related to more symptoms recognized for child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Acculturation predicted use of formal source of care for child internalizing and externalizing disorder. Women demonstrated a preference for informal source of care, with the exception of IPV-related child symptoms, where women demonstrated a preference for formal source of care. IPV-related symptoms did not moderate the relationship between acculturation and MHL. The relationship between maternal acculturation, IPV related symptomatology and their combined effect on MHL for child psychiatric disorders are discussed.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Mental Health Outcomes of First Generation College Students: Is Generational Status Associated with Increased Risk for Depression and Anxiety?</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there were differences in mental health outcomes between first generation college students and non-first generation college students. The sample (n = 6,449) consisted of undergraduate students, aged 18-22, in bachelor&apos;s degree programs, and was drawn from 15 colleges and universities throughout the United States. Acculturative stress was used as a theoretical framework for why first generation college students (pioneers) may screen higher in prevalence and severity of mental health outcomes. The particular mental health outcomes examined in this study were the prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety. The results revealed that pioneers did not screen higher in prevalence or severity of depression or anxiety than non-first generation students (legacy students). However, students who had at least one parent who attended college, but did not graduate (partial legacy students), screened higher for prevalence of anxiety, severity of anxiety, and prevalence of minor depression than legacy students. These results were also significant when partial legacy students were combined with pioneers. The findings suggest that there may be risk factors for depression and anxiety that are unique to partial legacy students. Implications of these findings are that colleges and universities should be aware that partial legacy students may be at risk for mental health problems-a group that has not been previously identified as at risk. Further implications point to the possibility that pioneers who attend college may represent a more resilient group of students. Limitations include the lack of stratification of generational status by year in school, the limitations of the outcome measures, the subjective measure of financial situation, and restricting the sample age range from 18-22. Future research could include measures of resiliency and acculturative stress when examining mental health outcomes by generational status.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) The role of the social environment in non-suicidal self-injury among LGBTQ youth: A mixed methods study</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), such as cutting and burning, is a widespread social problem among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth.  Extant research indicates that this population is more than twice as likely to engage in NSSI than heterosexual and cisgender (non-transgender) youth.  Despite the scope of this social problem, it remains relatively unexamined in the literature.  Research on other risk behaviors among LGBTQ youth indicates that experiencing homophobia and transphobia in key social contexts such as families, schools, and peer relationships contributes to health disparities among this group.  Consequently, the aims of this study were to examine: (1) the relationship between LGBTQ youth&apos;s social environments and their NSSI behavior, and (2) whether/how specific aspects of the social environment contribute to an understanding of NSSI among LGBTQ youth.   
      This study was conducted using an exploratory, sequential mixed methods design with two phases.  The first phase of the study involved analysis of transcripts from interviews conducted with 44 LGBTQ youth recruited from a community-based organization.  In this phase, five qualitative themes were identified: (1) Violence; (2) Misconceptions, Stigma, and Shame; (3) Negotiating LGBTQ Identity; (4) Invisibility and Isolation; and (5) Peer Relationships.  Results from the qualitative phase were used to identify key variables and specify statistical models in the second, quantitative, phase of the study, using secondary data from a survey of 252 LGBTQ youth.  The qualitative phase revealed how LGBTQ youth, themselves, described the role of the social environment in their NSSI behavior, while the quantitative phase was used to determine whether the qualitative findings could be used to predict engagement in NSSI among a larger sample of LGBTQ youth.  The quantitative analyses found that certain social-environmental factors such as experiencing physical abuse at home, feeling unsafe at school, and greater openness about sexual orientation significantly predicted the likelihood of engaging in NSSI among LGBTQ youth.  Furthermore, depression partially mediated the relationships between family physical abuse and NSSI and feeling unsafe at school and NSSI.  The qualitative and quantitative results were compared in the interpretation phase to explore areas of convergence and incongruence.  Overall, this study&apos;s findings indicate that social-environmental factors are salient to understanding NSSI among LGBTQ youth.  The particular social contexts in which LGBTQ youth live significantly influence their engagement in this risk behavior.  These findings can inform the development of culturally relevant NSSI interventions that address the social realities of LGBTQ youth&apos;s lives.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Attentional processes associated with victimization history and posttraumatic symptomatology in women exposed to intimate partner violence</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) puts women at risk for severe and chronic physical and mental health consequences, including elevations in IPV-related psychopathology and increased risk for future victimization.  Previous research has examined attention as one of the key information processing mechanisms associated with elevated psychopathology and risk for victimization; however, the nature of attentional processing in response to IPV-related information in women exposed to IPV is poorly understood.  Therefore, the current study aimed to further understanding of associations between attentional processing, IPV exposure, and related distress using measures of eye movement and subjective interpretations of IPV-related information.  A sample of women exposed to IPV (n = 57) viewed sets of negative, positive, and neutral relationship images for 15 s each while having their eye movements monitored and later provided subjective ratings and interpretations of levels of risk and safety in those images.  We examined associations of outcome measures with proximal victimization experiences and IPV-related psychopathology (i.e., depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and dissociation).  Results indicated a bias to attend to negative relationship images relative to positive and neutral images, though this attention bias fluctuated over time and varied as a function of symptomatology such that depression corresponded with increases in attention to negative images over time and PTSD corresponded with decreases in attention to negative images.  The general attention bias for negative images appeared to be explained by rumination on and/or difficulty disengaging from negative images, which was related to general elevations in psychopathology as well as exposure to revictimization by different perpetrators.  Subjective interpretations and perception of danger cues were related to victimization history and level and type of IPV-related distress.  We replicated these procedures with a sample of undergraduate students without IPV histories or related symptomatology (n = 33) and found that the overall attention bias for negative images was not replicated, despite general similarities in patterns of attention over time.  Results therefore indicated associations between attentional processing and IPV exposure and related symptomatology.  Implications for models of IPV-related psychopathology and attentional processing as well as directions for future study and interventions are discussed.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) The X-ray and Spectropolarimetric View of Mass Loss and Transfer in Massive Binary Stars</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The majority of massive stars are members of binary systems. In order to have a better understanding of their evolutionary pathways, the mass and angular momentum loss from massive binaries needs to be well understood. Self consistent explanations for their behavior need to be valid across many wavelength regimes in order to illuminate key phases of mass loss to completely determine how it affects their evolution. In this dissertation I present the results of X-ray and specropolarimetric studies on one Roche-lobe overflow binary (&amp;beta; Lyr) and two colliding wind binaries (V444 Cyg and WR 140). 
      In &amp;beta; Lyr a repeatable discrepancy between the secondary eclipse in total and polarized light indicates that an accretion hot spot has formed on the edge of the disk in the system. This hot spot may also be the source of the bipolar outflows within the system. The existence of a hot spot and its relationship to bipolar outflows is important in understanding the mass transfer dynamics of Roche-lobe overflow binaries. 
      The absorption of the 2.0 keV spectral fit component in V444 Cyg suggests that the shock has a large opening angle while analysis of the X-ray light curves places the stagnation point farther away from the O star than theoretically expected. Combining this with evidence of polarimetric variability in V444 Cyg&apos;s optical emission lines shows that the effects of radiative inhibition or braking are significant for this close binary and may be important in other colliding wind systems.
      Long term X-ray monitoring of the shock formed by the winds in WR 140 shows conflicting evidence for unexpected intrinsic hard X-ray emission. Spectral analysis shows that the low energy thermal tail is causing the observed higher energy emission. On the other hand, light curve analysis of the absorption feature near periastron passage suggests that there may be intrinsic hard X-ray emission from the system. WR 140&apos;s polarimetric behavior is consistent with the formation of dust near periastron passage, better polarimetric monitoring of the system is needed. 
      The work presented in this dissertation is one small step toward a better understanding of the processes involved in mass loss in binary systems. Continued studies of these three objects, in addition to other important systems, will provide important new constraints on the mass loss structures that influence the future evolution of massive binary systems.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Celestial Paleontology: The Legacy of Dying Stars</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      In their death throes, stars dole out their atmospheric material to the interstellar medium in dramatic stellar winds and spectacular explosions. The details of this profound metamorphosis, from star to remnant, play a key role in the next generation of star formation as well as the energetic and chemical evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole. Dying stars are thought to be the source of all of the nuclei heavier than iron in the universe, as well as more complex molecules, such as carbon chains, which form the backbone of life as we know it.
      High mass Wolf-Rayet stars are likely progenitors of many types of Supernova, yet  due to observational constraints we lack the most basic information about most of them: rather they are part of binary systems.  This information is key to the determination of rather or not these stars will go supernova, since depending on its nature the companion can either draw mass off the Wolf-Rayet star, effectively quenching the march to explosion, or feed material onto the Wolf-Rayet star, speeding its demise as a supernova.  Models of galactic evolution depend sensitively on the frequency of supernova for several reasons: they inject a great deal of energy into the Interstellar medium, they are the only known producers of nuclei heavier than nickel, and the shock waves that they create can stimulate star formation.  In turn, the energy generated by supernova explosions drives the galactic wind, the heavier elements now present in the Interstellar Medium increase the efficiency of star formation, and the groups of new stars formed in the wake of a shock are thought to lead to the development of spiral arms in galaxies.  In addition, because high mass stars are so short-lived, they can cycle through hundreds of generations in the time it takes one solar-type star&apos;s to evolve.
      Though intermediate mass stars merely fizzle out in comparison, they are pivotal to the evolution of the universe because they make up over 97% of the stars that have had enough time to evolve off the Main Sequence since the Big Bang. These stars produce more than half of the carbon in the universe as well as much of the nitrogen, oxygen, and more complex molecules such as aromatic rings of carbon. This process, often referred to as chemical enrichment, strongly affects the star formation rates and the characteristics of the next generation of stars.
      In this work, we explore the contributions of these two classes of stars to our own galaxy:  we quantify the nature of the chemical enrichment to the Milky Way from a large sample of intermediate mass stars, and determine the binary status of a sample of Wolf-Rayet stars in the Milky Way.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Asthma Stability and Severity</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States. Asthma affects about one in fifteen people. It affects children more than adults and blacks more than whites. People with asthma experience attacks of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma can be fatal and the costs for the disease (direct and indirect) are approximated to be tens of billions of dollars each year. 
          There is no cure for asthma. However; for most people if asthma is controlled well they can lead normal, active lives. Therefore asthma controllability is a main factor in clinical practice. In order to control asthma, the disease has to be completely understood. Asthma is very heterogeneous and this makes the exact diagnosis and control procedures difficult. To better evaluate and study asthma, mathematical tools can be very beneficial. 
          In this study we first develop a complete system for lung impedance analysis of laboratory models of asthma. Our designed system is capable of precisely diagnosing the diseased models and predicting the severity of their condition. We also evaluate the treatment progress in mouse models of asthma.  We then study an asthma database of humans including measurements of four related laboratory parameters and cluster patients based on inherent properties of the study variables.  This mathematical approach clustered patients with specific characteristics and segregated the unstable asthmatic patients in a single group. Our method is very promising in predicting the instability of asthma, which is highly correlated with frequent asthma attacks and increased utilization of care.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Resilience through Adversity: A narrative case study of students&apos; experiences of expulsion from school</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Expulsion from school is life changing. This single event can alter the trajectory of a student&apos;s life--for better or for worse. How life changes is unique for each individual student. Risk and protective factors that impact an individual student&apos;s resilience determine the level of positive or negative outcomes experienced as a result of expulsion. Educators have the opportunity to take advantage of this disruption in students&apos; education to improve the trajectory of students&apos; lives. However, without thoughtful intervention from caring educators, this interruption in students&apos; education may have an irreparable destructive impact on students&apos; future. The purpose of this study was to understand the expulsion experience from the point of view of the student in order to represent this critical stakeholder group in future policy and program development, implementation, and decision-making. Students&apos; narratives are a means for members of the educational community to access students&apos; experiences and perceptions in order to understand the impact of expulsion on students&apos; lives. Students&apos; perspectives are presented through thick description in this narrative case study. The experience of these eight students is evidence that expulsion can change students&apos; lives in a positive way. Knowing this, responsible educators must develop interventions for expelled students that channel the positive life-changing potential of this experience. Educators must develop interventions focused on bringing forth protective factors that are documented to increase resilience and to make students less susceptible to the risks inherent in removing them from school. Recommendations for educators and policy-makers are presented to assist educators in preventing expulsion and improving educational and socio-emotional outcomes for expelled students.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) The Relationships Between Executive Function and Positive Reappraisal Abilities in Adulthood</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Positive reappraisal, a type of emotion regulation that involves cognitively reframing negative information in a positive light, has been shown to promote resilience in stressed individuals (i.e., it decreases depression and enhances well-being). The ability to use positive reappraisal (PRA) varies widely across individuals, raising the question of which cognitive functions might support this ability. Only a few studies have investigated this question, and they have not yet examined the relationships between PRA and executive functions that involve emotional materials (&quot;valence-specific executive functions;&quot; EF). The first part of the present study examined the relationships between PRA and two types of valence-specific EF theorized to be involved in PRA: inhibition of negative information and working memory for positive information. A community sample of 250 men and women (age 18 to 72 years) completed a PRA task and several valence-specific EF tasks. Results indicated no associations between PRA and valence-specific EF. To take a step further, the second part of the study investigated whether age moderated the relationships between PRA and valence-specific EF. Previous studies have documented decline in cognitive function but well-preserved emotional function in old age. This raises the question of whether the relationships between PRA and valence-specific EF change as a function of age. Regression analyses indicated an interaction between age and inhibition of negative information, such that older adults with better inhibition of negative information demonstrated higher PRA, whereas younger adults with better inhibition of negative information showed lower PRA. These results have important implications for understanding how valence-specific EF supports PRA in adulthood. Potential explanations, methodological and theoretical implications, and future directions are discussed.

  <dc:title>The Influence of Gender and Alcohol Use On Depressive Symptoms Among Men and Women</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study investigated the extent to which gender influences self-reported prototypical and masculine-specific symptoms of depression in men and women and whether or not alcohol mediates this relationship. Secondly, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the Denver Comprehensive Depression Inventory (DCDI), in measuring prototypical and masculine-specific depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical samples of men and women. 
      This paper summarizes the literature on gender differences in depression and the assessment of depression and gender, and outlines the current research on masculine-specific depression. It is argued that current assessment instruments identify prototypical symptoms of depression, as outlined in the DSM-IV-TR, but do not assess for masculine-specific symptoms of depression. Next, this paper outlines the methodology of the study, including participants, procedures, measures and data analyses, followed by the results and a discussion of the findings.

  <dc:title>Trauma-focused Involvement in Psycohotherapy: Relations with Therapeutic Alliance andSymptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</dc:title>
  <dc:description> Childhood trauma is a risk factor for a wide range of psychopathology and other damaging outcomes later in life (Cohen, Mannarino, Murray, &amp; Igleman, 2006; Saunders, 2003). Among the many treatment models developed for maltreated youth and their families, both specific and non-specific therapeutic factors such as developing a trauma narrative (e.g., trauma self-disclosure) and forming a strong therapeutic alliance have been identified as ―active ingredients‖ that contribute to positive treatment outcome (Cohen &amp; Mannarino, 1996a, 1998a; Friedrich, 1990). The current study used data from the Aurora-Adolescent Mood Project, a community based randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioral treatment for adolescents with depression and prior interpersonal trauma experience. This study used the same participants from the Aurora-Adolescent Mood Project to evaluate an observational coding system (Trauma Involvement Rating scale - TIRS) for trauma-focused involvement within therapy sessions. The sample consisted of 29 participants between the ages of 12 and 18 with a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder (Major Depressive Disorder (n = 23), Dysthymic Disorder (n = 2), or Depressive Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (n=4). 142 segments that were flagged as having trauma-focused discussion from 29 cases were evaluated for level of involvement. It was hypothesized that the association between pre-treatment PTSD-Avoidance symptoms and trauma-focused involvement in therapy would be moderated by the therapeutic alliance. Hierarchical regression did not reveal a significant interaction between PTSD-Avoidance symptoms and therapeutic alliance in predicting mean trauma-focused involvement. In order to further explore adolescents&apos; involvement in trauma-focused discussion separate from the therapist contribution, TIRS item one (Does the adolescent initiate discussion or introduce topics related to his or her trauma experience) was examined individually. Using linear regression, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and PTSD-Avoidance symptoms significantly predicted adolescent initiation of trauma-focused discussion. These results indicate that the higher level of symptomatology and distress present at pre-treatment the more frequently adolescents are going to initiate discussion about interpersonal trauma they have experienced. Overall, this study was the first to investigate trauma-focused involvement using an observational coding system with a community sample of depressed adolescents who had experienced interpersonal trauma. Future research should continue to utilize observational coding methods to analyze trauma-focused involvement with a larger sample of youths who have experienced interpersonal trauma.

  <dc:title>Longitudinal Interplay of Dating Anxiety and Romantic Cognitions and Behaviors from Adolescence to Young Adulthood</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Dating is normative in adolescence and young adulthood, but can be disrupted and distressing to individuals experiencing dating anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral theories suggest dating anxiety impacts romantic cognitions and behaviors, and romantic cognitions and behaviors impact dating anxiety. Thus far, investigators have been unable to explore the interplay between dating anxiety and romantic cognitions and behaviors because studies are limited by cross-sectional designs. The present study examined longitudinal associations between two types of dating anxiety (dating interactions and active intentions for dating) and romantic appeal, jealousy, and compliance during conflict. Two hundred adolescents participated in the study, which began in the 10th grade and continued for nearly eight years. Autoregressive latent trajectory models revealed appeal, jealousy and compliance were concurrently associated with dating anxiety from adolescence to young adulthood. These cognitions and behaviors also predicted changes in dating anxiety during adolescence and young adulthood, but not vice versa, with one exception. There was some evidence that anxiety predicts an increase in jealousy over time. The findings suggest cognitive modifications of romantic appeal and jealousy as well as social skills interventions to reduce jealous behavior and submissive compliance during conflict could have ongoing benefits for dating anxious individuals. Bidirectional associations between active intentions anxiety and jealousy also highlight jealousy&apos;s role in maintaining anxiety. This study moves the field toward an ultimate goal of enabling adolescents and young adults with dating anxiety to initiate, develop, and maintain beneficial romantic relationships.

  <dc:title>Mitochondrial Glutathione Transport: Implications for Bcl-2 and Neuronal Survival</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Oxidative stress is a contributing factor to many neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, mitochondria are a key source of oxidative stress due to electron leakage at the level of the electron transport chain. To combat the endogenous production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species mitochondria are equipped with several redox-cycling systems, such as glutathione (GSH). Mitochondrial GSH has been shown to be a critical reservoir of this antioxidant, where selective depletion of mitochondrial GSH can induce apoptosis in several systems. Many studies have intricately linked Bcl-2 to cellular GSH status and it has been previously shown that Bcl-2 is a GSH binding protein. Therefore, we hypothesize that Bcl-2 may play an important role in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport. 
      Here, we show that inhibition of Bcl-2 in primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) induced apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress, selective depletion of the mitochondrial GSH pool, and led to inhibition of mitochondrial GSH transport.  Furthermore, we found that Bcl-2 is an interacting partner with a previously identified mitochondrial GSH transporter, the 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), and this interaction is modulated by GSH. To further support a role for Bcl-2 in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport, we show that Bcl-2 requires OGC for protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and to increase the mitochondrial GSH pool. These data suggest that Bcl-2 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport and that the enhancement of the interaction between Bcl-2 and OGC by GSH may increase mitochondrial GSH transport.  
      The mechanisms of mitochondrial GSH transport thus far have only been extensively studied in liver and kidney, where the OGC and the dicarboxylate (DIC) carrier have been identified as inner membrane mitochondrial GSH transporters. Most studies examining mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms in brain have not allowed for the distinction between neuronal and glial cell mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms. Therefore, we employed primary cerebellar astrocytes and primary CGNs as a system to study mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms and differences between neuronal and glial cells. It was found that cerebellar astrocytes use both the OGC and DIC to transport GSH into mitochondria, while CGNs preferentially use the DIC. In addition, discrete inhibition of one mitochondrial GSH transporter (DIC) using chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown, in CGNs, led to increased susceptibility to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. Overall, this suggests that inhibition of a single mitochondrial GSH transporter is sufficient to predispose neurons to oxidative stress, such as the conditions observed in neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Finally, the consequences of overexpressing a mitochondrial GSH transporter were examined. Stable NSC34 motor neuron- like cell lines were produced which overexpress OGC. The stable OGC cell lines had significantly increased mitochondrial GSH levels and were markedly resistant to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. More importantly, the stable OGC cell lines up-regulated Bcl-2 expression (a protein we have shown previously to interact with OGC) and this phenomenon was due to increased mitochondrial GSH levels. The up-regulation of Bcl-2 was required to sustain increased mitochondrial GSH levels and resistance to oxidative stress. Overall, this study implicates the importance of not only the mitochondrial GSH pool, but mitochondrial GSH transport for neuronal survival. These findings suggest that modulation of 
      mitochondrial GSH transport could be a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

  <dc:title>Fresh Squeezed:The Dilemma of Local Food Production along Colorado&apos;s Front Range Urban Corridor</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Today, the Front Range Urban Corridor of Colorado is one example from the urban/agricultural battlefield. The history of food production and urbanization in this area is similar to many regions throughout the western United States. Originally an extraction based economy, Colorado later became agriculturally/pastorally based, and more recently became a service-based, urban economy. On the Front Range Urban Corridor specifically, the urban core of Denver and Boulder developed with rich agricultural lands toward the northeast to Weld County along the northern border of the state. Though a semi-arid region, this agricultural zone produces a volume and variety of food-based crops due to a vast irrigation network on the rich piedmont soils of the Platte River valley (Whitney 1983, Acevedo and Taylor 2006). Urban development, however, is overtaking agricultural areas as cities grow towards each other and spread out along transportation networks (Acevedo and Taylor 2006). Unfortunately, the same rich, flat, irrigated soil used to grow food is also favored by land developers and home owners. As development and food production are starting to challenge the finite limits of the land, there are choices to make regarding land, development, and local food production. By combining data from the U.S. Agricultural Census with results of an author-driven survey of local producers in Colorado, this project will consider these choices and illuminate the complex web of their interdependence. The principal results display that
      Colorado faces increasing competition for food production and urban development space potentially pressuring local food prices upward and forcing producers to peripheral land or out of food production.

  <dc:title>Faculty Engagement with Learning Outcomes Assessment: A Study of Public Two-Year Colleges in Colorado</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The problem addressed in this study was the assumption that faculty at the postsecondary level in the U. S. are not sufficiently or effectively engaged with student learning outcomes assessment (LOA) activities and/or practices. This issue emerged in two primary ways within the Scholarship of Assessment (SoA) body of literature: (1) as a misalignment of learning outcomes assessment practices between faculty and their institutions, and (2) as a lack of transparency concerning what faculty are, in fact, doing with respect to LOA activities. Two-year colleges reportedly have particular difficulty in discerning whether or not these issues impact institutional efforts to ensure effective assessment practices; thus, this study sought to determine if faculty perceptions about institutional conditions that presumably elicit greater engagement with LOA aligned with academic leaders&apos; perceptions within a community college system.
      A new survey measure was developed and tested to explore faculty and academic leaders&apos; perceptions on three newly established constructs, to examine the relationships between the three constructs, and to solicit faculty perceptions about their own levels of engagement with LOA practices. The new instrument was found to be both reliable and valid within the parameters of this study. Findings also reflected the presence of conditions that reportedly elicit greater faculty engagement, and that increased faculty engagement with LOA practices predicted achievement of effectiveness indicators for both faculty and academic leaders. A gap existed between groups concerning whether or not these conditions increased faculty engagement with LOA practices. Faculty demonstrated they were engaged in LOA practices considered to be effective and achieve institutional indicators for effectiveness, although part-time faculty were considered less engaged than full-time faculty. Gaps existed between faculty and their institutions concerning how to use LOA data to improve teaching and student learning, and how to communicate evidence of student learning to the wider community.

  <dc:title>Attrition in a Telephonic Intervention Program for Depressed, Low-Income Patients in a Primary Care Setting</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Telemental health interventions are currently being implemented in primary care settings in order to reduce the cost of providing treatment and increase access to services of underserved groups. Studies of the efficacy of telemental health interventions have generally demonstrated high rates of attrition. Eysenbach (2005) suggested that the reality of high attrition rates in telemental health studies prompts further investigation into the factors related to attrition. Such research should focus on identifying the characteristics of clients who drop out of treatment and at what points such clients are likely to drop out. The purpose of this study was to identify client characteristics associated with dropout from a telemental health intervention for depressed primary care patients. Clients who dropped out at different time points during the intervention were compared to determine whether they differed demographically or on certain baseline characteristics, including severity of depression, self-efficacy, acculturation, treatment expectancy, and co-morbid mental illness. In addition, differences in attrition rates between therapists were examined to determine whether observable therapist characteristics impacted retention in telemental health treatment. Results suggested that participant age and baseline depression scores, therapist age, and changes in participant depression scores over time were significant predictors of attrition from the intervention. Implications and comparisons of attrition in telemental health and traditional psychotherapy interventions are discussed.

  <dc:title>The Last Citizen--A Response to Rawls&apos;s Challenge on Impairment: A Third Principle of Justice, and Extra-Rational Contribution</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      John Rawls, in Political Liberalism, acknowledges that justice as fairness, as it stands, &quot;may fail&quot; to deliver justice to people with severe cognitive impairment.  He continues, &quot;How deep a fault this is must wait until the case itself can be examined.&quot;   The intent of this work, then, is to revisit Rawls&apos;s justice as fairness in light of intervening decades of disability consciousness and the emergence of competing theoretical constructs pertinent to the lives of people with impairment, specifically to people with an inability to reason or to reason fully, and determine whether new perspectives can expand its scope into a more comprehensive model.  
      A fully democratic theory of justice cannot exclude the &quot;hard cases,&quot; so in addition to Rawls&apos;s two principles of justice, the author will argue that a third principle of justice must be included to assure true democratic outcomes.  The new principle will state: All structures arising from the first two principles must be open to all human beings--fully inclusive--without exception.  The author expects that this third principle will be embraced by the reasonable and rational designers because it is in their self-interest to do so.  The concept of self-interest--that interest, which might sway a person&apos;s choices toward personally favorable outcomes--is seen, by this author, as inclusive of favorable outcomes for all people with whom the designer self-identifies.  Arenas of self-interest expand past the boundaries of an individual&apos;s actual person and past the confines of time, to encompass others, including one&apos;s future self, whose well-being is of such importance to the designer as to define her own well-being.  
      Rawls means to assure a form of empathetic behavior when he constructs the veil of ignorance.  In the original position, because the designer is veiled from all of his individual characteristics, Rawls forces consideration of the circumstances of every possible person the designer could be.  The designer must consider those of all possible ethnicities, cultures, genders, classes, economic brackets, endowments, and other individual characteristics.  Yet, the veil can never hide from the designer the fact that she can reason, and, if the designer were to make choices based on a narrow version of self-interest, the circumstances of people with cognitive impairment would remain unconsidered.  Yet, people actually act within a broader definition of self-interest.  The veiled designer cannot know if impairment affects his child or others with whom he identifies, nor can he know, given the nature of impairment, whether he will become impaired imminently or in the future.  The unpredictable and non-discriminating nature of impairment means that its lack of consideration in the original position will expose participants, who all have impairment in a potential state, to the consequences of policy, which fails to address circumstances that might define anyone&apos;s future.  Within an expanded notion of self-interest, the circumstances of people with severe cognitive and physical impairment will be represented because, among many reasons, it is personally advantageous for participants to do so.  
      The social relevance of people with cognitive impairment, the author will argue, highlights the need for a theoretical restructuring of concepts of contribution and value, beyond rationality, that would lead to a reconceived notion of rights-bearing status and positions of respect.  Can theory redefine personhood in a non-traditional way that can, but need not, include the ability to make moral choices, in order to extend value to previously excluded individuals, who nonetheless benefit society through extra-rational contribution?  The author will explore the contributions and subsequent value to society of people with cognitive impairment (and all impairment, for that matter).  Notions of value should not be confused with ideas of intrinsic human worth.  Acceptance of the latter does not lead individuals seeking community, based on mutual advantage, to court the participation of a non-contributor.  Only social valuing can uproot the entrenched notion of worthlessness inherent in terms like &quot;useless eaters.&quot; 
      For all people, life as a human being involves living inside a vessel, which is subject to entropy, disease, injury and imperfection.  Historically, society has sequestered those who provide reminders of the frailty of the human body and mind, and in so doing has doggedly clung to a chosen, comfortable illusion.  What has been lost in this collective behavior is the opportunity to lead truly authentic lives, to embrace and incorporate the complete human experience.  People with impairment can lead us in claiming our full humanity and in so doing make an invaluable contribution.

  <dc:title>Social Presence and Therapeutic Demands: The Role of Technology in the Therapeutic Alliance</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This research explores whether access to technology mediated resources that expand social presence opportunities during mental health treatment play a role in what therapists report as difficult therapeutic alliance demands. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious mental health problem, characterized by unstable relationships, anger outbursts and impulsive behaviors. People with BPD tend to be high service users and have difficulty remaining in the treatment setting long enough to benefit from treatment services. Treatment studies have found that the therapeutic alliance is a significant contributing factor to successful outcomes; however, the relational and behavioral difficulties inherent among those diagnosed with BPD can make the development and maintenance of a strong therapeutic relationship difficult. As a result, those with BPD are often stigmatized and denied care. To help ensure appropriate access to care and treatment success for this population, those providing treatment for people with BPD need specific tools and techniques for building and managing the therapeutic relationship. One possibility that is gaining popularity in mental health treatments is the use of information and communication technologies as a part of treatment services. However, little is currently known about how the therapeutic alliance is built and maintained through technology mediated communications. To understand the role technology plays in the therapeutic alliance, specifically when there are high demands on the relationship, this research explored how therapists treating persons diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder might use web-based Internet resources specifically targeted for adjunctive use in therapy. In this study, supportive, Internet based treatment resources for a specific form of evidence based BPD treatment, Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT), were incorporated into a DBT Website and presented in various technology based formats, e.g. video, text, or animations, to intentionally vary and expand the opportunities for social presence between the client and therapist.  A concurrent, mixed methods design was used to deepen understanding of what role social presence and web-based resources play in the therapeutic relationship.  The study used a parallel process in which therapeutic alliance, therapist burnout and client outcomes were measured before and after the implementation of the DBT website, using validated measurement tools.  At the same time, therapist and client reports were gathered through qualitative techniques during and after the experimental period.  Results indicate that when different opportunities for social presence were available, therapists increased their communication with clients and did not rely solely on face to face encounters as the basis for maintaining the therapeutic alliance. Opportunities for social presence were reported as positive influences on the therapeutic alliance in the areas of client learning and provision of therapeutic support. In addition, therapists reported a reduction in burnout by having additional therapeutic support options available. The study also found that variations in social presence had a positive impact on client outcomes, as indicated by decrease in symptoms. In addition, there was also a statistically significant difference in the impulse control scale during the intervention period that was not present in the non-intervention group. Implications from this study indicate that variations in social presence and the range of therapeutic tools available for managing therapeutic relationships may result in an improved therapeutic alliance, improved client outcomes and reduced therapist burnout. The exploratory design of this study had several limitations, primarily related to limited ability to link website use directly to client and therapist outcomes. Despite these limitations, this study begins to create a foundation for use of increased opportunities for social presence as a potential support for the treatment alliance.

  <dc:title>Longitudinal Effects of Improving Inter-Parental Relationships in Low-Income Couples: Child Outcomes</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Poverty and economic hardship create tremendous stress for families, and subsequently are risk factors for child psychopathology.  The Fatherhood, Relationship, and Marriage Education (FRAME) program is a 14-hour psychoeducation intervention developed specifically to strengthen the ability of low-income mothers and fathers to reduce conflict, cope with stress, and co-parent effectively, hopefully helping to create more stable and secure environments for children.  The FRAME study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a couples-based intervention in a sample of 301 ethnically diverse low-income cohabiting mothers and fathers who are parenting at least one child together. Couples were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups or to an assessment-only control condition.  The current research evaluated the impact of the intervention program on a range of parenting behaviors and child outcomes across four time points for both mothers and father, and examined relationships between economic strain and parenting, and parenting and symptoms of psychopathology across four time points.  Hierarchical linear modeling was used for primary analyses. FRAME effectiveness results showed significant time by group interactions for Anxious/ Depressed and Thought Problems symptoms, as well as Parent-Child Positive Interaction, indicating improvements for intervention participants as opposed to controls, as well as a time by group by gender interactions indicating that mothers in the intervention groups reported the steepest decline for Anxious/Depressed symptoms and Internalizing Problems symptoms across all four time points.  Economic strain was significantly related to a number of parenting difficulties, and parenting variables were significantly associated with symptoms of psychopathology for all participants across time. Implications for future studies involving interventions with low-income families are discussed.

  <dc:title>Modeling HRTF For Sound Localization in Normal Listeners and Bilateral Cochlear Implant Users</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems and for testing algorithms through simulation that would be difficult or expensive to implement.  This dissertation presents a model that attempts to simulate the sound localization performance of persons using bilateral cochlear implants.  The expectation is that this model could prove to be a useful tool in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies.
      The head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of this model, and in the ideal case, provides the base characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects.  This defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues that are important to sound localization.  By building on the HRTF, a sound source localization model can be constructed.
      This model was first developed to simulate normal hearing persons and validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization.  The model was then further developed to account for the differences in the signal pathway of the cochlear implant  (CI) user due to sound processing effects, and the microphone location versus pinna and ear canal acoustics.  Finally, the localization error calculated from the model for cochlear implant users was compared to published localization data obtained from these hearing impaired patients in order to validate the modified model.
      Results of the normal hearing model correlated closely with localization performance data published in the literature, with localization error of the model only slightly greater than that of normal hearing subjects.  The cochlear implant population has a more broadly distributed range of localization error than that of the normal hearing population, and in addition, the mean error is significantly poorer.  The performance of the cochlear implant model fell within the range of error reported in the research literature for cochlear implant users.  This close correspondence with the published performance data suggests that the model developed in this dissertation provides a reasonably good approximation of sound source localization for normal hearing subject and persons with bilateral cochlear implants.

  <dc:title>Needs Assessment for Animal-Assisted Interventions: Factors Influencing Implementation of Dogs as Judiciary Aids in Criminal Justice Processes in CPS Cases.</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The study presents findings from a needs assessment exploring the critical features or core elements that bear on professionals regarding the inclusion of dogs as judiciary aides in the investigation and prosecution of child maltreatment cases. Specifically, the objectives of the current needs assessment were examined through the following questions: (1) What are the perceived benefits of implementing programs with dogs as judiciary aids throughout criminal justice? (2) What specific roles do professionals identify for dogs within criminal justice, (3) What are potential barriers to the implementation of dogs as judiciary aids programs, and (4) How are the needs and expectations of agencies considering incorporating dogs similar to or different from those agencies that are currently incorporating dogs.
      The study identified a number of differences in the identified roles, barriers, and important factors reported by survey respondents. Quantitative analysis of responses regarding the role of dogs in the criminal justice setting revealed professionals identified roles for dogs that matched their particular scope of influence. Moreover, qualitative findings provided additional insight into participant&apos;s concerns and convictions and their varying perceptions of factors central to the inclusion of dogs in criminal justice processes for child maltreatment. The study relies heavily on qualitative responses of participants. Implications are discussed with regard to micro and macro levels of social work practice and the field of implementation research.

  <dc:title>Clinicians&apos; Perceptions of the Mental Health of Gay Clients and the Effects of Diversity Competency and Modern Homophobia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Attitudes within the psychological community regarding sexual minorities have evolved over time with a significant history of assigning pathology to lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) clients. Though attitudes have shifted, prejudice has not disappeared. Modern forms of homophobia are less overt and subtler expressions of contempt, disapproval, or discrimination and are rooted in internal conflict. In mental health training programs, LGB clients have historically received little attention, failing to prepare professionals to competently work with this population; encouragingly, this trend is changing. The present study investigated how mental health clinicians assess the level of mental health of gay male clients considering modern homophobia and LGB competency. Specifically, it was hypothesized that less mental health would be assigned to gay clients when compared with heterosexual clients, higher levels of modern homophobia would lead to lower levels of assessed mental health, and LGB competency would moderate both of these associations. Eighty-six mental health trainees and clinicians were randomly assigned a case vignette with either a gay client or a heterosexual client. The vignettes maintained the same symptoms and presenting concerns, yet implied different sexual orientations. Participants completed instruments measuring the mental health of the client, modern homophobia, and diversity competency. Results revealed that the sexual orientation of the client significantly predicted the level of mental health functioning assigned with more health being ascribed to the heterosexual client; however, LGB competency did not moderate this relationship. Modern homophobia did not significantly predict the extent of mental health assigned nor was it moderated by LGB competency. Post-hoc analyses suggested that there might be a difference in the assessment of mental health versus assessment of pathology, with the latter being significantly related to modern homophobia. Implications of the study for practice and training are discussed.

  <dc:title>RADAR Based Collision Avoidance for Unmanned Aircraft Systems</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have become increasingly prevalent and will
      represent an increasing percentage of all aviation. These unmanned aircraft are
      available in a wide range of sizes and capabilities and can be used for a multitude of
      civilian and military applications. However, as the number of UAS increases so does
      the risk of mid-air collisions involving unmanned aircraft. This dissertation aims to
      present one possible solution for addressing the mid-air collision problem in addition
      to increasing the levels of autonomy of UAS beyond waypoint navigation to include
      preemptive sensor-based collision avoidance. The presented research goes beyond the
      current state of the art by demonstrating the feasibility and providing an example of a
      scalable, self-contained, RADAR-based, collision avoidance system. The technology
      described herein can be made suitable for use on a miniature (Maximum Takeoff
      Weight &lt; 10kg) UAS platform. This is of paramount importance as the miniature
      UAS field has the lowest barriers to entry (acquisition and operating costs) and
      consequently represents the most rapidly increasing class of UAS.

  <dc:title>Social Media and Relationship Development</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The present study examined the use of social media to represent romantic relationships among a diverse, national sample (N=831) of Facebook users aged 20-37. Taken together, results from this study indicate that relationship representation via Facebook is associated with various aspects of commitment, including couple identity, prioritization of one&apos;s relationship, and commitment to the future, and was also associated with stability of the relationship over time. Social media relationship representation was also found to be associated with lower levels of sexual infidelity, alternative partner monitoring, and partner&apos;s jealousy, as well as higher levels of perceived social pressure from friends and family for one&apos;s relationship to continue. No gender differences in relationship representation via social media were found among individuals who were currently in relationships, but single men were found to be more likely than single women to display their single status via Facebook. Among single individuals, displaying one&apos;s single status via Facebook was associated with sexual activity with a higher number of sexual partners. These results are consistent with hypotheses based on commitment theory, self-presentation theory, and economic signal theory. Results are discussed in light of commitment theory, and the fact that many social scientists have perceived a recent societal trend toward ambiguity in relationship development processes among emerging adults. The findings lend support to the notion that social media provides individuals and society with the opportunity to adopt clear, public emblems of commitment, thought by many social scientists to be on the decline. The importance of the volitional nature of social media relationship representation is considered, as are the clinical, methodological, and societal implications of the present results. Limitations of this study and the challenges and possibilities of social media in the field of relationship research are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.

  <dc:title>Sound Reason: Radiolab and the Micropolitics of Podcasting</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Over the past 10 years, the practice of podcasting has migrated from the margins of technological conferences to a central role in popular culture. Podcasting is an Internet-based broadcast medium that relies on Real Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds--a peer subscription service--to automatically retrieve and upload content to a portable MP3 player. In light of its growth and popularity, I ask, &quot;what is the podcast&apos;s political potential?&quot; In this project, I argue that the podcast has the potential to serve as an instrument of liberal and neurological reasoning. My project will pursue this line of inquiry by asking three research questions: first, what is the cultural history of the podcast? Second, what are podcasts&apos; political potential? And finally, what are the ethics of critical podcast argumentation? To answer these questions, I will attend to the popular and critically acclaimed podcast, Radiolab. 
      In contrast to technological histories that revolve around the figure of the inventor, I will write a history of the &quot;podcast present.&quot; This method requires attention to the localized moments that become inscribed into podcasting and dictate its use. First, I explore the Duke iPod experiment, which is largely viewed as a watershed moment for podcast pedagogy, enabling podcasting to become educational. Second, I locate the podcast within a historical conjuncture. Additionally, this section theorizes Radiolab acts as a &quot;listening technology&quot; that entrains neurological and liberal sensibilities. Finally, I attend to Radiolab&apos;s &quot;yellow rain&quot; controversy, which problematizes neurological and liberal dispositions by demonstrating how they can court epistemological injustice. On the theoretical level, this project registers the recursive relationship between new media and argumentation to clear a space for new tactics to engage this shifting political terrain. I extend argumentation scholarship by updating traditional argumentative concepts and by inventing new heuristics to accommodate emerging digital practices. This dissertation also intervenes in digital media studies by exploring how political projects and programs recruit new media. On a practical level, this project advocates that podcasts are beneficial instruments that provide citizens with new procedures to adjust their habits and dispositions.

  <dc:title>Acculturation, Marianismo Gender Role, and Ambivalent Sexism in Predicting Depression in Latinas</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study explores acculturation, the Latina gender role of marianismo, and ambivalent sexism in predicting depression in a community sample of Latinas. A review of existing literature regarding these variables reveals that all three constructs can be both risk factors as well as protective factors. Since marianismo and ambivalent sexism may share similar traits, both may be self-protective coping mechanisms by Latinas in the context of a patriarchal environment with structured gender roles and strong gender disparities. One hundred and thirteen adult Latina participants from various ancestries of origin were solicited from the community using an Internet survey tool. Acculturation in this study was measured by the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS); marianismo by the Latina Values Scale-Revised (LVS-R); and ambivalent sexism by the Ambivalent Sexism Scale (ASI). The outcome variable, depression, was measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results showed that Latinas who endorsed higher hostile sexism tended to endorse higher benevolent sexism. Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo tended to endorse higher benevolent sexism. Further, Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo also tended to endorse higher overall ambivalent sexism (the sum of hostile and benevolent sexism). Finally, Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo tended to endorse higher satisfaction, or lower perception of conflicts, with their marianista traits. The correlation between acculturation and marianismo, acculturation and hostile sexism, acculturation and benevolent sexism, as well as marianismo and hostile sexism were all non-significant. Linear regression was conducted to examine whether acculturation, marianismo, hostile sexism and benevolent sexism predicted depression in Latinas. Results indicated a significant model - in particular, marianismo was a significant predictor of depression in Latinas. The other predictors failed to predict depression in Latinas. After controlling for demographic variables, the incremental regression model was non-significant. Despite the model&apos;s overall non-significance, the predictor of age was found to be significant, that is, as age increased, depression tended to decrease. Finally, benevolent sexism was also found to be significant in the incremental regression model, that is, as benevolent sexism increased, depression tended to increase. Marianismo and the other predictors were not found to be significant in the final model. The limitations of the study were discussed, including a small sample size, higher socioeconomic status, as well as the use of an online data collection method. Clinical implications of the study included adding to the knowledge of multicultural competency in the field of psychology, specifically the importance of considering the impact of bicultural acculturation, gender role, clients&apos; perceived satisfaction with their gender role, as well as clients&apos; sexist experiences.

  <dc:title>Spectacle, Sacrifice and the State: The Legacy of European Fascism and the Revival of Martyrdom in the Modern World</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The rise of political martyrdom in the contemporary world is not a new phenomenon but can be traced back to at least the early Twentieth Century with the rise of European Fascist movements. Both they, and the fascist-like movements of today, share a cluster of characteristics that allow for fruitful comparisons of the ways in which martyrdom spectacles are used to communicate with constituent populations, facilitate a culture of violence, perpetuate their revolutionary zeal and demonstrate the characteristics of the ideal citizen. Examining four major movements; Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, the Palestinian Hamas and the modern Iran, this dissertation argues that 1) the use of martyrdom by today&apos;s fascist-like fundamentalists is not unique, but follows a well-known path taken by the earlier fascist movements of the twentieth century; 2) martyrdom spectacles can be used to build support within the population and present a narrative of the ideal citizen; 3) there are different uses of martyrdom spectacles between the regime phase and the movement phase for both fascist and fascist-like movements. By exploring the relationship between martyrdom spectacles and their disciplining nature, we can better understand the logic of contemporary fundamentalist movements and the techniques they used to achieve power and maintain control.

  <dc:title>Depression and Suicide Behavior among College Students: Understanding the Moderator Effects of Self-Esteem and Suicide Resilience</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      As suicide-related incidents on college campuses increase and receive intense media coverage and a growing percentage of college students experience suicide ideation and attempts, there is a desperate need for a more profound understanding of suicidality and its risk and protective factors among college populations. Recent years there has been a growing interest in the buffering effect of resilience on suicidality (Johnson, Wood, Gooding, Taylor, &amp; Tarrier, 2011). This study adds to the suicide literature by exploring the relationship among depression, self-esteem, suicide resilience, and suicidality. Undergraduate students from a large university in the Western United States were asked to assess their depressive symptoms, level of self-esteem, level of suicide resilience, and thoughts and behaviors of suicide. Multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between these variables. The results indicate that depression was a statistically significant predictor of suicide behavior. Results also suggest that high self-esteem and high suicide resilience were buffers that protect college students who experience depression from developing suicide behavior. A three-way interaction of depression, self-esteem, and suicide resilience in predicting suicide behavior was also found to be statistically significant. It suggests that when self-esteem and suicide resilience were both high, the association between depression and suicide behavior was the weakest; when self-esteem and suicide resilience were both low, the association was the strongest. Additional clinical implications, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are addressed.

  <dc:title>Vegetation Response After Invasive Tamarix Spp. Removal in the Riparian Zone and Semi-arid Rangeland Ecosystems</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      ABSTRACT
      	Removal of Tamarix spp. (a.k.a. tamarisk, saltcedar, Athel) invasion is often involved in restoration of Western, riparian habitat; however monitoring of vegetation after removal is often neglected and thus opportunity for adaptive management lost. To address this need, I have conducted three and half years of monitoring vegetation response after invasive Tamarix removal in twenty-five sites on the East and Western Colorado, starting fall 2009. I am also comparing six different methodologies: Point intercept, line transect, nearest neighbor, meter-square quadrats, nested Whittaker plots, and densitometer with the objective of developing monitoring protocols that can be used by scientists and land managers alike. This project is in collaboration with Branson Trinchera Conservation District (BTCD), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). 
      	My intent is that this monitoring project will help to answer the controversial questions about the ecological impact of Tamarix removal, including testing the prediction that removal of Tamarix will increase native cover, and that an increase in the cover and diversity of desirable species will also prevent secondary invasion of introduced and noxious species. Overall, the project will help to better understand the ecological impact of the invasive species on the invaded native habitat and whether or not restoration efforts are valuable.

  <dc:title>A Theological Inquiry Regarding The Practice Of The Eucharist In Cyberspace</dc:title>
  <dc:description>This study looks at the Eucharist in cyberspace, beginning with a case study of a faith community who met with controversy after the group shared the ritual in cyberspace. Based on a qualitative study of the practice and its aftermath, the theoretical analysis includes the nature of the Internet itself and its capacity as a location for
networked communities; its capacity to operate as a communication medium for a religious ritual; and the involvement of active users. The users in this case were members of a religious community interested in preserving their Eucharist theological tradition. The first set of major issues revolves around the process of negotiating the manner in which the practice and the use of technology can be reconfigured to accommodate the innovation. Such reconfiguring involves a level of interaction in which the criteria of a networked community for
Eucharist can be said to exist. Negotiating a use of the Internet should give attention to aesthetic elements that makes for a robust engagement using the medium. The next set of major issues involve evaluating whether or not a Wesleyan/holiness theology of Eucharist, nuanced by a Calvinistic view of Christ’s presence, would be fitting to an online venue. I explored a creative redeployment of these theological traditions in terms of Eucharist in cyberspace being a networked communication of grace characterized by the agency of the user, who joins other participants in a sacramental encounter with Christ. I analyzed what each piece looked like theologically in tandem with a cultural perspective of the Internet and religious practice in cyberspace. I concluded that there was theological warrant for adapting the Eucharist to cyberspace for a legitimate practice that could fulfill the religious and theological purposes sought by a networked community.

  <dc:title>&quot;Wee Women&apos;s Work:&quot; Women and Peacebuilding in Northern Ireland</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      International norms on intrastate conflicts, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, call for women to participate in peace processes in countries emerging from conflict and civil strife, including those divided by identity-based conflict.  However, scholars of post-war recovery in international relations and comparative politics have raised questions about the extent and effect of women&apos;s participation in peace processes, and in politics more generally, in divided societies given underlying social, economic, and political barriers that impeded access to decisive or authoritative political decision-making.  A critical question in the literature on women&apos;s participation in post-conflict reconciliation-related dialogue and joint action relates to whether intra-group &quot;community development&quot; focusing principally on social and economic concerns can contribute to fostering women&apos;s participation in intergroup reconciliation and peacebuilding.  This study explores the experiences of community development in Northern Ireland with the research question: How and under what conditions do women contribute to peacebuilding? The research represents formal interviews with experts in the community and voluntary sector and the women&apos;s sector, informal focus groups, and six months of ethnographic field research based primarily in Belfast. Northern Ireland is a case of protracted social conflict in which the society is still deeply divided, despite successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Women played a significant role in the peace process by forming their own political party--the Northern Ireland Women&apos;s Coalition--and yet are poorly represented in political institutions today. Instead, women dominate the field of community development contributing to peace through capacity-building and other bottom-up practices. Women pursue community development in this case for two broad reasons: first, because it is not political in the formal institutional sense; second, in an environment where women are expected to play traditional roles, community development is interpreted as an extension of these roles allowing women to navigate through the constraints of a gendered public space and employ their roles as women to seek change that does not threaten the political status quo.

  <dc:title>Emotion Processes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescent Depression</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for adolescent depression, recent findings indicate that positive treatment effects are reduced among youth with a history of childhood interpersonal trauma (CIT). The processing of emotionally-difficult content has been previously emphasized in therapeutic models for the treatment of depression, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The present study evaluated the impact of emotion processes on treatment outcomes in two forms of psychotherapy (CBT and usual care treatment) for adolescent depression. This study observationally coded client emotional involvement, specifically during discussions of trauma-related content, as a potentially critical mechanism of change in proximal (emotion dysregulation) and distal (depressive symptom) treatment outcomes. Findings showed that client emotional involvement can be reliably evaluated, and further parsed into two separate constructs. Overall, results demonstrated limited evidence to support the link between client emotional involvement and treatment outcomes, as no statistically significant associations were found. Methodological and clinical implications are discussed.

  <dc:title>The Journey to Teaching Online: A Case Study of Faculty Preparation And Experiences in Online Teaching</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      When Bill Gates published his book &quot;The Road Ahead&quot; (1995), he summarized the transformative implications of the personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global information super highway.  Almost twenty years later, the tsunami of online programs and the MOOCs (massive online open courses) is impacting the structural integrity of postsecondary institutions and changing the competitive landscape of higher learning at an unprecedented pace.  When Allen and Seaman (2013) asked the question of whether faculty acceptance of online education increased in their Sloan Consortium annual report, only 30.2% of chief academic officers believe their faculty accept the value and legitimacy of online education.  This rate is even lower than the rate recorded in 2004.  With an apparent widening gap between institutional strategy and faculty acceptance, each organization needs to conceptually map its road ahead.  However, only an institution as a whole can decide for itself what kind of change is needed and define what constitutes evidence of lasting change.  This implies a unique transformation of institutional philosophy, culture, strategy, and reward systems for faculty members.  
      Complex adoptive system (CAS) theory (Olson &amp; Eoyang, 2001), suggests that the most powerful organizational transformations occur not at the macro level but rather at the micro level where behaviors and changes began to emerge.  Thus, instead of trying to measure, evaluate, or categorize which faculty member fits into which stage of online faculty development under which framework, this study asked four tenured faculty members to reconstruct their experiences on why they teach online, how they learn to teach online, and what factors influences their journeys to teaching online.  Their narratives painted a landscape of faculty acceptance in institutions and the online learning phenomena in our society.  Ultimately, their stories are really about change.  By studying the &quot;change agents&quot; in a changing organization in a changing industry, this study is not an exercise to identify the best practices.  Rather, this study hopes to inspire new ideas for new ways to conceptually frame the problem facing the faculty, the institution, and the industry in their road ahead in teaching online.  
      The researcher hopes that this study may be used by institution leaders, faculty developers, and other faculty members to: (1) assess the level of progress of their current and future distance learning program, (2) determine how distance learning programs should be established, (3) evaluate faculty development efforts, (4) improve strategies and implementations for institutionalization of their distance education programs, including academic programming and faculty reward structure, and (5) improve online student retention and learning outcomes.

  <dc:title>Thermal and Electrical Transport in Ferromagnetic Metal Thin Films</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The recent emergence of spin caloritronics has focused considerable attention on the interplay between spin, charge, and temperature gradients in magnetic materials.  A reliable and energy efficient method for generating pure spin currents would signify an important step toward future spin-based nano-electronics that may offer lower power consumption and greater processing capabilities.  To develop new technology using thermoelectric effects in magnetic thin films, it is essential to understand thermal and electrical transport through these films. One possible source of pure spin currents is the so-called spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in which a thermal gradient applied to a ferromagnet is thought to produce a pure spin current detectable by measuring a transverse voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) generated by the inverse spin Hall effect.  However, recent work on spin-dependent transport in thin film nanostructures supported by bulk substrates has underscored the difficulty in understanding thermal gradients in these systems due to uncertainty in the direction of the applied thermal gradient through a substrate with a thermal conductance several orders of magnitude larger than the sample conductance.  These results suggest that early SSE experiments may have been strongly affected by other effects such as the anomalous Nernst effect.  They may also have been affected by thermoelectric effects generated from planar thermal gradients such as the planar Nernst effect which develops a V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; in a film with a planar thermal gradient and magnetization.  
      In this dissertation, I introduce the concepts of thermal conductivity, the Wiedemann-Franz law, and thermoelectric effects including the Seebeck effect, the Peltier effect, and the planar Nernst effect (PNE).  Next, I describe our experimental method for measuring thermal and electrical transport in non magnetic and ferromagnetic metallic thin films using suspended Si-N membrane structures.  Our membrane method reduces the background thermal conductance contribution by 5 orders of magnitude when compared with similar experiments conducted on thin films supported by bulk substrates.  This confinement to the plane of the platform and film ensures a thermal gradient in the x- or y-direction only.  The experiment therefore enables exploration of thermoelectric effects in a  completely 2-D configuration.  Next, I present results of several experiments probing thermal conductivity and the Lorenz number in thin films.  Both the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity of metallic thin films is lower that bulk values from literature.  The deviation of the Lorenz number from the theoretically predicted Sommerfeld value in all films indicates imbalances between the heat and charge currents in the films from scattering or additional thermal conductivity contributions from magnons and phonons.   I also present results from experiments measuring the Seebeck effect or thermopower, and anisotropic magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic thin films.  In these films, the thermopower scales with resistance as predicted by the Mott equation, and the magnetic field dependence of the thermopower results from the same spin-dependent scattering responsible for the AMR.  I present the first results from experiments designed to probe the PNE and related effects such as the SSE in ferromagnetic thin films.   The results share features previously attributed to the SSE such as linear delta T dependence and sign reversal on hot and cold sides of the sample, however, the voltage generated transverse to the applied thermal gradient is always even in applied field due to spin-dependent scattering.  The data display a sin&amp;theta;cos&amp;theta; angular dependence predicted by the PNE rather than the cos&amp;theta; angular dependence expected from the SSE.  In these experiments, we observe no evidence of a thermally generated spin current, and the upper limit on the SSE coefficient in our experiment is 15-30 times smaller than previously reported by experiments conducted using bulk substrates.  Finally, I present first results from experiments designed to measure the Peltier effect in thin films and test the interdependence between the Peltier and Seebeck effects predicted by Onsager reciprocal relations.  These are the first measurements of the Peltier effect and Onsager reciprocity in ferromagnetic thin films near room temperature, and are an important step to confirm the validity of the theoretically predicted Onsager reciprocity in these systems.

  <dc:title>Human Action Recognition Via Fused Kinematic Structure and Surface Representation</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Human action recognition from visual data has remained a challenging problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. This dissertation introduces a new methodology for human action recognition using motion features extracted from kinematic structure, and shape features extracted from surface representation of human
      body. Motion features are used to provide sufficient information about human movement, whereas shape features are used to describe the structure of silhouette. These features are fused at the kernel level  using Multikernel Learning (MKL) technique to enhance the overall performance of human action recognition. In fact, there are advantages in using multiple types of features for human action recognition,  especially, if the features are complementary to each other (e.g. kinematic/motion features and shape features). For instance, challenging problems such as inter-class similarity among actions and performance variation, which cannot be resolved easily by using a single type of feature, can be handled by fusing multiple types of features.
      This dissertation presents a new method for representing the human body surface provided by depth map (3-D) using spherical harmonics representation. The advantage of using the spherical harmonics representation is to represent the whole body surface into a nite series of spherical harmonics coefficients. Furthermore, these series can be used to describe the pose of the body using the phase information encoded inside the coefficients. Another method for detecting/tracking distal limb segments using the kinematic structure is developed. The advantage of using the distal limb segments is to extract discriminative features that can provide sufficient  and compact information to recognize human actions. Our experimental results show that the aforementioned methods for human action description are complementary to each other. Hence, combining both features can enhance the robustness of action recognition. In this context, a framework to fuse multiple features using MKL technique is developed. The experimental results show that this framework is promising in incorporating multiple features in different domain for automated recognition of human actions

  <dc:title>Navigating the Paradox: An Examination of Compliance-gaining and Relational Development in Hostage Incidents</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study sought to examine potential relationships between compliance-gaining strategy use and the outcome of hostage negotiation events. Persuasion has been identified as being a critical yet understudied part of the negotiation process. Utilizing the theory of Speech Acts, this study argued that compliance-gaining strategies play an essential role in the hostage recovery process. Specifically, compliance-gaining strategies allow the negotiator to exercise persuasion during the negotiation process while also building an interaction context that allows the hostage taker to feel as if the negotiator is working with, rather than against, the perpetrator. This type of relationship allows the negotiator to exert a greater degree of influence in the incident. Through analyzing nine hostage incidents, this study was able to identify compliance-gaining tactics that related to the outcome of hostage events. Compliance-gaining tactics that reduce relational distance were related to peaceful outcomes and compliance-gaining tactics that increased relational distance were related to unsuccessful outcomes. This study also found that the use of compliance-gaining tactics was particularly important in the final Resolution stage of hostage incidents. In examining the ways that the parties respond to the use of compliance-gaining techniques, the hostage takers&apos; use of Agreement or Disagreement were discovered to be related to incident outcome. Practical applications for negotiation professionals, disciplinary contributions, and study limitations were also discussed.

  <dc:title>Thinking, with Heidegger, the Religion-Science-Theology Relation</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This work is an attempt to think the essential nature of the interrelationships among religion, science, and theology (RST) out of Heidegger&apos;s engagement with the question of Being. Three primary questions initially motivated this inquiry: First, how are the interrelations (if any) among religion, science, and theology to be understood? Second, is a relation of &quot;dialogue,&quot; in some sense, possible among the three elements of the RST triad? And third, does theology have a rightful place in the public square dominated by the view that science serves as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for rationality and truth? The inquiry interweaves five threads, or lines of inquiry, which are posited as pertinent in the current RST discourse and central to Heidegger&apos;s thought. The first thread consists of the chapter themes: phenomenology, truth, technology, and ethics. The other four threads--comportment toward things, reflection, thinking, and destiny--each &quot;cross-cut,&quot; or traverse, the chapter themes.
      By Heidegger&apos;s lights, each cross-cutting thread harbors a duality: comportment toward things as objectification or non-objectification; reflection as &lt;italic&gt;Reflexion&lt;italic&gt; or &lt;italic&gt;Besinnung&lt;italic&gt; (mindfulness); thinking as calculative or meditative; and destiny as fate or the sending of Being (&lt;italic&gt;Geschick&lt;italic&gt;). Heidegger&apos;s critique of each duality--and the expanded global context suggested here for thinking the RST relation--offer fresh opportunities for reinscribing the customary formulation of theology (i.e., reflection upon religious experience and belief) as a basis for a compelling dialogue among religion, science, and theology today.

  <dc:title>Individual and Family Factors Related to the Reduction of Risk Behavior in Asian Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation study examined the risk and promotive factors that can hinder or help adolescents as they transition into adulthood. Chinese, Japanese and Korean adolescents were surveyed in order to examine the individual and family factors influencing risk behavior in adolescents. Correlation and regression were used to examine the relationship among variables. Findings from the analysis revealed that promotive factors including: autonomy, easy temperament, emotional intelligence, humor, moral development, optimism and physical beauty, and risk factors including: history of physical abuse, history of sexual abuse, domestic violence, favoritism of siblings, parental depression and parent not aware, were found to be predicative in North America, Europe, and Australia are also predictive for East Asian cultures. Implications of these findings for theory, research, policy and social work practice are explored.

  <dc:title>Computational Biomechanical Modeling of the Human Knee During Kneeling</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Total knee replacement benefits patients who suffer from severe knee pain or joint stiffness and other joint related illnesses that limit everyday activities. There has been an increase in the number of procedures performed each year and a need to evaluate the performance of these implants during specialized activities such as kneeling. Most computational studies lack insight into inter-patient variability and the results do not apply to large population. This study developed: (1) three-dimensional explicit finite element (FE) models to investigate natural and implanted knee joint kinematics and bone strain and (2) a platform to enable population-based evaluation by combining statistical model and joint function. Verification of a finite element model confirmed a strong agreement between model predicted and in-vitro kinematics of specimen-specific patellofemoral (PF) joints of four cadaveric knees in simulated kneeling. Three different commonly used PF implants were employed in an additional broader patellar bone strain study to assess the relative performance of these implants during highly demanding activities. This study predicted that the medialized dome design achieves the optimal balance of sufficient congruency between PF articular surfaces while still facilitating sagittal plane tilt to reduce isolated loading of the distal nose of the patella. A combined statistical shape model and FE method were utilized to successfully identify the most important shape characteristics affecting joint performance during kneeling. Scaling in the knee joint has minimal effect on PF joint kinematics but greatly affects joint contact mechanics. Knee soft tissue dimensions alter the kinematics. The patellar bone strain model described here provides a novel platform for further implant performance analyses. The statistical shape-function model is a tool for population based studies to help predict the clinical outcome of joint replacement.

  <dc:title>Therapists&apos; Attitudes Toward Forgiveness: The Influence of Four Conceptualizations on Predicted Likelihood to Assist Clients to Forgive During Treatment</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Research supports the use of forgiveness in psychotherapy; however, little is known about how this process is integrated into treatment. Views on the utility of forgiveness appear to be mixed. Differences in conceptualization appear to exist between interventionists who promote its use and those who argue against it. This study explored the potential relationship between therapists&apos; conceptualization of forgiveness, categorized as either agreeing with popular interventionists or not, and their predicted assistance of client forgiveness, as well as relationships between attitudes toward forgiveness and other potentially related variables Two hundred sixty nine participants recruited from practice-focused graduate training institutions completed a web-based survey. Results indicated there was no significant relationship between therapist conceptualizations and their belief that they will help clients forgive. More positive attitudes toward forgiveness and greater religious commitment were significant predictors of likelihood to assist clients forgive. Attitudes were significantly predicted by religious commitment and dispositional forgiveness, when controlling for likelihood to help clients forgive. Limitations, future directions, and results are discussed in the context of multicultural training, values, and therapeutic decision-making.

  <dc:title>Applying a Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding and Evaluating the Effects of Family Treatment among Sexually Abusive Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Families are frequently identified as a risk for supporting and perpetuating sexually abusive behavior among youth. Traditionally, the field has focused on deficits of families rather than considering them as a resource to promote change. Although emerging literature strongly argues the need to target families in the healing process, treatment initiatives rarely follow suite, and research has failed to comprehensively document the effectiveness of family-inclusive treatment. Knowing there are several gaps in literature, the current study was conducted to investigate the process of engagement in treatment, understand the nuances of family treatment, and to uncover positive outcomes associated with family involvement. An embedded mixed methods design was carried out in collaboration with the Colorado Sex Offender Management Board. Quantitative data were collected from probation files of adjudicated youth (N = 85) in three different Colorado jurisdictions, and qualitative data were collected from approved Colorado treatment providers (N = 19). Rigorous data analyses techniques were employed, including a qualitative Grounded Theory approach using structural, values, and focused coding schemas to analyze qualitative data and logistic regression models to analyze quantitative data. Qualitative results reveled the high level of stress among families and underscored the therapeutic relationship and treatment components as reciprocal provisions of treatment, whereby one is contingent upon the other for ethical service delivery. Quantitative logistic regression models demonstrated that youth with greater family service involvement (measured on a continuous scale composed of constructs of family therapy, multi-family group, family multi-disciplinary team, informed supervision, and family reunification) were three times more likely to successfully complete treatment than those who did not receive any family services. A conceptual model emerged that revealed strategies to move families through the treatment process. Inherent implications suggest that: crisis prevention initiatives are important to avert high levels of family stress; current treatment frameworks should be revised to include family protective factors; critical mechanisms of change should be tested quantitatively; and family services should occur uniformly. Overall, future research steps should detail a manual for how to pragmatically move families through the treatment process, test the effectiveness of that manual, and then disseminate effective methods to the provider community.

  <dc:title>Editorial Collaboration and Control: Laura Riding and the Seizen Press Years</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      With the founding of Seizin Press in 1927, Laura Riding began a new epoch in her career as poet and literary theorist.  Along with her partner, Robert Graves, Riding worked among and with important literary tastemakers of the Modernist era, such as Gertrude Stein, Len Lye and James Reeves.  Riding&apos;s demanding and intense editorial and collaborative style resulted in some unique and fascinating works, such as the bizarrely beautiful &lt;italic&gt;Life of the Dead&lt;/italic&gt; and the egomaniacal &lt;italic&gt;The World and Ourselves&lt;/italic&gt;. Beyond close literary examination of the above works, this study looks at the pressures both within the Seizin Press community and without--such as the demands of new publishing standards on small presses, and the intrusion of the Spanish Civil War. Ultimately, the control Riding exerted on both her own work and the works of those around her reflected more than the hysterical micro-managing of which she and so many other women editors were accused.  Instead, her obsessive desire to control every word written by her collaborators and clients spoke to her radical view of language as not only stable, but the only link with ultimate truth.  Authors, especially poets, became more and more suspect as purveyors of lies in Riding&apos;s point of view.  During her years at the press, Riding&apos;s understanding of the poet&apos;s role in society shifted from one akin to priest into one akin to charlatan.  For Riding scholars, it is especially important that we consider the impact of Riding&apos;s years at Seizin Press in her infamous disavowal of poetry in 1941.  This study therefore works to place in conversation Riding&apos;s years at Seizin with her language theories and, in turn, explore the way such theories defined Riding&apos;s reality through her work at the press.

  <dc:title>Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment: Does Family Systems Therapy Improve Family Functioning and Decrease Drug Use?</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Family systems therapy is a way of working with individuals, couples, families, or a group of people that emphasizes relationships and a person&apos;s/family&apos;s greater &quot;system&quot; as important factors in establishing change and health (Haley, 1976; Minuchin, 1974).  Treating adolescent substance abuse with family systems therapy has been demonstrated in the literature as being an effective method of intervention (Coatsworth, Santisteban, McBride, &amp; Szapocznik, 2001; Kumfer &amp; Alvarado, 2003; Leichtling, Gabriel, Lewis &amp; Vander Ley, 2006; Liddle, 2002; Liddle et al., 2001; Rowe &amp; Liddle, 2003), as the various ecological and epidemiological factors associated with adolescent substance abuse can be addressed effectively with family systems work (Cunningham &amp; Henggler, 1999; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 1979; Liddle et al., 2001; Szapocznik &amp; Williams, 2000).  The dissertation used a sample of 71 families who participated in a family systems therapy intensive outpatient substance abuse program in the greater metro-Denver area from 2006 to mid-2008.  The youth, aged 13-17 years old, tended to be highly involved with substance abuse, were not motivated to change, and were not interested in participating in treatment.  A three-month follow-up survey was evaluated and demonstrated that both youth and parents/guardians found that that family systems therapy was effective in increasing the family&apos;s functioning, decreasing the youth&apos;s substance use, increasing the youth&apos;s school performance, and decreasing the youth&apos;s court involvement.

  <dc:title>Mimicry, Mirroring, Subversion, and Critique: Reading Heterotopia in the Cubicula of the Sacraments</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation examines the spaces commonly called the Cubicula of the Sacraments, five rooms in the Callistus Catacomb in Rome, in light of Michel Foucault&apos;s concept of heterotopia. I argue that the Christian communities that created the Cubicula constructed their spaces and construed the symbolic worlds they conjured there as a way of mimicking, mirroring, subverting, and critiquing the &quot;other&quot; spaces and cultures that surrounded them. 
      This work takes place along four lines of inquiry. The first of these is space and place, and uses Foucault&apos;s and Henri Lefebvre&apos;s notions of heterotopia to describe the Callistus Catacomb&apos;s location in the Roman landscape--its relationship to other spaces, structures, and ideas. The second is art; the rich decorations in the Cubicula provide opportunity to think about the communities&apos; creative use of new and traditional iconography to construct a uniquely Christian world-view in art. The third is texts. Much of the art in the Cubicula is drawn from or connected to textual sources, and examination of those texts reveals selections and interpretations that tend toward spatial readings and meanings. The fourth is practices; the Cubicula of the Sacraments contain references to practices such as baptism and meals, and served as locations for practices such as funerals and pilgrimage--all serving to underscore and enhance the heterotopian nature of the spaces. 
      Together, the evidence of space and place, art, texts, and practices, when viewed through Foucault&apos;s work, reveal that the Cubicula of the Sacraments were heterotopias, or &quot;other spaces,&quot; within the Roman landscape. These were spaces of contestation, expression, and the formation of communal identity--venues for the construal of Christianity and its place in the world, and meticulously constructed microcosms of the world as they thought it ought to be. 
      This dissertation, then, provides a holistic, theoretically grounded view of catacomb spaces, and demonstrates the usefulness of approaches that combine various types of evidence available in the catacombs to &quot;read&quot; them as wholes. It also illuminates Christian construals of themselves and the Roman Empire in the period before Constantine, shedding light on the development of Christian traditions.

  <dc:title>A Mixed Methods Examination of Structural Bigenderism and the Consequences for Transgender and Gender Variant People</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For years, transgender activists and their allies have spoken out about the oppression that transgender and gender non-conforming people experience in relation to societal systems and institutions, due to policies and practices that do not acknowledge non-binary experiences of gender, that do not recognize that one&apos;s gender may change over time or may not match cultural expectations for gender expression, and that punish and discriminate against trans people (Gilbert, 2009; Lombardi &amp; Davis, 2006; Markman, 2011; Spade, 2006; WWRC, 2010). Scholars have called for human services professionals and researchers to critique the failures of institutions in society (and the people within them) that continue to reproduce oppressive patterns related to gender (Davis, 2008; Markman, 2011; Spade, 2006; Wilchins, 2004). This dissertation examines the topic of structural bigenderism, using a mixed methods analysis of data based on the lives of transgender and gender non-conforming people in two settings of interest to social workers--social welfare settings and higher education.
      This study analyzes secondary data from two community-based projects: a qualitative participatory research project in Colorado of 30 transgender people&apos;s experiences in higher education, and a national survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force of transgender people&apos;s experiences of discrimination across a variety of settings (Grant et al., 2011). Qualitative themes provide detail about problematic institutional practices, interactions with people who embody the power of the institution, and suggestions for improving higher education settings. Quantitative findings (with sample sizes ranging from &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 296 to &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 3,480, depending on the model) indicate a general pattern that transgender people who held multiple marginalized identities were at greatest risk of unequal treatment in social welfare settings, being denied access to or thrown out of homeless shelters, being denied financial aid or scholarships, being denied access to gender-appropriate spaces at school, and being prohibited from changing their student records to reflect their gender. Joint data displays explore the role of intersectionality in transgender people&apos;s experiences in higher education. The study concludes with a discussion of implications for social work practitioners and educators.

  <dc:title>Hope&apos;s Voice: Listening to Urban Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For several decades, there has been a large gap between the achievement scores of urban youth of color and their white counterparts. This achievement gap persists despite the efforts of educators and policymakers to close it. This descriptive study examined the perceptions of urban youth of color regarding their role in school and the support and barriers they encountered related to academic achievement in school. 
      Duncan-Andrade (2009) compares schooling in underserved communities to growing roses in concrete. He argues that the conditions of life for urban youth of color are in themselves oppositional forces. He writes that hope is required urban youth face such forces. Hope is composed of three parts: goals, pathways, and agency (McDermott, 2002; Snyder, 2003).  
      This study examined the goals, pathways, and agency for urban youth of color and their perception of what schools are doing to support them.  Through the use of focus groups and surveys in two high schools in the Denver metropolitan region of Colorado, students&apos; stories were collected. These groups were facilitated by student leaders from Urban Youth Ambassadors. 
      Major findings in this study include that students identified a greater number of barriers to engagement than they identified sources of support. All three sources of support (teacher/student relationships, family influence, and teacher quality) were also potential barriers to engagement according to the students. School climate and limiting mental models were the other two barriers to engagement. The teacher was central in two of the support and barrier themes: Teacher/Student Relationship Quality (TSRQ) and Teaching Quality (TQ).The teacher&apos;s ability to develop a strong, productive relationship with the students can be the factor that changes a student&apos;s experience and success. The students articulated hope through relationships and displayed evidence of personal resilience toward accomplishing goals. The goal orientation that emerged in this study was more about relationships and the people in student&apos;s lives than it was about academic achievement or the standardized testing.

  <dc:title>Assessment of the Performance of a Resilient Hybrid Political System: The Case of Malaysia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Countries that come out of the &quot;gray zone&quot; during &quot;third wave democratization,&quot;  as ambiguous as they may seem politically, may not be a manifestation of a failed democratization attempt. Rather, their &quot;hybrid&quot; characteristics, portraying neither a full democracy nor outright authoritarian practices entrenched in the system, may plausibly serve as a panacea to governing, especially in a troubled state.
      Many studies that have depicted the &quot;hybrid&quot; political system have focused more on its conceptualization and typology rather than how this kind of regime actually performs and functions. However, studying this regime type only at its surface does not help us to understand the in-depth nature of a hybrid regime nor its political setup. A thorough assessment is needed for this purpose. Therefore, this case study evaluates the performance of the hybrid political system that is practiced in Malaysia.
      This study assesses the two democratic principles of popular control and political equality, using the assessment framework prepared by the internationally based intergovernmental organization, the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), whose aim is to support sustainable democracy around the world. The method prepared by International IDEA was based on the claim that &quot;democracy is not an all-or-nothing affair&quot; but is a shifting continuum. The IDEA method acknowledges that the democracy practiced in some countries is not perfect and is subject to the country&apos;s historical experiences, demographics, cultures, and realities.
      This study&apos;s results suggest that having partially practiced democratic principles, with support from semi-authoritarian apparatus, produces a political system with both positive and negative components that both facilitate regime transition and democratization as well as reinforce regime incumbency and dampen democratization. This study shows that, ultimately, the interactions between the positive and negative components may produce balancing mechanisms that help to strengthen both the regime&apos;s persistence and the country&apos;s resilience.

  <dc:title>Aging and Technology Perspectives of Web-Based Chronic Disease Self-Management</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Many people suffer from chronic disease; however, older adults are at greatest risk of chronic conditions. Although social workers regularly engage with chronically ill older adults, they are not noticeably involved with the research and development of chronic disease management. As such, with recent movements toward health information technology, the efficacy of technology-based chronic disease management is not well established for older adults. Informed by theories of self-management, human development, and technology design, this research investigated lifespan differences of web-based chronic disease self-management. Using a sequential mixed methods design, a secondary data analysis of a diabetes specific web-based self-management intervention (n=462) was performed, followed by qualitative focus groups with 40 older intervention participants, and then mixed for overall interpretation. Results indicated that social workers must take a leadership role in the evaluation and implementation of web-based self-management for older adults to address identified lifespan differences.

  <dc:title>Rethinking the Adventure Education Experience: An Inquiry of Meanings, Culture and Educational Virtue</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study is an investigation of the adventure education (AE) experience with particular attention to what happens during the AE experience, the meanings participants ascribe to the experience, how personal backgrounds and institutional cultures coalesce in AE, and the significance of the AE experience for schooling. These topics are explored through observing and interviewing participants of adventure education programs under the qualitative framework of educational connoisseurship and criticism. The experiences at the three sites of study--an outdoor challenge course, a wilderness backpacking expedition and a summer adventure program--are described in detail and illustrated through the qualities of the experience (celebratory challenge, novelty, freedom and togetherness, aesthetic vitality, and great experience), cultural coalescence in AE (depicted through cultural rigidity and flexibility), and the participant perceptions of schooling. Findings are inferred through recommendations for AE, including consideration of the qualities of experience, striking a cultural balance in AE, and embodying a shift in thinking regarding the purpose of the AE experience. This study also provokes a reconsideration of contemporary educational paradigms, as the participant perceptions of schooling, when considered alongside the AE experience, provide a fresh perspective of the qualities of educational experience.

  <dc:title>Authenticity in Education: Theory Into Practice</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study investigates the role of authenticity in education. By applying Fred Newmann&apos;s theoretical framework of authentic achievement to a specific, K-12 setting operating in the real world, I examined Newmann&apos;s five facets of authentic education and looked for their practical manifestations. Those facets are higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connectedness to the world beyond the classroom, substantive conversation, and social support for student achievement. Parker Palmer inspired the addition of the criteria of the spiritual/ineffable to the framework, which is also examined in relation to authentic pedagogy. Combined, these qualities are referred to as the authentic education framework (AEF). Qualitative data from The Spring School (pseudonym) on the east coast of the United States has been collected and analyzed through the lens of educational connoisseurship and criticism. This research method permits the researcher to provide thick description, interpretation, and evaluation and to draw on themes presented in the data analysis. Qualitative methods of data collection including interview, observation, and artifact review were corroborated. Because the administration of the school changed during the data analysis phase and no longer operates under the philosophy under which this study occurred, this paper has become an historical narrative.
      	The findings that emerged reveal that the following factors aid in the realization of authentic pedagogy at the elementary-school level: (1) school trust, (2) opportunities for aesthetic transformative experiences, (3) works toward a greater good, and (4) the role of the community. The notions of sincerity, honesty, relevance and wholisitic teaching in the school context were also evident.  Findings also underscore the importance of a well-developed and thoroughly considered school philosophy. This study confirms that the processes of teaching and learning are personal in nature and relative to context and that prescribed curricula and confining pedagogical methods are antithetical to the development of opportunities for authentic teaching and learning.

  <dc:title>Study the Carrier Frequecny Offset (CFO) for wireless OFDM</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Due to high proficiency with high bandwidth efficiency, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been selected for broadband wireless communication systems. Since OFDM can provide large data rates with sufficient robustness to radio channel impairments, and due to its robustness against the multipath delay spread, OFDM has always been a designated technique for broadband wireless communication mobile systems. Nevertheless, OFDM suffers from Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO). CFO has been recognized as a major disadvantage of OFDM. CFO can lead to the frequency mismatch in transmitter and receiver oscillator. Lack of the synchronization of the local oscillator signal (L.OSC), for down conversion in the receiver with the carrier signal contained in the received signal, can cause the performance of OFDM to degrade. In other words, the orthogonality of the OFDM relies on the condition that the transmitter and receiver operate with exactly the same frequency reference. If this is not the case, the perfect orthogonality of the subcarrier will be lost, which can result in CFO. In this research, the source of creating CFO and the major CFO estimation algorithms have been reviewed and discussed in literature. We then proposed some algorithms and techniques for estimating and compensating for the effect of CFO. We showed that our proposed methods have a better performance with low complexity.

  <dc:title>Disrupting Privilege: A High School Curriculum</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Current privilege pedagogy scholarship demonstrates the importance of understanding privilege as an entryway into critical studies and everyday community engagement. Thus, this dissertation argues that privilege must be introduced into education earlier, such as high school. In order to demonstrate ethical possibilities of meeting the need for care, this project integrates social work and critical pedagogy scholarship that explores teaching privilege in the classroom, with culture and communication scholarship. This dissertation connects culture and communication, critical pedagogy, and performance to demonstrate an applied use of communication scholarship in two classroom settings to explore dialogues of privilege through a curriculum titled &quot;Disrupting Privilege.&quot; To do this, this dissertation uses critical pedagogy as a method of teaching &quot;Disrupting Privilege&quot; in the two classrooms and narrative ethnography as a method of analysis of what happened communicatively and performatively in the classrooms. The use of narrative ethnography forefronts student voices to guide the analysis of this dissertation. 
      In &quot;Disrupting Privilege,&quot; an analysis of communication components shows how communication was used to structure and facilitate critical conversations of privilege in the classroom. This structure and facilitation of communication created a space where emotion was brought into the classroom through privilege, pedagogy, and performance. By looking at the communicative and emotional aspects of these two classrooms we see demonstrations of classroom change and transformation. Therefore, this dissertation sets an example of how the use of communication and emotion, as seen in the  &quot;Disrupting Privilege&quot; curriculum, can be used in high school to transform individuals and communities by analyzing what happened in each of these classrooms. The hope is that, through these narratives, student voices and experiences become a way to understand the capacity for high school students to struggle through critical conversations and performances about privilege. Involving high school students more often in these conversations, can teach students to think critically and engage in disrupting systems of power and, in return, potentially transform communities as well as pave the way for deeper, more sophisticated conversations in college.

  <dc:title>Novel functions for neuronal RNA processing bodies in the control of axon terminal growth in Drosophila melanogaster</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      In this thesis we first characterized neuronal functions for HPat/Pat1, a core component of RNA processing bodies or &quot;P bodies&quot;. We show that hpat mutants exhibit a strong synaptic hyperplasia at the developing and acutely stimulated Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The synaptic defects observed in hpat mutants are associated with rearrangement of the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton suggesting that HPat negatively regulates presynaptic microtubule-based growth during NMJ development. Interestingly, we also found that both pre-and postsynaptic HPat expression controlled rapid axon terminal growth in response to acute spaced synaptic stimulation. We also demonstrate that HPat interacts genetically with the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase complex (twin/CCR4) and the miRNA pathway (Argonaute 1) to control bouton formation. We propose that HPat is required to target mRNAs involved in the control of microtubule architecture and synaptic terminal growth for repression, presumably in P bodies, via both general and miRNA-mediated mechanisms. 
             Next, we investigated whether HPat interacts with the Drosophila Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (dFMR1), to regulate neuronal structure in a Drosophila melanogaster fragile X model. First, we demonstrated that HPat interacts biochemically with dFMRP in an RNAse independent manner. Second, we show that HPat genetically interacts with dFmr1 in the Drosophila eye although the phenotype is weak, however we did not see any interaction of hpat and dfmr1 to control synaptic structure at the NMJ. Finally, we screened additional P body components that might have function in FMRP mediated translation regulation. Interestingly, a luciferase-based translational repression tethering assays in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells showed the function of GW182 in FMRP-mediated translation regulation.

  <dc:title>An Assessment of Character and Leadership Development Latent Factor Structures through Confirmatory Factor, Item Response Theory, and Latent Class Analyses</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study leveraged the complementary nature of confirmatory factor (CFA), item response theory (IRT), and latent class (LCA) analyses to strengthen the rigor and sophistication of evaluation of two new measures of the Air Force Academy&apos;s &quot;leader of character&quot; definition--the Character Mosaic Virtues (CMV) and the Leadership Mosaic Inventory (LMI).  Special CFA methods involving robust weighted least squares estimation were implemented to analyze the rated responses through linear structural equation modeling.  Most informative at the subscale level, the CFA techniques provided evidence of factorial validity and other desirable psychometric properties in support of previous exploratory results for a nine-factor CMV and a unidimensional LMI.  As an alternative to CFA, IRT&apos;s nonlinear approach and capability of estimating the probability of a response based on the amount of a latent trait was applied to the CMV and LMI data.  Most informative at the item level, individual item difficulty parameters were estimated as the amount of the latent trait required for a cadet to give a particular response to an item and mapped against person ability estimates.  The IRT analyses were extended to explore the underlying dimensions of the CMV and LMI through multidimensional IRT (MIRT)--results supporting the theoretical dimensional structure of the CMV were substantiated while new evidence of a multidimensional LMI structure was concluded.  LCA techniques permitted the inference of classifying mixtures of unobserved cadet subpopulations based on their responses to the CMV and LMI.  The analyses uncovered the meaning and number of underlying subpopulations not evident through the other two traditional factor structure analysis techniques.  The creation of the study&apos;s latent class models complemented the more traditional dimensional approaches of structure assessment with an understanding of the unobserved cadet subpopulations which could lead to future targeted cadet developmental opportunities being applied at organizational levels or groups deficient in certain latent traits.  By exposing more researchers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders to these three advanced psychometric evaluation methods, this study benefited the fields of moral development and leadership development, especially at the nation&apos;s service academies.

  <dc:title>A Pilot Study Exploring the Educational and Social/Emotional Benefits of Web-based Groups for Parents of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Research has indicated that parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) experience more feelings of isolation, depression and stress than those of children with other disorders including ADHD and Down Syndrome.  While these feelings are especially elevated in parents living in rural communities who may have limited access to services, they are also present in those living in urban areas but are restricted due to challenges with childcare, transportation, finances and time.  Furthermore, research posits that services for parents of the newly diagnosed or of younger children are abundant while services and education for parents of adolescents are hard to access regardless of location. This study explored the use of technology as a viable option for providing education and emotional support to parents of adolescents with ASDs and may assist in guiding future studies of this nature.  Group sessions were facilitated remotely using video-conference technology and covered the topics of stress reduction, IEP&apos;s, puberty, and the transition to adulthood.  This study employed a mixed methods design that utilized a concurrent triangulation approach. Within this approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently and then compared to determine if there was convergence, differences, or some combination. The quantitative tools included, first, the Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA) which was used to measure any change in stress levels that occurred throughout the treatment.  Pretest/posttest measures were then used to measure knowledge acquisition. The data gathered from these tools were then analyzed using a t test for paired samples. The qualitative phase employed a questionnaire that obtained anecdotal information regarding participants&apos; experiences with and preferences towards parent groups; their feelings of depression, isolation, stress related to parenting a child with ASD; their confidence regarding the topics of stress reduction, IEP&apos;s, puberty, and the transition to adulthood; and their experiences within the web-based group setting. This qualitative information was used to look for themes to begin to understand how parents of adolescents with ASD may benefit from groups provided using Internet technology.

  <dc:description>There has been steady interest in the ideology of equity in schooling practices reflected in the written artifacts of the United States, especially in the last thirty years. However, equality-laden language is often used without definition or critical examination. The assumed meaning of equality terminology is problematic--especially for classroom teachers who are directly held accountable for the practice of equality policy. This inquiry critically evaluates the multiple implications of this common-sense usage of language related to issues of equality, equity, sameness, and even democracy. Using the combined methodologies of educational criticism, critical discourse analysis, and self-ethnography, this transdisciplinary investigation describes, interprets, and evaluates the way staff members in a Head Start/early childhood education organization conceive of, and act upon, conceptualizations of equality policy. A close examination of these conceptualizations can serve to assist educational researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in evaluating the implications equality policies have on the teaching practice as a whole, and by extension, the specific learning lives of students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Under what conditions do multiethnic political parties win elections in deeply divided societies? Using the cases of India, Indonesia, and South Africa, this dissertation first argues that the nature of liberation movements creates a soft path dependence that affects party formation. Ethnically inclusive liberation movements create conditions conducive to the formation of multiethnic political parties. Yet after this juncture point of party formation, multiethnic politics have dominated India and Indonesia while South Africa has experienced a slow degeneration into ethnic politics. To explain this divergence, this dissertation next examines the interaction of election rules and ethnic cleavage structure. India and Indonesia reinforce broadly crosscutting cleavages with multiple-district and candidate-centered elections. This forces parties to contest elections in ethnically diverse districts with local candidates, which encourages broad-based, inclusive political appeals. South Africa&apos;s electoral system does the opposite. Its functionally single-district proportional representation system incentivizes identity politics by translating control of the ethnic majority into control of parliamentary power. This has resulted in the slow degeneration of Mandela&apos;s multiethnic liberation movement into an ethnically exclusive political party</dc:description>
