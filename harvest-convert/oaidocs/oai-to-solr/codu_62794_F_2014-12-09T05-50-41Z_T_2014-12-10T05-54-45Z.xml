  <dc:description>The optimization of an on-orbit Cryogenic Propellant Storage (CPS) system enables human exploration missions by reducing launch vehicle mass to orbit requirements and providing an extensible approach for human spaceflight missions to near-Earth asteroids, the moon, and Mars.  The optimal CPS sun-shield design and attitude control approach documented herein minimizes LH2 boiloff to near zero boiloff in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using only passive thermal control techniques, eliminating the need for developing complex and costly active thermal control systems. The optimal CPS system design leverages the current human spaceflight infrastructure resulting in a new mission concept that achieves lower tank temperatures, leading to boiloff rates more than six times better than the best published results. The complexities and interdependencies of the CPS system design variables led to the creation of a tool capable of automated exploration of the CPS system design space using a Monte Carlo process with variable manipulation, as well as a new orbital thermal analysis global optimization tool that can be utilized for other complex orbital thermal design problems. The optimization tool interface provides a new industry approach for design optimization of on-orbit spacecraft.

  <dc:description>This dissertation, Valuing, takes its title and inspiration from Allen Grossman’s unorthodox understanding of value in True-Love: Essays on Poetry &amp; Valuing. Grossman sees our most human acts of valuation as transcendent of the orthodoxy it is commonly associated with because it is “held in the mind as prior to philosophy and religion and is indistinguishable from love.” A version of humanism, perhaps, in terms of its rejection of normative structures, Grossman’s valuing, as I see it, is more unorthodox and subversive than traditional humanism because it depicts valuing as a preternatural capacity, as prior to language—the necessary foundation of philosophy and religion. Before we speak, we value and bestow upon others the otherness that sparks relation, love and society. But after valuing comes language, and with language comes conflict. We rationalize. We lie. We lose connection to the natural phenomena that shape our experience. “Our ties to beings and things are so fragile,” writes Edmond Jabès, “they often break without us noticing,” and this fragility comes 
about because of language, because  of  the  distance  that  language inflicts.  My  dissertation seeks  to  bridge  this distance, to explore valuing as the foundation of human origin and the catalyst for human rights that it is. And yet it has to navigate this distance using the very mode—language— that established it. This is where poetry comes in with its aesthetic agility, its “uncanny learning,” as Grossman describes it. Poetry is the mode of inquiry uniquely capable of exploring these ideas because it manifests the pre-verbal—human origins—and the post-verbal—human rights—what goes without saying. This dissertation seeks to harness this 
“uncanny learning” in an attempt to value again and to rectify the lapses that separate us from our actions, our objects and ourselves.

  <dc:description>A book of prose, poetry, and visual elements which embraces a tension between Midwestern realism and bucolic lyricism, absence and presence, letter and hand; moreover, the sounds and silences between the hearing and the deaf as seen through an appropriated “I.” My goal is for the reader to notice how absence occupies the page, to in
turn cause the reader to wonder how silence functions in-between sections, how it activates in everyday life, how it purposed the narrative past depicted in the book. I enhance this later hope through the utilization of paratactic style to empower the transitions between a sequence of hazy images that evoke not only the lake-effected
experience of the Michigan from which I came, but also the elusive task of conjuring memory itself. My hope is that the content asserts a pastoral brand of banality while the hands of the manual alphabet embody a sense of the senses (sight, hearing) and the lack thereof (silences, deafness) while interpreting through a blurring of experiences where one sense doesn’t serve; where one alphabet doesn’t suffice. </dc:description>

  <dc:description>Sexual Violence victim advocacy agencies are dominated by White women advocates often creating barriers for women of color survivors seeking assistance (Tillmann et al, 2010; Washington, 2001). White women’s dual and sometimes conflicting locations of race (White) and gender (woman) influence how they practice advocacy. Communication scholarship has provided little research in this area tending to focus on the experiences of survivors of sexual violence or larger forms of advocacy. In this research, I explore the personal narratives of six White women advocates in addition to my own autoethnographic journey to examine how we negotiate and communicate our identities as both oppressor and oppressed when advocating for women of color. The results—our stories, experiences, and perspectives—shed light on how power is communicated in a space that is intended to be safe and empowering. Emergent themes included a difficulty in addressing race, specifically whiteness, in our advocacy, an inability to sit at the intersection of White womanhood, and the utilization of womanhood as a primary point of connection with women of color survivors. In addition to these primary themes, smaller themes surfaced. These included the problem of speaking for others, White motherhood, the influence of whiteness on their advocacy, the good (White) girl, and White benevolence or threads of the White hero or savior.The advocacy relationship is inherently communicative, engaging narratives of both power and marginalization. It is a practice and location of empowerment yet as the results identify, it has the capacity to reify dominant notions of whiteness and womanhood. While all the advocates in the study endeavor to practice inclusive advocacy when working with women survivors of color, narratives of White supremacy bleed into their work. Shades of the White hero or savior manifest in their desire to help and do the right thing, as well as implicit, and sometimes explicit, narratives of White womanhood as inherently good and selfless. My research demonstrates that when White women are the ones speaking for women of color survivors, they cannot escape the influence of their social location on how they engage in speaking for their clients. </dc:description>

  <dc:description>Retail therapy, or shopping to improve our mood, develops as a rhetorical force that operates quietly, but forcefully in culture to keep capitalism intact. Retail therapy is a compilation of therapeutic narratives about shopping’s ability to give purpose and meaning to life. This dissertation composes a constellation of retail therapy, or rhetorical forces that construct, define, administer, and evaluate capitalistic norms as they engage with other narratives and artifacts (including institutions, space, and messages) in society. To map out the constellation of retail therapy the author examines the relationships between personal narrative (collected through interviews with self-declared avid shoppers who claim to do retail therapy) and master narratives 
distributed through pop cultures (advertisements, T.V. shows, magazines, blogs, songs etc.). The connections among these narratives operate as rhetorical forces that govern individuals’ lives and cultural norms. Three themes emerged from the analysis of this data. First, this dissertation illuminates how personal and master narratives frame retail therapy as a natural and necessary facet of human nature. The second theme parses out retail therapy as a means for exercising control over life’s circumstances. The final theme explores how narratives about retail therapy frame shopping as an acceptable addiction. Together these themes illuminate the way shoppers and society frame retail therapy as a constraint and also an essential source of freedom. They also lay the foundation for theorizing social change.

  <dc:description>This dissertation, Uncountry, explores the gap between “remembered” official history and the more unreliable spaces of private memory and silent unofficial history. It aims to expand creative pathways into historical space, particularly histories of migration and displacement, and sets out to create both a map of belonging as well as
walking the reader towards the nomadic spaces of dreams, memories and myths. I am specifically interested in the potential of cross-pollinating multiple sources of memory. How does the memory of my family’s migration (or its anecdotal narratives) intersect with my personal memory of visiting the Ukraine and the public documents that have recorded immigrants’ arrival in Ellis Island? What narratives emerge from collective remembrance and witness, and how does the engagement of diverse memory banks disrupt cohesive truth telling? The work resists closure and embraces the accumulation of multiple characters, histories, and experiences centering on archaic motifs as passed down through early written texts, such as the Hebrew Bible. Midrash is a further structural approach to move narratives beyond their own time-space limitations, their absences and silences, providing a manifold commentary on an original source text. Similarly to Susan Handelman’s comparison of Jabès’ work as an example of midrashic literature (60), characterized by the juxtaposition and varying of interpretations,
Uncountry also employs a wide scope of narrative time and space, invested less in chronos, and rather embracing the Greek kairos.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A novel and a critical preface. In the preface, the author attempts the first formation of an epistemological definition/description of weird within a literary contexts as well as the experience of weirdness itself. It analyzes works by authors Dennis Johnson and William Golding, among others, as well as number of extradiegetic
examples, drawing on theorists Julia Kristeva, Tzvetan Todorov, Yuri Lotman and Aleksander Piatigorski, Jean-Paul Sartre, St. Augustine of Hippo, Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot, and Plato to articulate a poetics relevant to the novel—and to the weird. The poetics suggests that the experience of weirdness is a deformation of psychological, emotional, and conceptual givens, and as such may be either a danger to or a liberating of notions and definitions of identity. The novel, while it is its own autonomous work, attempts to enact forms of weirdness across multiple registers such as described in the preface.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>SCRIMSHAW is a work of fiction composed of prose vignettes and prose poems, ‘translations’ of photographs and films, and assimilated/appropriated texts—all of which trace one troubled family’s century-spanning story as it attempts to inhabit the unstable space of memory. The fragmentary quality of the work’s construction speaks to the way in which the family memory is lashed together from stories, snippets of overheard conversation, photographs, letters, documents, shifting allegiances and alliances, and informational gaps and overlap, all of which cohere around a narrative framework in order to tell the story of a private history. Each page of the text 
becomes an installation space curated by the family’s remaining member, and each element of story is presented as an exhibit—a word intended to invoke both the art gallery and the courtroom.

  <dc:description>In my dissertation, I examine two main research questions: 1. Can we regard democracy as the new standard of civilization and the new wave expansion of international society in the post-Cold War era and in the 21st century? and 2. Should we think that each path toward democracy is relatively different based on the characteristics of each international society and the internal and external variables of each state? In my dissertation, I use typology to demonstrate that each country has taken its own unique path toward democracy, and that democracy has become the post-Cold War and 21st century new standard of civilization and new wave expansion of international society. A pluralist international society, a solidarist international society, and a liberal anti-pluralist international society have influenced paths toward democracy, along with institutions such as international law, diplomacy, Great Powers and international organizations. In addition to those, internal variables such as each country&apos;s history, culture, politics, economy, military power and foreign policy can also influence paths toward democracy. However, in my dissertation, I primarily focus on the characteristics of international society and institutions rather than internal variables in order to examine the different paths toward democracy. Case studies on countries such as China, South Korea, and Iraq can help demonstrate that each type of international society as well as external and internal variables can have an impact on paths toward democracy. In the case of China, democratization can be viewed in the context of interest-oriented socialization. In South Korea, it can be viewed as value-oriented socialization, and, finally, in Iraq, it can be viewed as the use of force. To conclude, democracy is gradually becoming the post-Cold War and 21st century new standard of civilization and new wave expansion of international society, and each country&apos;s path toward democracy is relatively different based on each circumstance.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Education policy has focused on teacher quality and student achievement since the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, which defined teacher quality in terms of teachers&apos; professional qualifications and certification. This is consistent with a history of econometric studies examining the effects of teacher background characteristics on student achievement. More recently, researchers have argued that investigations of teacher effectiveness should examine what actually happens in the classroom, and that teacher attitudes and instructional practices are conspicuously missing from the prior research. This study uses a two-phase parallel mixed methods design to explore teacher perceptions of the influence of their background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement. The first phase is a quantitative analysis using structural equation modeling and data from the Early-Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to examine the relative effects of teacher background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement. The second phase is a case study of an innovative elementary school meeting State expectations for student growth.  The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that teacher attitudes typically have a significant effect on student achievement, but teacher background characteristics and perceptions related to their instructional practices do not. The teachers in the case study agreed that teacher attitudes are important and are likely to have an effect on students, as well as on other teachers. However, the teachers in the case study also perceived that a number of instructional practices are crucial to increasing student achievement and closing achievement gaps.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Autism is a debilitating disorder (Yurov et al., 2007) that is diagnosed in 1 in 88 children in America (CDC, 2012). The autism population overwhelmingly performs weakest in reading comprehension as compared to other academic areas (Chiang &amp; Lin, 2007; Minshew, 1994). This identified weaknesses is concerning because comprehension is understood in the literature as the most critical curricular area (Chiang &amp; Lin, 2007). One potential reason for these comprehension problems could be impaired imagery. &lt;/DISS_para&gt;

&lt;DISS_para&gt;Neuropsychology research has found that children with autism cognitively process imagery differently than typical children, due to their unique brain structures (Just, Cherkassky, Keller, &amp; Minshew, 2004). This study sought to uncover whether or not children with autism show weaker abilities on imagery-related comprehension tasks than typical children. However, no instrument exists that is validated for this purpose.&lt;/DISS_para&gt;

&lt;DISS_para&gt;Archived diagnostic data were examined to develop a scale to assess imagery-related comprehension skills. Data were analyzed from 71 children (N=71), with and without autism, aged 5-13. A four phase approach from Benson &amp; Clark (1982) was used to develop the instrument. A multiple regression analytic method was used to see whether or not diagnosis was a significant predictor of scores on the imagery scale. Results were that children with autism scored significantly lower than typically developing children, controlling for the effects of IQ, age, and gender. Implications for practice are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation uses the connections between loops and their associated permutation groups to study certain varieties of loops. We first define a variety of loops generalizing commutative automorphic loops and show this new variety is power associative. We show a correspondence to Bruck loops of odd order and use this correspondence to give structural results for our new variety, which in turn hold for commutative automorphic loops. Next, we study a variety of loops that generalize both Moufang and Steiner loops. We extend on known results for Moufang loops and then extend two different doubling constructions for creating Moufang and other varieties of loops. We then give a general construction to create simple RCC loops from $GL(2,q)$ for $q$ a prime power. Finally, we consider a generalization of Bruck loops, and show that different companions of pseudoautomorphism live in certain subloops.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In 2013, many public education reform efforts in the United States of America center on testing and accountability. Recent data revealed that teachers have the single greatest in-school impact on student learning; however, the methods to assess teacher effectiveness are widely criticized for not holding teachers accountable and, consequently, are experiencing significant legislative attention. In 2010, Colorado passed Senate Bill 10-191: The Great Teachers and Leaders Act to improve student learning by revising teacher and principal evaluations, including linking them to student learning data, and eradicating tenure. Teachers, administrators, and policymakers hold critical roles in the implementation of this bill, yet little is known about how members of each group perceive their respective roles in the implementation. This explanatory sequential mixed methods study was designed to gather perception data from these three groups, through surveys and interviews. Data revealed that teachers and administrators do not have similar perceptions of many matters related to teacher evaluations, education reform, and the implementation of Senate Bill 10-191 (SB 191). The data also revealed that teachers and administrators expected they would agree on these matters. These collective findings led to multiple recommendations, such as the need for increased dialogue between teachers and administrators about their own perceptions of education reforms.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Even 150 years after Charles Darwin published &lt;italic&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/italic&gt;, public school teachers still find themselves dealing with student resistance to learning about biological evolution. Some teachers deal with this pressure by undermining, de-emphasizing, or even omitting the topic in their science curriculum. Others face the challenge and deliver solid scientific instruction of evolutionary theory despite the conflicts that may arise. The latter were the topic of this study.  I interviewed five teachers that had experience dealing with resistance to learning evolution in their school community. Through these in-depth interviews, I examined strategies these teachers use when facing resistance and how they help students deal with the cognitive dissonance that may be experienced when learning about evolution. I selected the qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship to organize and categorize my data.  From the interviews, the following findings emerged. Experienced teachers increased their confidence in teaching evolution by pursuing outside professional development. They not only learned more about evolutionary theory, but about creationist arguments against evolution. These teachers front-load their curriculum to integrate the nature of science into their lessons to address misunderstandings about how science works. They also highlight the importance of learning evolutionary theory but ensure students they do not have an agenda to indoctrinate students. Finally these experienced teachers work hard to create an intellectually safe learning environment to build trusting and respectful relationships with their students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Among the reasons behind construction of the light rail system in the 1990s and 2000s and currently the FasTracks lines, in Denver metro region, has been reduction of traffic congestion and consolidation of land use. This research analyzes the success of the rail transit system in achieving the above-mentioned goals. 
A temporal and spatial analysis of Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data from 1992 to 2008 on the highways in Denver has been conducted to determine if traffic congestion has reduced after the initial light rail service began in 1994. Temporal analysis provides an insight into the changes in the level of highway traffic before and after the opening of three segments (Central, Southwest, and Southeast Corridors) of the light rail system. This part of the analysis also compares the traffic levels of highways affected by light rail with those not affected by light rail. Spatial analysis examines whether the changes have taken place uniformly throughout all the highways, or whether they have been concentrated on particular highways. Results indicate that light rail has reduced level of traffic along some of the adjacent highways for a short period of time. Overall, the three light rail corridors in operation have succeeded in lowering the rate of increase in the level of traffic on highways near the rail transit as compared to highways not near the rail transit. Change in the amount of different types of land use namely commercial, mixed, industrial, multi-family residential, and single-family residential has been examined from 1990 to 2010 for Denver and surrounding counties to determine whether greater developments have taken place within the rail transit corridors than outside. The change has been analyzed in terms of total square footage of the building areas as well as land use density. Besides descriptive statistics, inferential statistics have been used for Denver County only, to determine if the changes are significantly different within and outside the rail transit corridors. The growth of commercial land use has been higher within the rail transit corridors in all the counties. The growth has been statistically significant for Denver County. Single-family residential land use has noticeable increased outside the rail transit corridors in all the counties. However, the growth has not been statistically significant throughout the study time period in Denver County. The other types of land use have not shown any consistent pattern in their growth. Overall, the present and proposed rail transit lines in Denver metro region have been very successful in consolidating commercial land use around them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Teacher burn out contributes to the epidemic of early career exit. At least half of all new K-12 teachers leave the profession by the time they reach their fifth year of teaching. Conversely, there are urban teachers who survive burn out and thrive as career- long educators. This qualitative study is an in-depth look into one 40-year veteran teacher&apos;s career narrative, answering the question: How did this teacher not only survive but also thrive as a career-long urban teacher? Additionally, the following sub-questions are explored: a) How is her spirit sustained throughout her teacher life cycle? b) How can her story contribute to the literature as a counter-narrative to the current rhetoric focused on &quot;teacher bashing&quot;? A critical socio-political lens guides this study. The socio-political forces that lead to urban teacher burn out are explained. The idea of teacher burn in, in which educators experience the symptoms of burn out, but choose to remain in the profession and exist as toxic influences, is discussed and related to teacher career theory. However, the more hopeful idea of urban teacher thrival is uncovered through narrative methodology. This narrative study reveals three salient themes. First hope springs eternal is the idea that sustaining hope supported the veteran teacher&apos;s career thrival. Next, the extended education family is the notion that familial-like relationships at school nourished the teacher&apos;s longevity. The third theme, creative autonomy, reveals that by being empowered with opportunities for curriculum development and instructional decision-making the teacher maintained her passion. Each theme was influenced by the participant&apos;s internal dispositional factors and external conditional factors. These factors are discussed. The above themes, combined with deeply rooted caring relationships with students, proved to be the most important aspects of the participant&apos;s sustained spirit. Furthermore, this study illustrates how teacher narratives can act as counter-narratives to teacher bashing through revealing the systemic impact that can be made by the career of one thriving teacher. Implications for teachers, educational leaders, teacher educators and researchers are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Psychotherapy research reveals consistent associations between therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes in the youth and adult literature. Despite these consistent findings, prospective associations are not sufficient to support the claim that the alliance is a change mechanism in psychotherapy. The current study examined the direction of effect of the alliance- outcome relationship, the contribution of early symptom change in treatment to the development of therapeutic alliance, and the potential for pretreatment interpersonal functioning characteristics to be third variables that account for the association between alliance and outcome. Participants were adolescents with depression and a history of interpersonal trauma that presented to a community mental health center for treatment. Findings demonstrated that a more positive therapeutic alliance predicted greater subsequent symptom improvement, even after removing symptom change occurring before the measurement of alliance. Results also suggested that early change only slightly contributed to alliance development. Finally, though pretreatment interpersonal functioning was related to the first session alliance, these pretreatment client characteristics were not related to later alliance or symptom change. Overall, results provided some support for therapeutic alliance as a mechanism of change in psychotherapy. Methodological and clinical issues are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Techno-economic and systems studies on microalgal growth scenarios to date are abbreviated and missing a number of important variables. By including these variables in a detailed model integrating biology, chemistry, engineering, and financial aspects, a more defined systems analysis is possible. Through optimizing the model productivity based on the resulting net profit, the system analysis results in a more accurate assessment of environmental and economic sustainability of specific algal growth scenarios. Photobioreactor algal growth scenario optimization in the system model has resulted in realistic engineering design requirements based on algal growth requirements and fluid dynamics analysis. Results show feasibility for photobioreactor growth scenarios to be economically sustainable when co-products are included, but definite technological advancements and productivity improvements must be made. The main factors inhibiting a cost effective photobioreactor growth scenario are culture density, temperature, and lighting distribution for solar illuminated photobioreactors, and lighting cost for artificially illuminated photobioreactors. Open pond algal growth scenarios do not show any prospect of economic or environmental sustainability with current technology due to the large amount of surface area required, inefficient water use, and low culture density. All algal growth scenarios are inferior to petro-diesel regarding energy inputs, carbon emissions, and environmental sustainability. No algal growth scenarios analyzed in this study meet the U.S. requirement of biofuel emitting at least 20% less carbon emissions than diesel from crude oil.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Algebra is typically the gatekeeper for higher-level math coursework. Low math performance on standardized assessments impedes access to these higher-level math classes. Limited math progress in high school affects future career opportunities and quality of life. High school students who have historically struggled with math need interventions that work. Research indicates that the research on reading interventions far outnumbers the research on math interventions. With the passage of new federal legislation requiring schools to document progress for all groups of students and allowing schools to use Response to Intervention models, the need for evidence based math interventions becomes even more pressing. This research examined the effects of the MIND Research Institute&apos;s Algebra Readiness program in order to provide an evidence base for this intervention. In this pre- experimental study, two groups of high school students were exposed to the MIND Research Institute&apos;s Algebra Readiness program and changes in their math performance were analyzed. Students with and without diagnosed disabilities, were assigned to two tiers of intervention. The double dosed students received instruction with the core Algebra I curriculum and the Algebra Readiness program whereas the single dosed students only received the Algebra Readiness intervention. Independent samples t-tests; ANCOVA, percentage change, qualitative teacher responses and correlation procedures were used to analyze the scores of students. The outcome measures included scores on a post test, grade level curriculum based measures and the state sponsored standardized assessment. Because of limited sample size and possible lack of sensitivity of the outcome measures, overall no significant growth was detected. The students who were double dosed showed significant growth on the end of year, grade level assessment as compared to those students who only participated in the intervention. Although the sample size was small, the effect sizes were large, indicating potential practical significance for this intervention. This research suggests that using visual spatial representations in a mostly nonverbal, computer-based format may show promise as an intervention for students. More research with a larger sample size and a more controlled research design will help definitively answer the questions about the effectiveness of the Algebra Readiness program</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Harmonics are always present in electrical power systems. Harmonic distortion is harmless as long as its level is within the limit. However, with the recent rapid advancement of power electronics, i.e. non linear loads, the use of the variable speed drives are increasing day by day. Harmonics produced by non-linear loads are a potential risk if they are not evaluated, predicted, and controlled. The power electronic switching devices like thyristor used in the rectifier circuits inject harmonic distortion to the utility grid in different applications. The harmonic distortion causes different problems in the power system. To minimize the unwanted effects of harmonic distortion, IEEE Std 519-1992 recommends the amount of harmonics that is acceptable in the power system. IEEE Std 519-1992 suggests that an individual harmonic distortion to be under 3% and the total harmonic distortion, THD, to be under 5% of the fundamental component. Harmonic distortion can be mitigated using different methods. Based on the system configuration either active filters, passive filters, or phase shifting methods are used. In medium voltage high power applications, generally, phase shifting method is better suited. In addition to harmonic distortion in AC side, AC-DC converter produce ripple in DC side. DC ripple can be mitigated by the use of filter circuits. However, when phase shifting method is used in AC side for harmonic mitigation, a method called pulse multiplication can be used in DC side to mitigate DC ripple. Phase shifting and pulse multiplication methods are investigated in detail in this research. A three-phase 6-pulse rectifier is modeled in Alternative Transients Program (ATP). Voltage and Current waveforms are obtained and the amount of harmonic distortion produced is calculated. It was found that the harmonic distortion produced by an ideal three-phase 6-pulse rectifier to be 31.1% and not under IEEE 519-1992 recommendation. Therefore a 12-pulse rectifier has been investigated. The analysis shows that a 12-pulse rectifier produces 15.3% THD and provides a window opportunity to be used in certain areas where the grid is comparatively stronger. For a rectifier to be able to be used without ac side filter and dc side filter, and to mitigate the THD under the IEEE std 519-1992 recommendation and the dc ripple under the specified value, a higher pulse rectifier will be needed. Further investigation is needed using 18-pulse and 24-pulse phase shifting rectifiers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation presents a design to examine the effects of environmental factors in a country such as education systems levels, corruption, and social freedoms on investment outcomes. The literature review suggests that countries with poor education at the secondary level tend to have lower standards of living, lower levels of freedom, as well as high levels of corruption which appear to have negative effects on their market economies. This study was designed to examine existing data from multiple sources along multiple dimensions, and use a hierarchical linear model, as well as a portfolio optimization model, to assess the impact of these factors. This was accomplished by posing research questions, and collecting and analyzing data from Standard and Poors, Transparency International, and the World Values Organization, as well as the Programe for International Student Assessment. The outcomes of this study generally support the thesis that country-level factors do, in fact, have a bearing on investment outcomes, and that further research in this area is warranted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This exploratory case study examined the perspectives of state-level elected officials regarding what influences policy decisions related to child abuse and neglect issues. By interviewing six former state-level elected officials, the study explored what policy makers believe about their ability to impact child abuse policies, how they define, and ways they have experienced. evidence-based policy, and what they know about risk factors and protective factors with regard to child abuse-related policy. The study design was inspired by the Harvard Family Research Project&apos;s (2005) Bellwether Methodology, which bases advocacy strategy on the knowledge base and input from influential policy makers. The findings from this study are intended to provide insights about how advocates, researchers, and other stakeholders can most effectively influence child abuse-related policy decisions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A novel architecture is presented for reducing communication delay variability for a group of robots. This architecture relies on using three components: a microprocessor architecture that allows deterministic real-time tasks; an event-based communication protocol in which nodes transmit in a TDMA fashion, without the need of global clock synchronization techniques; and a novel communication scheme that enables deterministic communications by allowing senders to transmit without regard for the state of the medium or coordination with other senders, and receivers can tease apart messages sent simultaneously with a high probability of success. This approach compared to others, allows simultaneous communications without regard for the state of the transmission medium, it allows deterministic communications, and it enables ordered communications that can be a applied in a team of robots. Simulations and experimental results are also included.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Poverty has been linked to reduced workforce opportunities, reduced college-going rates, increased social-emotional challenges, and even negative health consequences. Postsecondary educational opportunities, offered during high school, that contribute to the acquisition of social capital may improve academic outcomes for students from impoverished backgrounds. The Colorado concurrent enrollment legislation, provides one opportunity for students to enroll in college level coursework and receive college credits with tuition being paid through state funding while in high school. Concurrent enrollment (CE) programs support the college application, financial aid and enrollment processes. Most importantly, they also support the development of social networks that may foster beneficial secondary and postsecondary outcomes. This dissertation examines the participation and representation rates of free and reduced lunch (FRL) students in CE programs at the state and local level. Next, the impact of CE participation on secondary and postsecondary outcomes in students from impoverished backgrounds is examined. The quasi-experimental research design included a matched control group generated by logistic regression and propensity score matching techniques. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate unaccounted for variance that may have contributed to any observed between-group differences. Between-group differences were examined for a range of outcomes at the high school and postsecondary level. The study analysis was replicated utilizing two additional groups of program participants across two years to increase confidence in the obtained findings. Overall, the findings indicate that FRL students were underrepresented as concurrent enrollment participants during the 2010 and 2011 academic years. A limited number of local education agencies had FRL student participation rates that exceeded enrollment expectations. Statistical analysis indicated that FRL students earned CE credits at a lower rate than their non-eligible peers. In contrast, the FRL students enrolled for a larger number of CE credits than non-eligible students. Additional analysis revealed that a number of positive secondary and post-secondary outcomes were related to concurrent enrollment participation for economically disadvantaged students. The results of sensitivity analyses indicate that other, unaccounted for variables were unlikely to have impacted the obtained findings. The findings of this study indicate that concurrent enrollment opportunities may mitigate some of the deleterious impacts of poverty by improving academic achievement and college-going rates. The beneficial role of social capital for achievement of post-secondary success is discussed</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this dissertation, we discussed the shape, energy level and density of defects in Organic Photovoltaic devices(OPV) by both theoretical and experimental methods. Energy band structure and intrinsic junctions of general standard and inverted OPV devices are investigated in detail. Transportation of separated holes and electrons in both structure are well analyzed. In chapter II, we developed a Monte-Carlo model to simulate charge transport process in organic materials. Marcus theory is applied to calculate the carrier transfer rate to build up hopping process in ideal lattices. Results of this model showed several properties of carriers regarding mobility, reorganization energy and Poole-Frenkel behavior. Time-of-Flight(TOF) measurement is simulated by our Monte-Carlo model. Typical four phases of TOF are fitted in simulation exactly as in experiment data. In chapter III, we introduced Impedance Spectroscopy as a useful technique to examine overall electronic component and internal structure. Geometric capacitance and depletion region are found to describe the equivalent circuit of OPV. Another part of this chapter showed that impedance data can be also used by Mott-Schottky analysis to calculate the doping density and built-in voltage of schottky junction, which is widely considered existing in standard OPV devices. Degradation and Life time study are the major topics of chapter IV. We compared three devices within different thickness of active layers under different illumination intensity. Open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor are deeply analyzed to explain the decrease of conversion efficiency during degradation process. In addition, we present simple method to estimate the lifetime of free carriers. In chapter V, impedance spectroscopy is used to investigate the electronic structure of OPV devices, with the goal of understanding the role of defect states. Capacitance-voltage measurements in the temperature range of 77 - 300 K are carried out to determine the activation energy of trap states. Preliminary results show at least one type of defect state residing at 165.6 meV in standard blends of P3HT:PCBM. Furthermore we compared three different molecular weight of P3HT in both standard and inverted devices. Result shows that higher molecular weight provides deeper defects energy level, and density of defects generated during fabrication is different for standard and inverted structures. In chapter VI, JV curve behavior, Capacitor-Voltage analysis and efficiency comparison before annealing and after annealing are showed to conclude that P-N junction is formed at ZnO/P3HT interface in inverted device. We also discussed the free carrier transportation in both structure and explain why annealing leads to different conversion efficiency change. Finally the equivalent circuit is confirmed by geometric capacitance coincidence as well as structure and transportation analysis in whole dissertation</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study explores relationships among several established correlates of trauma in women exposed to intimate partner abuse (IPA), including PTSD, depression, and dissociation symptoms as well as alcohol use as well as other trauma-related variables, such as social support and violence exposure. Two analysis methods were utilized: variable-oriented methods, which examine relationships between variables, and person-oriented analysis methods, which examine groupings of participants within a larger sample (N = 233). Results of the variable-oriented analyses indicated positive links among depression, PTSD, dissociation, and alcohol use in women exposed to IPA, as well as positive links between the aforementioned psychological symptoms and exposure to violence. Social support was related to decreased psychological symptoms. Person-oriented analyses indicated the presence of four unique profiles of women within the larger study sample: Profile 1, which was labeled High Dissociation, Low Depression/PTSD; Profile 2, which was labeled Low Symptoms, High Social Support, Profile 3,  which was labeled Low Dissociation, High Depression/PTSD; and Profile 4, which was labeled High Symptoms, Low Social Support. This research supports previous findings about the relationships among several variables related to IPA as well as suggests the need for careful consideration of differences among women within the larger context of research, advocacy, and clinical interventions related to IPA.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>First, this research presents experimental and theoretical investigation of the response of micro scale dual-plate thermal-piezoresistive resonators (TPR) and self-sustained oscillators (TPO) to different gases and pressures. It is demonstrated that the resonant frequency of such devices follows particular trends in response to the changes in the surrounding gas and its pressure. A mathematical model has been derived to explain the damping dependent frequency shift characteristic of TPO. The solution of the model indicates that the stiffness of the actuator beam decreases as the value of damping coefficient drops at lower gas density caused by the change in the gas molecular mass or pressure. When operated in the TPR mode of the same device, however, the frequency shift of the same silicon structure is mainly a function of gas thermal conductivity. The two different sensing mechanisms are confirmed by the measurement results showing opposite frequency shift for the TPR and TPO in helium-nitrogen mixtures. In pressure tests, frequency shifts as high as -2300ppm were measured for a TPO by changing the air pressure from 84kPa to 43kPa. Second, the effect of geometry on thermoelastic damping (TED) in micro beam resonators is evaluated using an eigenvalue finite element formulation and its corresponding customized MATLAB program. The vented clamped-clamped (CC) and clamped-free (CF) beams with square-shaped vents along their center lines, are both analyzed. The quality factor and resonant frequency are obtained as functions of various geometrical parameters including the location, number and size of the vents. The numerical results reveal that the addition of vent sections in the clamped end region can significantly enhance the quality factor under TED. The maximum improved quality factor as high as 3,801 and 2,257 times as those of the solid CC and CF beams are realized. The methodology presented in this work provides a useful tool in the design optimization of micro beam resonators against TED. Third, a new method to compensate the TED by taking the advantage of piezoresistive effect is proposed. Such method is implemented by applying an electrostatic field through the MEMS beam resonator with negative piezoresistive coefficient. In the case of vibration, the stretched part of the beam generates higher electrical power thus higher temperature and vice versa. Such temperature distribution can compensate the opposite thermoelastic temperature to suppress TED. The work principle is described by a set of coupled differential equations and then solved by an eigenvalue finite element method. The numerical result indicates that the TED in beam resonators can be completely suppressed when the strength of electrical field reaches a critical value, namely CEF. The value of the CEF is further analyzed by parametric studies on various material properties and geometric factors</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Using the discourse of Political Theology as a mode of inquiry we can overcome a longstanding tension between aesthetics and history that characterized much of twentieth century thought. Focusing on literary and occasionally musical works from the mid twentieth century, my aim is to show how works displaying psychedelic aesthetics are important venues for political deliberation with regard to citizenship. Through affective means, psychedelic aesthetics re-imagine the boundaries of liberal subjectivity through a consciousness expansion and return from that expansion. The subject who returns from a psychedelic &quot;experience&quot; - which can be attained in various ways - comes to ethically realign and re-norm his or her &quot;self&quot; according to a moral authority beyond the authority of the nation state. While critical of liberalism on one level, this &quot;expanded&quot; citizenship ultimately offers liberalism political advice in crisis situations by performing a public sacrifice on the state and disseminating social responsibility to individuals. Psychedelic aesthetics perform this `public sacrifice&apos; through affective enchantment, using spiritual and religious rhetoric to change the relationship between citizen and state. Because artistic works of the mid twentieth century are essentially &quot;ahead of the game&quot; regarding states of exception and economic crises, it is to this period that we should look for methods of cultural recovery in current ones. But this requires that we take both aesthetic and religious enchantment seriously in a post-secular world</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation dwells on the intersections of language-use and perception. The premise is that language makes literal sense and this reality has profound implications for those Burke called &quot;symbol-using/mis-using animals.&quot; Communication scholars have long accepted a model of communication that positions language as &quot;constitutive articulate contact&quot; as opposed to a discrete means of transmission (Stewart, 1994), but a great deal of work remains to be done in terms of developing the implications for individuals and their language-use. Chapter One explores the stances embraced by rhetorical materialists struggling to describe how language matters. The first chapter fields a series of critiques that essentially argue that a &quot;grounding logic&quot; is needed to organize our understanding of the processes of linguistic sense making. Embodied-embedded cognition serves as that &quot;guiding logic.&quot; Chapter Two explores Embodied-embedded cognition, a counter-perspective to cognitivism - the approach that positions sense-making in a dualistic environment where the sense-able stuff of the &quot;real world&quot; and the sense-maker considering that world are different. Embodied-embedded cognition suggests an &quot;enactive&quot; view of worlding that recruits that attitudes and actions of the sense-maker in determining what ultimately becomes real. Chapter Three ties these two conversations together through the use of metaphor, arguing that metaphors make sense. Metaphors can be looked at metaphorically, as a form of &quot;grasping&quot; at the world that is remarkably creative as well as abundant. This perspective on metaphors vindicates the stances of embodied embedded thinkers and rhetorical materialists alike that argue that language matters. 
Chapters Four and Five speculate on some implications for public speaking pedagogy and ethics. Teaching language as a form of &quot;grasping&quot; changes fundamentally the kind of practice that is necessary to improve. Likewise, noting that the language that we employ has a literal effect on perception transforms the ethical implications of our speaking. Chapter Five concludes by suggesting a logic of non-violence as a practical and productive response to the ethical demands placed on symbol-users.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick&apos;s disease, and corticobasal degeneration, the deposition of fibrils composed of misfolded tau protein is observed. Recent evidence suggests that tau fibrils transfer between cells and spread throughout the brain, underscoring the significance of fibril propagation. Six tau isoforms exist in the adult human brain that can be grouped into 4-repeat (4R) tau and 3-repeat (3R) tau based on the presence or absence of the second of four microtubule binding repeats. We demonstrate in vitro that seeded fibril growth, a prerequisite for the spreading of the tau pathology, is crucially dependent on the isoform composition of individual seeds. Seeds of 3R tau and 3R/4R tau recruit both types of isoforms. Seeds of 4R tau recruit 4R tau, but not 3R tau, establishing an asymmetric barrier. Conformational templating of 4R tau onto 3R tau seeds eliminates this barrier, giving rise to a new type of tau fibril. Tau fibrils formed in vitro routinely utilize polyanionic molecules as cofactors to stimulate nucleation. A broad set of negatively charged cofactors, including nucleic acids, polypeptides, and glycosaminoglycans were applied to induce fibril assembly. Utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we found that the core structure of the fibril is conserved, regardless of cofactor used. Additionally, we assessed whether a cofactor provides a role in tau aggregation beyond inducing the initial nucleation events, and observed that the presence of a cofactor is needed for fibril propagation to be sustained. The cofactor-fibril interaction was investigated, revealing that cofactors are bound to the fibril and that the basis of the interaction is electrostatic. Cofactor binding is dynamic, as introduction of an alternative cofactor was shown to result in exchange with the bound cofactor. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a tool used for the detection of dilute concentrations of prion fibrils. We have successfully applied this concept towards the amplification of tau fibrils for the first time and demonstrated that fibrils can be amplified, even when diluted by several orders of magnitude. These findings provide basic mechanistic insights into the seeding, propagation, and diversification of tau fibrils. Importantly, we demonstrate that cofactors are not only of consequence for inducing nucleation events, but decorate the fibril and provide a critical role in fibril propagation</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study investigates the formative experiences that nurture ecological habits of mind in youth. The study builds on the ecological habits of mind defined by Moroye and Ingman: caring, a sense of interconnectedness, and ecological integrity. A combination of methods was used in this study: in-depth phenomenologically based interviewing, and educational criticism and connoisseurship. Data collection included two interviews each with five teenagers, one interview each with the teens&apos; mothers, photographing of artifacts, and a focus group with six additional teenagers. Observations and interpretations were filtered through ecological and aesthetic lenses. 
Several key findings emerged. First, it is proposed that three qualities of ecological mindedness be added to those already defined: imagination, active engagement, and self-efficacy. Second, a review of the data revealed that the values of ecologically minded teens include relationship, commitment, and growth. Third, formative influences on the teenagers included experiences in nature (including place, play, and aesthetic experiences), experiences with animals, adult mentorship, community, peer and sibling influence, religion, and story. The aesthetic dimensions of learning (connections, risk-taking, imagination, sensory experiences, perceptivity, and active engagement) were all found to be present in the experiences of the teens; it is proposed that crafting nature-oriented learning experiences with these dimensions in mind helps to nurture ecological mindedness. This study has implications for environmental and ecological education as well as education in general, including implications for teacher education. The values and experiences of the teens help inform the recommendations that educators provide opportunities for natural aesthetic experiences as well as ecological mentoring.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study presents a curriculum history of theological field education at Denver&apos;s Roman Catholic seminary, St. John Vianney. The study utilizes archival material and the historical method to construct an educational historiography of the evolution and development of theological field curricula from 1910-2010. The research questions focus on two areas: the role of the Catholic Church in shaping seminary curricula and the adaptation and application of these Church guidelines by practitioners in the local context. The study utilizes the conceptual tools of Kelly Ritter (2009) to analyze the findings in the light of socio-historical forces which shape curricula. According to Ritter&apos;s conceptualization, socio-historical processes have a greater impact on curricula than “theoretical research-based arguments” (p. 19). The role of the Church in providing prescriptive guidelines for curricula in Catholic seminaries and the application and adaption of these prescriptions in the local context“opens the possibility of generating new conceptual frameworks” and “adds an important dimension to curriculum history” (Kliebard, 1992, p. xiii).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation examines African-American Islamic culture from 1920 through 1959, a period I label the &quot;African-American Islamic Renaissance&quot; (AAIR). The AAIR is characterized by a significant increase in interest in Islam, extreme diversity in views about Islam, and the absence of a single organization dominating African-American Islamic culture for a significant amount of time. Previous works dealing with African-American Islam in this period have failed to fully recognize these features, particularly the last of these. As a result, explanations for the rise of the Nation of Islam (NOI) have not satisfactorily explained why it was only the NOI--and not other Islamic groups that were more popular than the NOI up until the mid-1950s--that became a &quot;mass movement,&quot; gaining the allegiance of tens of thousands of African Americans. There has been some tendency, for instance, to assume that the NOI was the most popular African-American Islamic group by the early 1950s, a notion that is probably an inference drawn from two other popular but inaccurate assumptions: that the NOI&apos;s rise was due primarily to its radical racialized doctrines and its charismatic leaders, particularly Malcolm X, who became a popular minister for the group in the early 1950s. I argue, however, that the NOI was in fact not the most popular African-American Islamic group until at least 1955, and even as late as 1959 its official membership numbers were not particularly large by AAIR standards. Also, its doctrines were not especially unique in the AAIR, nor was its having extremely charismatic leaders. I contend that the success of the NOI in the mid-to-late 1950s was the result of three levels of changes at the time: internal, external in the AAIR community, and external in the broader U.S, culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The physical structure of cellular membranes plays a critical role in lipid and protein sorting. A novel biosensor was developed to probe the influence of curvature on sorting. This biosensor mimics large, two-dimensional membranes in dynamic equilibrium, achieves high spatial resolution between curvature and molecules of interest, and has high sensitivity, enough for single particle detection. The biosensor consists of continuous supported lipid bilayer formed over nanoparticles (40 to 200 nm diameter) deposited on a glass substrate. The nanoparticles determine the extent of curvature. This biosensor is the first to observe large-scale 2-dimensional diffusion of biomolecules on a supported lipid bilayer with small radii of curvature in equilibrium with flat areas of fluid bilayer. This will allow correlation between protein function and the physical shape of a membrane. Fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify spatial sorting of lipids and a protein relevant to cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein (CRP). Two lipids, fluorescein labeled hexadecanoic acid and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, sense curvature by accumulating in areas over nanoparticles, and both are able to laterally exchange with surrounding lipids. Dynamic fluidity of the bilayer was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Lipids directly at sites of curvature recover more slowly than lipids over flat sections. The spatial distribution of CRP was also assessed. Curvature sensing of CRP is isoform dependent where native CRP does not sense curvature and modified CRP does sense curvature. Finally, we show that a ribonucleic acid aptamer will bind specifically to modified CRP and not native CRP, enabling isoform specific studies of CRP to be conducted.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Wind is one of the most popular renewable energy sources and it has the potential to become the biggest energy source in future. Since the wind does not always blow constantly, the output wind power is not constant which may make some problem for the power grid. According to the grid code which is set by independent system operator, ISO, wind turbine generator systems need to follow some standards such as the predetermined acceptable power fluctuations. In order to smooth the output powers, the energy storage system and some power electronics modules are employed. The utilized power electronics modules in the wind turbine system can pursue many different goals, such as maintaining the voltage stability, frequency stability, providing the available and predetermined output active and reactive power. On the other side, the energy storage system can help achieving some of these goals but its main job is to store the extra energy when not needed and release the stored energy when needed. The energy storage system can be designed in different sizes, material and also combination of different energy storage systems (hybrid designs). Combination of power electronics devises and also energy storage system helps the wind turbine systems to smooth the output power according to the provided standards. In addition prediction of wind speed may improve the performance of wind turbine generator systems. In this research study all these three topics are studied and the obtained results are written in 10 papers which 7 of them are published and three of them are under process.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The maintenance of network connectivity is essential for effective and efficient mobile team operations. Achieving robust mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) connectivity requires a capable link maintenance mechanism especially if the network experiences expected intermittent connectivity due to a hostile environment. One applicable example of such network scenarios is multi-robot exploration for urban search and rescue (USAR). With the proliferation of these robotic networks, communication problems such as the link maintenance problem are subject to be raised quickly. Although various routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks have been proposed, they solve the problems of message routing and link maintenance separately, resulting in additional overhead costs and long latency in network communication. Traditional routing protocols discover existing links, connect these links, find the best path and minimize the path cost. The limitation of previous routing protocols motivates us to develop a new concept of routing mechanism for a robotic network. This routing mechanism is named Meta-Routing. Meta-Routing expands current routing protocols to include not only the normal routing of packets, but also the maintenance of links in mobile agent scenarios. Thus, Meta-Routing minimizes the communication path cost and the overhead cost, the latter of which results from discovering a route, repairing a link or establishing a new communication path between nodes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>With the advent of globalization and technological development, English has become a necessary tool of international communication in many areas such as education, business, politics, commerce, science, and technology throughout the world. Also, English has become the most widely taught foreign language in the world (Kachru &amp;Nelson, 1996). Moreover, the issue of successful implementation of the English language curriculum has been the focus of a number of studies. In the case of Libya, however, little research has been conducted on teachers&apos; perceptions of the new English language curriculum in Libyan high schools. Thus, teachers&apos; voices have not been examined or heard regarding this issue in the TEFL field. This study was conducted in a region of Libya called Tarhuna, southeast of the capital Tripoli, where there has been no study with the scale and scope of this research.  The study showed that there were differences between the degrees of CLT principles practice. The percentage of CLT principles practice was 75.4%, with an average mean score of 3.77. Results also showed a number of factors that are considered as major concerns by the participants. These factors included teacher&apos;s limited time for teaching CLT materials, insufficient funding, students&apos; low English proficiency, teachers&apos; lack of training in CLT, few opportunities for in-service training in CLT, large classes, lack of support from colleagues and administrators, a focus on rote memorization in teaching and learning, students&apos; resistance to a learner-centered classroom, students&apos; lack of motivation for developing communicative competence, and students&apos; resistance to class participation. The mismatch between the realities of the classroom, student resistance, and the principles and goals of the new curriculum created a significant challenge for teachers. The data indicate that there is a gap between what is expected in the new curriculum and what is actually being done in classrooms. 
Therefore, I believe the findings of this study provide invaluable information that can be used for the revision and improvement of the English language curriculum in Libyan high schools. The study also sheds some light on the strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum, reveals some of the obstacles and barriers that teachers encounter in implementing the curriculum, and provides recommendations to overcome these barriers where they exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate the implementation process of the new English language curriculum in Libyan high schools by examining teachers&apos; perceptions of the curriculum and how it is taught and reflected in their classroom practices.</dc:description>

      A collection of poems with critical preface. The author expresses concern for responsibilities and obligations resulting from utterance and offers a means of reading poetry in light of such concerns. Lyric theory and the legacy of Language poetry with regards to the lyric are loci in a discussion of contemporary poetics. It analyzes the work of poets Tomaz Salamun and Lyn Hejinian, in relation to theorists Theodor Adorno and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, to articulate a poetics specific to the poems in the collection. The poetics is described via the literary and anthropological uses of metaphor, which are employed to unify text, writer, and reader. The phenomenology of ritual and ritual theory address these contingents to conclude the preface. The collection of poems is divided into three sections, each a distinct, interrelated collection of poetic modes.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Explicit Finite Element Modeling of the Human Lumbar Spine</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Validated finite element (FE) models of the functional spinal unit (FSU) and lumbar spine are essential in design-phase device development and in assessing the mechanics associated with normal spine function and degenerative disc disease (DDD), as well as the impact of fusion and total disc replacement (TDR). Although experimental data from fully intact specimens can be used for model calibration and validation, the contributions from the individual structures (disc, facets, and ligaments) may be inappropriately distributed. Hence, creation of decompression conditions or device implantations that require structure removal may not have the proper resulting mechanics. An explicit FE formulation may be advantageous compared to standard analysis due to efficiency in handling complex, changing contact conditions and the ability to evaluate either rigid or deformable body contact. Also, probabilistic studies based on these deterministic FE formulations are of great interest currently as model input parameters (such as properties of nucleus, annulus, ligament stiffness and facet material and geometric orientation) have been characterized experimentally, but contain substantial variability. The use of these FE formulations is not only valuable from an intact spine point of view, but also relevant in understanding and improving the design outcome of procedures like the total disc replacement (TDR). It has been shown that clinical outcome and the incidence of adjacent level disease is linked to the range of motion achieved by the introduction of these disc replacement devices like the ProDisc-L (Synthes Spine, West Chester, PA). Placement of the spherical center of the device as close as possible to the anatomical axis of rotation of the segment is essential in achieving optimal performance.
      Accordingly, an explicit FE model of the lumbosacral spine and FSU&apos;s L2-L3 and L4-L5 using subject-specific in vitro data was developed using sequential transection of each structure. In addition, the objective of this dissertation was to develop a computationally efficient, probabilistic explicit FE model of the lumbar spine, to evaluate spine mechanics for the FSU&apos;s L2-L3 and L4-L5. This probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the capability of efficient probabilistic analyses to predict performance incorporating disc and ligament material variability as well as geometric variability of the facet joint. A well calibrated deterministic and probabilistic model can be used as an excellent computational tool to predict the behavior of the spine with implants like the ProDisc-L. This dissertation also investigates the effect of altering the position of the Prodisc-L implanted in a FE model on ROM during flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Specifically, ROM, bone impingement, implant impingement, and facet forces were evaluated with varying anterior-posterior and medial-lateral placement of the TDR implant.
      The uniqueness of this work is the method developed to tune the individual structures in calibrating the FE model using sequential sectioning. This strong calibration against subject-specific in vitro data developed confidence in the predictive power of this FE model. For an applied torque, the rotational root mean squared error between the model predictions and the experimental results were within 0.15deg averaged during flexion and extension. The probabilistic analysis compared some of the advanced reliability and probabilistic techniques with the Monte Carlo simulation which is considered the gold standard. The efficient methods accurately estimated the results from Monte Carlo simulation in approximately 5% of computational time. This study on the implanted spine performed on four different spine models showed the importance of using FE techniques as a pre-op templating tool in decision making process for spinal procedures.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Latino Family Involvement: An Exploratory Study of Latina Mother-Daughter Relationships and their Effects on Educational Attainment and Resiliency</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Latino family involvement is an important issue in the field of education. Effective strategies to promote family involvement in the Latino community are vital for the educational attainment of Latino students and emotional wellbeing of Latino families. This study used focus groups, in-depth interviews, and observations to examine Latino family involvement and the relationships and communication patterns between Latina mothers and daughters. The Latina mother-daughter relationship was studied in an effort to gain a better understanding of how this relationship affects a Latina daughter&apos;s educational attainment and sense of resiliency. Results indicated that a positive relationship between a Latina mother and daughter can increase a Latina daughter&apos;s level of educational attainment and sense of resiliency. Additionally, a Latina daughter&apos;s level of self-motivation can affect her level of educational attainment as well. Cultural narratives were found to be a common type of communication pattern used between Latina mothers and daughters. They were used to teach cultural values, life lessons, and experiential learning. By improving family involvement efforts within the Latino culture, Latino students will likely see drastic improvements in their overall levels of educational attainment and emotional wellbeing in schools. Implications for Latino students and families, schools that work with Latino families, and educational policy are also discussed.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Representations of the Care of the Soul in Early Christian Texts</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Michel Foucault argues that modern scholars have inaccurately conceptualized ancient Greco-Roman philosophies as the pursuit of abstract knowledge. He proposes instead conceiving of these philosophies more broadly as sets of practices that focused on &amp;ldquo;the care of the self/soul.&amp;rdquo; Such care involved exercises (&amp;ldquo;technologies of the self&amp;rdquo;) effecting both identity formation and spiritual transformation. It is possible to re-conceptualize the history of the early Christianities in these terms as well, particularly in examining the discourses circulating in the second and third centuries of the Common Era. Juxtaposition and close reading of texts from this period reveal that competing visions of the care of the soul informed by Stoic ideals were circulating among Christians. Specifically, these conflicting perspectives revolved around, on one hand, a dominant, &amp;ldquo;proto-orthodox&amp;rdquo; discourse glorifying martyrdom and, on the other, disruptions to this discourse by those misleadingly subsumed under the umbrella term, &amp;ldquo;Gnostic.&amp;rdquo; Chapter one explores the value of applying Foucault&apos;s framework to the history of the early Christianities. Chapter two explains the way in which martyrdom functions as care of the soul, or therapy of the emotions, in texts ascribed to Clement, Ignatius, and Polycarp. Chapter three demonstrates the way other early Christian texts disrupt this discourse of a &amp;ldquo;suffering self&amp;rdquo; while simultaneously laying out other views of self-care. Specific texts for examination include two texts from Nag Hammadi--&lt;italic&gt;Apocalypse of Peter&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Testimony of Truth&lt;/italic&gt;, two fragments preserved by Clement of Alexandria--one attributed to Basilides and one to Valentinus, and the &lt;italic&gt;Gospel of Judas&lt;/italic&gt;. Chapter four discusses how Mary Magdalene and Perpetua are represented in terms of the care of the soul in, respectively, the &lt;italic&gt;Gospel of Mary&lt;/italic&gt; and the &lt;italic&gt;Passion of Perpetua and Felicity&lt;/italic&gt; and what is at stake for women&apos;s leadership roles in each of these portrayals. Viewing the early debates in this way--as conflicts regarding issues of self-identity and spiritual development--rather than as debates about knowledge per se (doctrines defined in essentialist terms) provides a means of moving beyond the simplistic characterization of the richly diverse groups in this period as either merely &amp;ldquo;proto-orthodox&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;heretical.&amp;rdquo;

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) The Hybrid Spirit Animating Chinese Pentecostals in Malaysia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation interrogates the assertion in postcolonial scholarship, especially from the work of Homi Bhabha that the construction and performance of hybrid identities act as a form of resistance for marginalized communities against structures of oppression. While this study supports this assertion, it also critiques how hybridity fails to address issues of unequal power relations. This has led to an uncritical use of hybridity that reproduces the very idea of static identity which its proponents claim to transcend. 
      Through qualitative study of Chinese members of a Pentecostal church in Malaysia, this study argues that church members engage in &quot;unequal belonging&quot; where they privilege certain elements of their identities over others. In concert with Pierre Bourdieu&apos;s conceptions of habitus, field, and capital, unequal belonging highlights how hybridity fails to capture the intersecting and competing loyalties, strategies, and complexities of identity formation on a contextual level. Unequal belonging challenges postcolonial scholars to locate the subtle workings of power and privilege that manifest even among marginalized communities. 
      The study first situates the Chinese through an analysis of the historical legacy of British colonialism that has structured the country&apos;s current socio-political configuration along bounded categories of identification. The habitus constrains church members to accept certain Chinese ethnic markers as &quot;givens.&quot; Although they face continuous marginalization, interviewee data demonstrates that church members negotiate their Chineseness and construct a &quot;Modern Chinese&quot; ethnic identity as a strategic move away from Chinese stereotypes. Moreover, conversion to Christianity affords church members access to cultural capital. Yet, it is limited and unequal capital. In particular, the &quot;Chinese Chinese,&quot; who church members have demarcated as backward and traditional, are unable to gain access to this capital because they lack fluency in English and knowledge in modern, westernized worldviews.
      Unequal belonging nuances monolithic conceptions of hybridity. It demonstrates how church members&apos; privilege of Christianity over Chineseness exposes the complex processes of power and privilege that makes westernized-English-speaking Chinese Christians culturally &quot;higher&quot; than non-English-speaking, non-Christian, Chinese. This study provides significant contribution to the complex aspect of hybridity where it is both a site of resistance and oppression.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) &quot;Our Father Isaac&quot;: Reading the Sahidic Testament of Isaac in an Egyptian Monastic Context</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation argues that the textual community of fourth or fifth century monastic Egypt read Testament of Isaac as an ascetical regimen in order to transform themselves into children of Isaac. T. Isaac highlights three particular dimensions of Isaac&apos;s character from the remembered tradition of Isaac that would have resonated in the Egyptian monastic context of the textual community - Isaac as priestly authority, Isaac as sacrifice, and Isaac as blind ascetic - to create a model for the new self that the textual community aimed to achieve. Two important ascetic practices in T. Isaac that the textual community was to perform were copying and reading T. Isaac. These two practices functioned as technologies of the self that helped the members of the textual community to transform their present subjectivity into a new self modeled on Isaac in T. Isaac.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Oxide Semiconductors For Organic Opto-electronic Devices</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Development of transparent oxide semiconductors (TOS)  from Earth-abundant materials is of great interest for cost-effective thin film device applications, such as solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), touch-sensitive displays, electronic paper, and transparent thin film transistors. The need of inexpensive or high performance electrode might be even greater for organic photovoltaic (OPV), with the goal to harvest renewable energy with inexpensive, lightweight, and cost competitive materials.  The natural abundance of zinc and the wide bandgap ($sim$3.3 eV) of its oxide make it an ideal candidate. 
      In this dissertation, I have introduced various concepts on the modulations of various surface, interface and bulk opto-electronic properties of ZnO based semiconductor for charge transport, charge selectivity and optimal device performance. I have categorized  transparent semiconductors  into two sub groups depending upon their role in a device. Electrodes, usually 200 to 500 nm thick, optimized for good transparency and transporting the charges to the external circuit. Here, the electrical conductivity in parallel direction to thin film, i.e bulk conductivity is important.  And contacts, usually 5 to 50 nm thick, are optimized in case of solar cells for providing charge selectivity and  asymmetry to manipulate the built in field inside the device for charge separation and collection. Whereas in Organic LEDs (OLEDs),  contacts provide optimum energy level alignment at organic oxide interface for improved charge injections. 
      For an optimal solar cell performance, transparent electrodes are designed with maximum transparency in the region of interest to maximize the light to pass through to the absorber layer for photo-generation, plus they are designed for minimum sheet resistance for efficient charge collection and transport. As such there is need for material with high conductivity and transparency. Doping ZnO with some common elements such as B, Al, Ga, In, Ge, Si, and F result in n-type doping with increase in carriers resulting in  high conductivity electrode, with better or comparable opto-electronic properties compared to current industry-standard indium tin oxide (ITO). Furthermore, improvement in mobility due to improvement on crystallographic structure also provide alternative path for high conductivity ZnO TCOs. 
      Implementing these two aspects, various studies were done on gallium doped zinc oxide (GZO) transparent electrode, a very promising indium free electrode. The dynamics of the superimposed RF and DC power sputtering was utilized to improve the microstructure during the thin films growth, resulting in GZO electrode with conductivity greater than 4000 S/cm and transparency greater than 90 %. Similarly, various studies on research and development of  Indium Zinc Tin Oxide and Indium Zinc Oxide thin films which can be applied to flexible substrates  for next  generation solar cells application is presented. In these new TCO systems, understanding the role of crystallographic structure ranging from poly-crystalline to amorphous phase and the influence on the charge transport and optical transparency as well as important surface passivation and surface charge transport properties. 
      Implementation of these electrode based on ZnO  on opto-electronics devices such as OLED and OPV is complicated due to chemical interaction over time  with the organic layer or with ambient. The problem of inefficient charge collection/injection due to poor understanding of interface and/or bulk property of oxide electrode exists at several  oxide-organic interfaces.  The surface conductivity, the work function, the formation of dipoles and the band-bending at the interfacial sites can positively or negatively impact the device performance. Detailed characterization of the surface composition both before and after various chemicals treatment of various oxide electrode can therefore provide insight into optimization of device performance. Some of the work related to controlling the interfacial chemistry associated with charge transport of transparent electrodes are discussed. Thus, the role of various pre-treatment on poly-crystalline GZO electrode and amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) electrode is compared and contrasted.  From the study, we have found that removal of defects and self passivating defects caused by accumulation of hydroxides in the surface of both poly-crystalline GZO and amorphous IZO, are critical for improving the surface conductivity and charge transport. Further insight on how these insulating and self-passivating defects cause charge accumulation and recombination in an device is discussed. 
      With recent rapid development of bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics  active materials, devices employing ZnO and ZnO based electrode provide air stable and cost-competitive alternatives to traditional inorganic photovoltaics. The organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)  have already been commercialized, thus to follow in the footsteps  of this technology, OPV devices need further improvement in  power conversion efficiency and stable materials resulting in long device lifetimes. Use of low work function metals such as Ca/Al in standard geometry do provide good electrode for electron collection, but serious problems using low work-function metal electrodes originates from the  formation of non-conductive metal oxide due to oxidation resulting in rapid device failure. Hence, using low work-function, air stable, conductive metal oxides such as ZnO  as electrons collecting electrode  and high work-function, air stable metals such as silver  for harvesting holes, has been on the rise. 
      Devices with degenerately doped ZnO functioning as transparent conductive electrode, or  as charge selective layer in a polymer/fullerene based heterojunction, present useful device structures for investigating the functional mechanisms within OPV devices and a possible pathway towards improved air-stable high efficiency devices. Furthermore, analysis of the physical properties of the ZnO layers with varying thickness, crystallographic structure, surface chemistry and grain size deposited via various techniques such as atomic layer deposition, sputtering and solution-processed ZnO  with their respective OPV device performance is discussed. We find similarity and differences in electrode property for good charge injection in OLEDs and good charge collection in OPV devices very insightful in understanding physics behind device failures and successes. In general, self-passivating surface of amorphous TCOs IZO, ZTO and IZTO forms insulating layer that hinders  the charge collection. Similarly, we find modulation of the carrier concentration and the mobility in electron transport layer, namely zinc oxide thin films, very important for optimizing device performance.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Islamic Political Thought: Reviving a Rationalist Tradition</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This work develops the foundations of an Islamic argument for secular, liberal democracy from within the Islamic discursive tradition. First, it challenges the presentation of contemporary Islamic political thought as a unified, continuous development of the classical canon by showing the influence of the now marginalized medieval rationalists in the development of Islamic political thought. The classical rationalist concern with divine justice forced the founders of Sunni orthodoxy to state their epistemologies and their positions on ethical ontology. The orthodox positions, and their related methods of legal-juristic reasoning, are shown to be incapable of accommodating the modern Islamic positions on political representation, slavery, and just war. This leads to the second argument of the work, that the modern Islamic discourse is better understood as a reflection of the central concern with justice and its rationalist epistemology and ethical ontology we find in the writings of classical rationalists. This argument is made by examining the works of three classical rationalists, a theologian, a philosopher, and a historian. Their political positions, shaped by their rationalism and concern with justice, challenged their orthodox contemporaries, and provide substantive critiques of the classical political accommodations, methods of politico-legal reasoning, and hence, of modern Islamist political projects. The final chapter reveals how far the mainstream of Islamic political thought has deviated from the classical discourses, since the 19th century, by adopting the language and ideals of the European Enlightenment. This shift is presented as a triumph of classical rationalism over literalism, whose epistemological foundations and ontological implications have yet to be acknowledged and appreciated.

      The healthcare environment continues to experience rapid changes requiring nursing professionals to update knowledge and technical skills to provide safe patient care. The result is a need for healthcare facilities to find unique, evidence-based teaching methods to support learning. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and perceived effectiveness of two teaching strategies. Nurses participating in the study were randomized to either a high fidelity simulation experience or an online learning module to complete continuing education about a hypoglycemic protocol. After taking a pre-test, participants completed a learning session and then took the first post-test. Approximately four weeks later, a second post-test was completed that included questions about the application of the protocol in clinical practice. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.
      There were no significant differences between the learning strategy groups related to demographic variables, mean test scores, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, or perceived effectiveness of the learning strategy. Both groups showed a significant amount of knowledge gain (p = 0.00) and both groups lost knowledge after the learning sessions with the online group, demonstrating a statistically significant loss (p = 0.027). Qualitative analysis of responses to open-ended questions identified three themes:hands-on learning is helpful (simulation group), online learning is effective (online group), and education is applied in practice (both groups).

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Eruv</dc:title>
  <dc:description>Eruv is a collection of poems exploring the interstices between the Judaic concept of Eruvin and the poetic traditions of dictation, field and personist poetics. The poems that represent the body of this work are explorations of the ways in which poetry empties and fills a space, and what might be implied for our shared conceptions of ‘Home’ and ‘Self’ by these tendencies.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Performing the personal within the organizational: Communicating professional identities through Taiwanese commercial airline pilots&apos; personal narratives</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation project explored professionalism and the performance of identities by examining Taiwanese commercial airline pilots&apos; discursive practices in everyday life. The intentions for this project were to not only expand current knowledge of organizational communication from a critical rhetorical perspective, but to further explore the under-appreciated concept of professionalism of organizational members. Theoretically, I traced theoretical analysis in the sociology of professions and further investigated scholarship from identity research in organizational communication studies. This research agenda helped to advance communication-based understandings of the meanings and practices of professional identity as a complement to the sociological conception. I further merged a performance paradigm and critical rhetorical perspective to examine the discursive practices of organizational members and to challenge the bias of traditional textual approaches. Methodologically, I conducted ethnographic interviews with Taiwanese commercial airline pilots in order to understand how they construct their personal, social, and professional identities. Five narrative themes were identified and demonstrated in this project: (1) It takes a lot to become a commercial airline pilot, (2) Being a professional commercial airline pilot is to build up sufficient knowledge, beyond average skill, and correct attitude, (3) Pilots&apos; resistance and dissent toward company management, (4) Popular (re)presentation influences professionalism, (5) Power and fear affect professionalism. Pilots&apos; personal narratives were presented in performative writing and in poetic transcription to make word alive with sounds featuring their meanings. Their personal storytelling created a dialogic space to not only let pilots&apos; voice to be heard but also revealed how identities are created within and against a larger organizational identity. Overall, this project demonstrated the interdisciplinary examination of the meanings, functions, and consequence of discursive practices in everyday professional life. It also critiqued relationships between power, domination, and resistance while reintroducing the roles of the body and materiality in the domain of professionalism, and provides ethical readings of larger and complex organizational cultures. Applying communication-oriented analysis to study professionalism indeed challenged the long time neglected phenomena regarding the power of the symbolic in sociological approaches and raised the awareness of structural, material, and bodily condition of work.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Sense-Making Bodies: Feminist Materiality and Phenomenology in Constructive Body Theologies</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Constructive body theology provides an ethical commitment to and a set of analytical principles for understanding bodily experience. If we insist upon the theological value of embodied experience, how can we give an adequate account of it? Are feminist appeals to the senses useful in developing theological truth claims based in embodied experiences? Feminist theologies which explicitly seek to overcome body/mind dualisms often reinscribe them when they neglect to attend to perception as a critical element of bodily experience.  Phenomenological analyses of perception (such as suggested by Merleau-Ponty) strengthen and refine our conception of embodiment. Grounding constructive theology in experience requires understanding experience as bodily perceptual orientation, as perceptual bodily and cultural acts involved in socially and historically situated contextual meaning-making processes. This shift expands phenomenological concepts such as intentionality and habit, and allows for a comparative investigation of historical and cultural differences in embodied experiences through examples found in sensory anthropology. Body theology, framed as principles, strengthens theological projects (such as those by Carter Heyward and Marcella Althaus-Reid, as well as new constructive possibilities) through opening dialogical avenues of exploration into embodied being in the world.  Body theology principles help us conceive of and address how our bodily experiencing--our feeling, tasting, hearing, imaging, remembering and other sensory knowledge --comes to matter in our lives, especially where oppressive forces viscerally affect embodied life.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Evolution of Melanocortin-2 Receptor Activations: Studies on a Mammal and a Fish</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The structure and function relationship between melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) and ACTH are the most complicated in melanocortin receptor gene family. A comparative study on the activation of human and rainbow trout MC2R will provide a useful model system for understanding how ACTH emerged as the sole ligand for the MC2R of bony vertebrates. This dissertation will discuss how studies utilizing analogs of hACTH(1-24) have revealed two critical amino acid motifs in this ligand (HFRW and KKRRP) which are required for the activation of MC2R. In addition, the KKRRP motif functioned as the unique binding site for MC2R that directly contributes to the ligand selectivity feature, as revealed from studies on an ACTH antagonist which exclusively targets MC2R. Finally, based on our model for the interaction of ACTH and MC2R, the amino acid residues within TM4, EC2, and TM5 domains responsible for ACTH ligand selectivity will be evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis studies.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Addressing Roman Jews: Paul&apos;s View on the Law in the Letter to the Romans</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For many years, Pauline scholars have wrestled with two related questions: (1) how did Paul envision the composition of the audience for his letter to Rome? (2) What did Paul see as the role of the Law in the community of Jesus followers? As to the first question, I contend that Paul wrote to an implied audience composed of non-Judeans who had first converted to Judaism and then acknowledge Jesus as Messiah, or who became Jews at the time of their acceptance of Jesus as Messiah. In either case, they adopted the beliefs and practices of the followers of Jesus within the pracrtices of Judaism. I refer to this audience as non-Judean, Jewish Jesus followers. I support the historical plausibility of this reconstruction of the audience through a review of the history of the Judeans in Rome including the development of the community of Jesus followers in that city. My reconstruction of the audience is demonstrated through my reading of Paul&apos;s rhetoric in Rom and his emphasis throughout the letter on establishing himself as a member of the Jewish in-group.
      Paul&apos;s position on the Law follows from that audience and the purpose for Paul&apos;s writing to Rome. With many others, I read Rom as a letter seeking assistance from Roman Jesus followers for future missionary activities (his collection for the community in Jerusalem and/or his establishment of a missionary presence in Spain). As a petitioner, Paul wrote a conciliatory letter. Writing to an audience of Jewish Jesus followers, Paul carefully sets out his understanding of the relationship among all Jews (Jesus followers or no), his congregations in the East (composed of non-Judean, non-Jewish Jesus followers), and the Law. Paul reiterates in Rom that the provisions of the Sinai covenant distinctive to Jews do not apply to non-Jews. It is through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, as foretold in Scriptures, which themselves constitute part of the Law, that non-Judean, non-Jewish Jesus followers are brought into the family of Abraham and into righteous relations with the God of Israel. The Law therefore remains in force for all Jesus followers.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Chinese Intellectuals and China`s Policy toward Japan</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation aims at integrating two scholarships: state-society relation studies and Chinese foreign policy analysis. I created Two-level Perception Gap Model to analyze different intellectual groups&apos; relations with party-state by confirming Chinese intellectuals play a role in CFP making in general, China&apos;s Japan policy in particular. This model is an alternative approach, instead of conventional wisdom patron-client approach, to explain and analyze the pluralized intellectual-state relations in China. This model first analyzed the role of two intellectual groups, namely think tank scholars and popular nationalist, in China&apos;s Japan policy making, and then based on these analyses it explains the interactional patterns between these two intellectual groups and party-state. I used three case studies, which represented different types of issue, Chinese attitude toward the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Japanese defense policy, the controversy over the Yasukuni Shrine Visit, and the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, to examine this model. 
      First, I examined think tank scholar groups and the extent they influenced &quot;core interest issue and sensitive issue (Issue 1),&quot; Chinese attitude toward the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Japanese defense policy, and their international patterns with party-state. Chapter 3 compares the responses of Chinese officials to the changes in the defense policy of Japan to the analyses from the think tank scholars. As the model assumes, results show that think tank scholars&apos; analyses are consistent with China&apos;s policy position; nevertheless, it is difficult to confirm their analyses have influence on Chinese attitude toward the U.S.-Japan alliance and the Japanese defense policy. Based on the analysis of journal articles, most articles do not provide policy suggestions or simply provide suggestions that do not deviate from the policy. As Gu&apos;s theory of pluralist institutionalism and my hypothesis points out, most think tank scholars are establishment intellectuals so they tend to be self-disciplined. 
      Second, this model provide a new concept &quot;patriotic dilemma&quot; for analyzing the challenge and constraints brought by popular nationalist discourses and public mobilization to Chinese foreign policy decision makers. Chapter 4 investigated the cases study of the controversy over the Yasukuni Shrine Visit, defined as &quot;major/minor interest issue/ sensitive issue (Issue 3),&quot; and the discourses from the popular nationalist, mainly focusing on anti-Japanese activists. The chapter also observes their influence on nationalist public opinions and analyzes how the nationalist public opinions constrain the policy choices among decision makers. Results strongly supported the hypothesis of patriotic dilemma that, although the popular nationalist group and public opinions constrained the policy choices of Chinese decision makers in the short term, they were unable to change the fundamental policy direction. Third, chapter 5 also focuses on anti-Japanese activists and examines the model with the case of the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. The result supported that hypothesis that China&apos;s policy change was not because of the influence from popular nationalist&apos;s discourses or public opinions but because of the change of priority of this issue, from major/minor interest issue to core interest issue. These two chapters also indicate that the patron-client model is unable to describe the popular nationalist. An alternative approach, such as the concept &quot;patriotic dilemma&quot; is needed to describe the relations between the popular nationalist and the government.

      This project attempts to answer the question &quot;What holds the construction of money together?&quot; by asserting that it is money&apos;s religious nature which provides the moral compulsion for people to use, and continue to uphold, money as a socially constructed concept. This project is primarily descriptive and focuses on the religious nature of money by employing a sociological theory of religion in viewing money as a technical concept. This is an interdisciplinary work between religious studies, economics, and sociology and draws heavily from Emile Durkheim&apos;s &apos;The Elementary Forms of Religious Life&apos; as well as work related to heterodox theories of money developed by Geoffrey Ingham, A. Mitchell Innes, and David Graeber.
      Two new concepts are developed: the idea of monetary sacrality and monetary effervescence, both of which serve to recharge the religious saliency of money. By developing the concept of monetary sacrality, this project shows how money acts to interpret our economic relations while also obfuscating complex power dynamics in society, making them seem naturally occurring and unchangeable. The project also shows how our contemporary fractional reserve banking system contributes to money&apos;s collective effervescence and serves to animate economic acting within a monetary network. The project concludes by outlining multiple implications for religious studies, economics, sociology, and central banking.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Towards the Consideration of the U.S. Community College Model to Address the Need for Higher Education  Reforms in Ghana</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      ABSTRACT
      The higher education systems throughout the continent of Africa are undergoing unprecedented challenges and are considered in crisis. African countries, including Ghana, all have in common ties to their colonial legacy whereby they are confronted with weak policies put in place by their colonizers. Having gained their independence, Africans should now take responsibility for the task of reforming their higher education system. To date, nothing substantial has been accomplished, with serious implications for weakening and damaging the structures of the foundation of their educational systems. This qualitative, single case study utilized a postcolonial theory-critical pedagogy framework, providing guidance for coming to grips with the mindset posed by Ghana&apos;s colonial heritage in the postcolonial era, especially in terms of its damaging effects on Ghana&apos;s higher education system. The study explores alternative pathways for secondary school students to transition to tertiary education--a problematic transition that currently hinders open access to all and equality in educational opportunity, resulting in a tremendous pool of discontinued students.  This transitional problem is directly related to Ghana&apos;s crisis in higher education with far reaching consequences. The alternative pathway considered in this study is an adaptation of the U.S. community college model or an integration of its applicable aspects into the current structures of the higher education system already in place. In-depth interviews were conducted with 5 Ghanaian professors teaching at community colleges in the United States, 5 Ghanaian professors teaching at universities in Ghana, and 2 educational consultants from the Ghanaian Ministry of Education. Based on their perspectives of the current state of Ghanaian higher education, analyzed in terms of pedagogy, structure/infrastructure, and curriculum, the participants provided their perceptions of salient aspects of the U.S. community college model that would be applicable to Ghana&apos;s situation, along with other recommendations. Access to all, including equality of educational opportunity, was considered essential, followed by adaptability, affordability, practicality, and quality of curriculum content and delivery. Canada&apos;s successful adaptation of the U.S. model was also discussed. Findings can help guide consideration of alternative pathways to higher education in Ghana and Africa as a whole.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Biophysical Approaches to Human Genetic Disease: ADSL Deficiency as a Model</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Biophysical tools are becoming more useful in approaching human genetic disease.  The pathogenic mechanisms behind many disorders have been attributed to protein loss of function or gain in toxic function.  For example, changes in the protein Adenylosuccinate Lyase (ADSL) lead to ADSL deficiency, a disorder that causes symptoms ranging from epilepsy to expression of autistic features.  Biophysics offers different tools to study intrinsic properties of proteins.  We have applied such tools to study the enzyme kinetics and protein stability of ADSL and two mutations (R426H and R303C) to formulate better hypotheses regarding the pathogenic mechanism.  Enzyme kinetic findings indicate a) non-linear dependences of the activities on the substrate ratios due to competitive binding and b) distinct differences in the behaviors of the different mutations.  Preliminary stability measurements indicate a) there is an intermediate state in the folding pathway  and a fourth state is necessary for modeling,  b) R426H, a mutation that causes severe phenotypes, is less stable, c) there is no evidence of a gain in toxic function for either mutation.  This complete work supports our hypothesis that there are multiple mechanisms of pathogenesis of ADSL deficiency including instability of the functional ADSL tetramer, aggregation of ADSL, or diminution of enzyme activity. The significance of this is that development of an effective therapy may depend upon which mechanism is active in a particular patient.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Mental health literacy of Latina women in the United States for their school-aged children</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Despite known mental health (MH) disparities faced by Latino children relative to children from other minority groups of similar socioeconomic status (SES), little is known about how Latina mothers make MH decisions for their children. The present study examined links between Latina mothers&apos; mental health literacy (MHL), including the recognition of and response to child psychiatric symptoms, and maternal acculturation factors as well as interpersonal violence (IPV) related symptomatology. Participants were 80 Latina mothers from Denver, Colorado and Modesto, California with at least one child between the ages of 8-12 years. Mothers were presented vignettes depicting child internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as interviewed about their help seeking behaviors. Maternal acculturation was not related to identification of disorders, but was related to more symptoms recognized for child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Acculturation predicted use of formal source of care for child internalizing and externalizing disorder. Women demonstrated a preference for informal source of care, with the exception of IPV-related child symptoms, where women demonstrated a preference for formal source of care. IPV-related symptoms did not moderate the relationship between acculturation and MHL. The relationship between maternal acculturation, IPV related symptomatology and their combined effect on MHL for child psychiatric disorders are discussed.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Mental Health Outcomes of First Generation College Students: Is Generational Status Associated with Increased Risk for Depression and Anxiety?</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there were differences in mental health outcomes between first generation college students and non-first generation college students. The sample (n = 6,449) consisted of undergraduate students, aged 18-22, in bachelor&apos;s degree programs, and was drawn from 15 colleges and universities throughout the United States. Acculturative stress was used as a theoretical framework for why first generation college students (pioneers) may screen higher in prevalence and severity of mental health outcomes. The particular mental health outcomes examined in this study were the prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety. The results revealed that pioneers did not screen higher in prevalence or severity of depression or anxiety than non-first generation students (legacy students). However, students who had at least one parent who attended college, but did not graduate (partial legacy students), screened higher for prevalence of anxiety, severity of anxiety, and prevalence of minor depression than legacy students. These results were also significant when partial legacy students were combined with pioneers. The findings suggest that there may be risk factors for depression and anxiety that are unique to partial legacy students. Implications of these findings are that colleges and universities should be aware that partial legacy students may be at risk for mental health problems-a group that has not been previously identified as at risk. Further implications point to the possibility that pioneers who attend college may represent a more resilient group of students. Limitations include the lack of stratification of generational status by year in school, the limitations of the outcome measures, the subjective measure of financial situation, and restricting the sample age range from 18-22. Future research could include measures of resiliency and acculturative stress when examining mental health outcomes by generational status.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) The role of the social environment in non-suicidal self-injury among LGBTQ youth: A mixed methods study</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), such as cutting and burning, is a widespread social problem among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth.  Extant research indicates that this population is more than twice as likely to engage in NSSI than heterosexual and cisgender (non-transgender) youth.  Despite the scope of this social problem, it remains relatively unexamined in the literature.  Research on other risk behaviors among LGBTQ youth indicates that experiencing homophobia and transphobia in key social contexts such as families, schools, and peer relationships contributes to health disparities among this group.  Consequently, the aims of this study were to examine: (1) the relationship between LGBTQ youth&apos;s social environments and their NSSI behavior, and (2) whether/how specific aspects of the social environment contribute to an understanding of NSSI among LGBTQ youth.   
      This study was conducted using an exploratory, sequential mixed methods design with two phases.  The first phase of the study involved analysis of transcripts from interviews conducted with 44 LGBTQ youth recruited from a community-based organization.  In this phase, five qualitative themes were identified: (1) Violence; (2) Misconceptions, Stigma, and Shame; (3) Negotiating LGBTQ Identity; (4) Invisibility and Isolation; and (5) Peer Relationships.  Results from the qualitative phase were used to identify key variables and specify statistical models in the second, quantitative, phase of the study, using secondary data from a survey of 252 LGBTQ youth.  The qualitative phase revealed how LGBTQ youth, themselves, described the role of the social environment in their NSSI behavior, while the quantitative phase was used to determine whether the qualitative findings could be used to predict engagement in NSSI among a larger sample of LGBTQ youth.  The quantitative analyses found that certain social-environmental factors such as experiencing physical abuse at home, feeling unsafe at school, and greater openness about sexual orientation significantly predicted the likelihood of engaging in NSSI among LGBTQ youth.  Furthermore, depression partially mediated the relationships between family physical abuse and NSSI and feeling unsafe at school and NSSI.  The qualitative and quantitative results were compared in the interpretation phase to explore areas of convergence and incongruence.  Overall, this study&apos;s findings indicate that social-environmental factors are salient to understanding NSSI among LGBTQ youth.  The particular social contexts in which LGBTQ youth live significantly influence their engagement in this risk behavior.  These findings can inform the development of culturally relevant NSSI interventions that address the social realities of LGBTQ youth&apos;s lives.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Attentional processes associated with victimization history and posttraumatic symptomatology in women exposed to intimate partner violence</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) puts women at risk for severe and chronic physical and mental health consequences, including elevations in IPV-related psychopathology and increased risk for future victimization.  Previous research has examined attention as one of the key information processing mechanisms associated with elevated psychopathology and risk for victimization; however, the nature of attentional processing in response to IPV-related information in women exposed to IPV is poorly understood.  Therefore, the current study aimed to further understanding of associations between attentional processing, IPV exposure, and related distress using measures of eye movement and subjective interpretations of IPV-related information.  A sample of women exposed to IPV (n = 57) viewed sets of negative, positive, and neutral relationship images for 15 s each while having their eye movements monitored and later provided subjective ratings and interpretations of levels of risk and safety in those images.  We examined associations of outcome measures with proximal victimization experiences and IPV-related psychopathology (i.e., depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and dissociation).  Results indicated a bias to attend to negative relationship images relative to positive and neutral images, though this attention bias fluctuated over time and varied as a function of symptomatology such that depression corresponded with increases in attention to negative images over time and PTSD corresponded with decreases in attention to negative images.  The general attention bias for negative images appeared to be explained by rumination on and/or difficulty disengaging from negative images, which was related to general elevations in psychopathology as well as exposure to revictimization by different perpetrators.  Subjective interpretations and perception of danger cues were related to victimization history and level and type of IPV-related distress.  We replicated these procedures with a sample of undergraduate students without IPV histories or related symptomatology (n = 33) and found that the overall attention bias for negative images was not replicated, despite general similarities in patterns of attention over time.  Results therefore indicated associations between attentional processing and IPV exposure and related symptomatology.  Implications for models of IPV-related psychopathology and attentional processing as well as directions for future study and interventions are discussed.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) The X-ray and Spectropolarimetric View of Mass Loss and Transfer in Massive Binary Stars</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The majority of massive stars are members of binary systems. In order to have a better understanding of their evolutionary pathways, the mass and angular momentum loss from massive binaries needs to be well understood. Self consistent explanations for their behavior need to be valid across many wavelength regimes in order to illuminate key phases of mass loss to completely determine how it affects their evolution. In this dissertation I present the results of X-ray and specropolarimetric studies on one Roche-lobe overflow binary (&amp;beta; Lyr) and two colliding wind binaries (V444 Cyg and WR 140). 
      In &amp;beta; Lyr a repeatable discrepancy between the secondary eclipse in total and polarized light indicates that an accretion hot spot has formed on the edge of the disk in the system. This hot spot may also be the source of the bipolar outflows within the system. The existence of a hot spot and its relationship to bipolar outflows is important in understanding the mass transfer dynamics of Roche-lobe overflow binaries. 
      The absorption of the 2.0 keV spectral fit component in V444 Cyg suggests that the shock has a large opening angle while analysis of the X-ray light curves places the stagnation point farther away from the O star than theoretically expected. Combining this with evidence of polarimetric variability in V444 Cyg&apos;s optical emission lines shows that the effects of radiative inhibition or braking are significant for this close binary and may be important in other colliding wind systems.
      Long term X-ray monitoring of the shock formed by the winds in WR 140 shows conflicting evidence for unexpected intrinsic hard X-ray emission. Spectral analysis shows that the low energy thermal tail is causing the observed higher energy emission. On the other hand, light curve analysis of the absorption feature near periastron passage suggests that there may be intrinsic hard X-ray emission from the system. WR 140&apos;s polarimetric behavior is consistent with the formation of dust near periastron passage, better polarimetric monitoring of the system is needed. 
      The work presented in this dissertation is one small step toward a better understanding of the processes involved in mass loss in binary systems. Continued studies of these three objects, in addition to other important systems, will provide important new constraints on the mass loss structures that influence the future evolution of massive binary systems.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) Celestial Paleontology: The Legacy of Dying Stars</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      In their death throes, stars dole out their atmospheric material to the interstellar medium in dramatic stellar winds and spectacular explosions. The details of this profound metamorphosis, from star to remnant, play a key role in the next generation of star formation as well as the energetic and chemical evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole. Dying stars are thought to be the source of all of the nuclei heavier than iron in the universe, as well as more complex molecules, such as carbon chains, which form the backbone of life as we know it.
      High mass Wolf-Rayet stars are likely progenitors of many types of Supernova, yet  due to observational constraints we lack the most basic information about most of them: rather they are part of binary systems.  This information is key to the determination of rather or not these stars will go supernova, since depending on its nature the companion can either draw mass off the Wolf-Rayet star, effectively quenching the march to explosion, or feed material onto the Wolf-Rayet star, speeding its demise as a supernova.  Models of galactic evolution depend sensitively on the frequency of supernova for several reasons: they inject a great deal of energy into the Interstellar medium, they are the only known producers of nuclei heavier than nickel, and the shock waves that they create can stimulate star formation.  In turn, the energy generated by supernova explosions drives the galactic wind, the heavier elements now present in the Interstellar Medium increase the efficiency of star formation, and the groups of new stars formed in the wake of a shock are thought to lead to the development of spiral arms in galaxies.  In addition, because high mass stars are so short-lived, they can cycle through hundreds of generations in the time it takes one solar-type star&apos;s to evolve.
      Though intermediate mass stars merely fizzle out in comparison, they are pivotal to the evolution of the universe because they make up over 97% of the stars that have had enough time to evolve off the Main Sequence since the Big Bang. These stars produce more than half of the carbon in the universe as well as much of the nitrogen, oxygen, and more complex molecules such as aromatic rings of carbon. This process, often referred to as chemical enrichment, strongly affects the star formation rates and the characteristics of the next generation of stars.
      In this work, we explore the contributions of these two classes of stars to our own galaxy:  we quantify the nature of the chemical enrichment to the Milky Way from a large sample of intermediate mass stars, and determine the binary status of a sample of Wolf-Rayet stars in the Milky Way.

  <dc:title>(1 year embargo) Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Asthma Stability and Severity</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States. Asthma affects about one in fifteen people. It affects children more than adults and blacks more than whites. People with asthma experience attacks of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma can be fatal and the costs for the disease (direct and indirect) are approximated to be tens of billions of dollars each year. 
          There is no cure for asthma. However; for most people if asthma is controlled well they can lead normal, active lives. Therefore asthma controllability is a main factor in clinical practice. In order to control asthma, the disease has to be completely understood. Asthma is very heterogeneous and this makes the exact diagnosis and control procedures difficult. To better evaluate and study asthma, mathematical tools can be very beneficial. 
          In this study we first develop a complete system for lung impedance analysis of laboratory models of asthma. Our designed system is capable of precisely diagnosing the diseased models and predicting the severity of their condition. We also evaluate the treatment progress in mouse models of asthma.  We then study an asthma database of humans including measurements of four related laboratory parameters and cluster patients based on inherent properties of the study variables.  This mathematical approach clustered patients with specific characteristics and segregated the unstable asthmatic patients in a single group. Our method is very promising in predicting the instability of asthma, which is highly correlated with frequent asthma attacks and increased utilization of care.

  <dc:title>(2 year embargo) Resilience through Adversity: A narrative case study of students&apos; experiences of expulsion from school</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Expulsion from school is life changing. This single event can alter the trajectory of a student&apos;s life--for better or for worse. How life changes is unique for each individual student. Risk and protective factors that impact an individual student&apos;s resilience determine the level of positive or negative outcomes experienced as a result of expulsion. Educators have the opportunity to take advantage of this disruption in students&apos; education to improve the trajectory of students&apos; lives. However, without thoughtful intervention from caring educators, this interruption in students&apos; education may have an irreparable destructive impact on students&apos; future. The purpose of this study was to understand the expulsion experience from the point of view of the student in order to represent this critical stakeholder group in future policy and program development, implementation, and decision-making. Students&apos; narratives are a means for members of the educational community to access students&apos; experiences and perceptions in order to understand the impact of expulsion on students&apos; lives. Students&apos; perspectives are presented through thick description in this narrative case study. The experience of these eight students is evidence that expulsion can change students&apos; lives in a positive way. Knowing this, responsible educators must develop interventions for expelled students that channel the positive life-changing potential of this experience. Educators must develop interventions focused on bringing forth protective factors that are documented to increase resilience and to make students less susceptible to the risks inherent in removing them from school. Recommendations for educators and policy-makers are presented to assist educators in preventing expulsion and improving educational and socio-emotional outcomes for expelled students.

  <dc:title>(6 months embargo) The Relationships Between Executive Function and Positive Reappraisal Abilities in Adulthood</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Positive reappraisal, a type of emotion regulation that involves cognitively reframing negative information in a positive light, has been shown to promote resilience in stressed individuals (i.e., it decreases depression and enhances well-being). The ability to use positive reappraisal (PRA) varies widely across individuals, raising the question of which cognitive functions might support this ability. Only a few studies have investigated this question, and they have not yet examined the relationships between PRA and executive functions that involve emotional materials (&quot;valence-specific executive functions;&quot; EF). The first part of the present study examined the relationships between PRA and two types of valence-specific EF theorized to be involved in PRA: inhibition of negative information and working memory for positive information. A community sample of 250 men and women (age 18 to 72 years) completed a PRA task and several valence-specific EF tasks. Results indicated no associations between PRA and valence-specific EF. To take a step further, the second part of the study investigated whether age moderated the relationships between PRA and valence-specific EF. Previous studies have documented decline in cognitive function but well-preserved emotional function in old age. This raises the question of whether the relationships between PRA and valence-specific EF change as a function of age. Regression analyses indicated an interaction between age and inhibition of negative information, such that older adults with better inhibition of negative information demonstrated higher PRA, whereas younger adults with better inhibition of negative information showed lower PRA. These results have important implications for understanding how valence-specific EF supports PRA in adulthood. Potential explanations, methodological and theoretical implications, and future directions are discussed.

  <dc:title>The Influence of Gender and Alcohol Use On Depressive Symptoms Among Men and Women</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study investigated the extent to which gender influences self-reported prototypical and masculine-specific symptoms of depression in men and women and whether or not alcohol mediates this relationship. Secondly, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the Denver Comprehensive Depression Inventory (DCDI), in measuring prototypical and masculine-specific depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical samples of men and women. 
      This paper summarizes the literature on gender differences in depression and the assessment of depression and gender, and outlines the current research on masculine-specific depression. It is argued that current assessment instruments identify prototypical symptoms of depression, as outlined in the DSM-IV-TR, but do not assess for masculine-specific symptoms of depression. Next, this paper outlines the methodology of the study, including participants, procedures, measures and data analyses, followed by the results and a discussion of the findings.

  <dc:title>Trauma-focused Involvement in Psycohotherapy: Relations with Therapeutic Alliance andSymptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</dc:title>
  <dc:description> Childhood trauma is a risk factor for a wide range of psychopathology and other damaging outcomes later in life (Cohen, Mannarino, Murray, &amp; Igleman, 2006; Saunders, 2003). Among the many treatment models developed for maltreated youth and their families, both specific and non-specific therapeutic factors such as developing a trauma narrative (e.g., trauma self-disclosure) and forming a strong therapeutic alliance have been identified as ―active ingredients‖ that contribute to positive treatment outcome (Cohen &amp; Mannarino, 1996a, 1998a; Friedrich, 1990). The current study used data from the Aurora-Adolescent Mood Project, a community based randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioral treatment for adolescents with depression and prior interpersonal trauma experience. This study used the same participants from the Aurora-Adolescent Mood Project to evaluate an observational coding system (Trauma Involvement Rating scale - TIRS) for trauma-focused involvement within therapy sessions. The sample consisted of 29 participants between the ages of 12 and 18 with a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder (Major Depressive Disorder (n = 23), Dysthymic Disorder (n = 2), or Depressive Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (n=4). 142 segments that were flagged as having trauma-focused discussion from 29 cases were evaluated for level of involvement. It was hypothesized that the association between pre-treatment PTSD-Avoidance symptoms and trauma-focused involvement in therapy would be moderated by the therapeutic alliance. Hierarchical regression did not reveal a significant interaction between PTSD-Avoidance symptoms and therapeutic alliance in predicting mean trauma-focused involvement. In order to further explore adolescents&apos; involvement in trauma-focused discussion separate from the therapist contribution, TIRS item one (Does the adolescent initiate discussion or introduce topics related to his or her trauma experience) was examined individually. Using linear regression, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and PTSD-Avoidance symptoms significantly predicted adolescent initiation of trauma-focused discussion. These results indicate that the higher level of symptomatology and distress present at pre-treatment the more frequently adolescents are going to initiate discussion about interpersonal trauma they have experienced. Overall, this study was the first to investigate trauma-focused involvement using an observational coding system with a community sample of depressed adolescents who had experienced interpersonal trauma. Future research should continue to utilize observational coding methods to analyze trauma-focused involvement with a larger sample of youths who have experienced interpersonal trauma.

  <dc:title>Longitudinal Interplay of Dating Anxiety and Romantic Cognitions and Behaviors from Adolescence to Young Adulthood</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Dating is normative in adolescence and young adulthood, but can be disrupted and distressing to individuals experiencing dating anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral theories suggest dating anxiety impacts romantic cognitions and behaviors, and romantic cognitions and behaviors impact dating anxiety. Thus far, investigators have been unable to explore the interplay between dating anxiety and romantic cognitions and behaviors because studies are limited by cross-sectional designs. The present study examined longitudinal associations between two types of dating anxiety (dating interactions and active intentions for dating) and romantic appeal, jealousy, and compliance during conflict. Two hundred adolescents participated in the study, which began in the 10th grade and continued for nearly eight years. Autoregressive latent trajectory models revealed appeal, jealousy and compliance were concurrently associated with dating anxiety from adolescence to young adulthood. These cognitions and behaviors also predicted changes in dating anxiety during adolescence and young adulthood, but not vice versa, with one exception. There was some evidence that anxiety predicts an increase in jealousy over time. The findings suggest cognitive modifications of romantic appeal and jealousy as well as social skills interventions to reduce jealous behavior and submissive compliance during conflict could have ongoing benefits for dating anxious individuals. Bidirectional associations between active intentions anxiety and jealousy also highlight jealousy&apos;s role in maintaining anxiety. This study moves the field toward an ultimate goal of enabling adolescents and young adults with dating anxiety to initiate, develop, and maintain beneficial romantic relationships.

  <dc:title>Mitochondrial Glutathione Transport: Implications for Bcl-2 and Neuronal Survival</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Oxidative stress is a contributing factor to many neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, mitochondria are a key source of oxidative stress due to electron leakage at the level of the electron transport chain. To combat the endogenous production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species mitochondria are equipped with several redox-cycling systems, such as glutathione (GSH). Mitochondrial GSH has been shown to be a critical reservoir of this antioxidant, where selective depletion of mitochondrial GSH can induce apoptosis in several systems. Many studies have intricately linked Bcl-2 to cellular GSH status and it has been previously shown that Bcl-2 is a GSH binding protein. Therefore, we hypothesize that Bcl-2 may play an important role in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport. 
      Here, we show that inhibition of Bcl-2 in primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) induced apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress, selective depletion of the mitochondrial GSH pool, and led to inhibition of mitochondrial GSH transport.  Furthermore, we found that Bcl-2 is an interacting partner with a previously identified mitochondrial GSH transporter, the 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), and this interaction is modulated by GSH. To further support a role for Bcl-2 in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport, we show that Bcl-2 requires OGC for protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and to increase the mitochondrial GSH pool. These data suggest that Bcl-2 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial GSH transport and that the enhancement of the interaction between Bcl-2 and OGC by GSH may increase mitochondrial GSH transport.  
      The mechanisms of mitochondrial GSH transport thus far have only been extensively studied in liver and kidney, where the OGC and the dicarboxylate (DIC) carrier have been identified as inner membrane mitochondrial GSH transporters. Most studies examining mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms in brain have not allowed for the distinction between neuronal and glial cell mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms. Therefore, we employed primary cerebellar astrocytes and primary CGNs as a system to study mitochondrial GSH transport mechanisms and differences between neuronal and glial cells. It was found that cerebellar astrocytes use both the OGC and DIC to transport GSH into mitochondria, while CGNs preferentially use the DIC. In addition, discrete inhibition of one mitochondrial GSH transporter (DIC) using chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown, in CGNs, led to increased susceptibility to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. Overall, this suggests that inhibition of a single mitochondrial GSH transporter is sufficient to predispose neurons to oxidative stress, such as the conditions observed in neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Finally, the consequences of overexpressing a mitochondrial GSH transporter were examined. Stable NSC34 motor neuron- like cell lines were produced which overexpress OGC. The stable OGC cell lines had significantly increased mitochondrial GSH levels and were markedly resistant to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. More importantly, the stable OGC cell lines up-regulated Bcl-2 expression (a protein we have shown previously to interact with OGC) and this phenomenon was due to increased mitochondrial GSH levels. The up-regulation of Bcl-2 was required to sustain increased mitochondrial GSH levels and resistance to oxidative stress. Overall, this study implicates the importance of not only the mitochondrial GSH pool, but mitochondrial GSH transport for neuronal survival. These findings suggest that modulation of 
      mitochondrial GSH transport could be a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

  <dc:title>Fresh Squeezed:The Dilemma of Local Food Production along Colorado&apos;s Front Range Urban Corridor</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Today, the Front Range Urban Corridor of Colorado is one example from the urban/agricultural battlefield. The history of food production and urbanization in this area is similar to many regions throughout the western United States. Originally an extraction based economy, Colorado later became agriculturally/pastorally based, and more recently became a service-based, urban economy. On the Front Range Urban Corridor specifically, the urban core of Denver and Boulder developed with rich agricultural lands toward the northeast to Weld County along the northern border of the state. Though a semi-arid region, this agricultural zone produces a volume and variety of food-based crops due to a vast irrigation network on the rich piedmont soils of the Platte River valley (Whitney 1983, Acevedo and Taylor 2006). Urban development, however, is overtaking agricultural areas as cities grow towards each other and spread out along transportation networks (Acevedo and Taylor 2006). Unfortunately, the same rich, flat, irrigated soil used to grow food is also favored by land developers and home owners. As development and food production are starting to challenge the finite limits of the land, there are choices to make regarding land, development, and local food production. By combining data from the U.S. Agricultural Census with results of an author-driven survey of local producers in Colorado, this project will consider these choices and illuminate the complex web of their interdependence. The principal results display that
      Colorado faces increasing competition for food production and urban development space potentially pressuring local food prices upward and forcing producers to peripheral land or out of food production.

  <dc:title>Faculty Engagement with Learning Outcomes Assessment: A Study of Public Two-Year Colleges in Colorado</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The problem addressed in this study was the assumption that faculty at the postsecondary level in the U. S. are not sufficiently or effectively engaged with student learning outcomes assessment (LOA) activities and/or practices. This issue emerged in two primary ways within the Scholarship of Assessment (SoA) body of literature: (1) as a misalignment of learning outcomes assessment practices between faculty and their institutions, and (2) as a lack of transparency concerning what faculty are, in fact, doing with respect to LOA activities. Two-year colleges reportedly have particular difficulty in discerning whether or not these issues impact institutional efforts to ensure effective assessment practices; thus, this study sought to determine if faculty perceptions about institutional conditions that presumably elicit greater engagement with LOA aligned with academic leaders&apos; perceptions within a community college system.
      A new survey measure was developed and tested to explore faculty and academic leaders&apos; perceptions on three newly established constructs, to examine the relationships between the three constructs, and to solicit faculty perceptions about their own levels of engagement with LOA practices. The new instrument was found to be both reliable and valid within the parameters of this study. Findings also reflected the presence of conditions that reportedly elicit greater faculty engagement, and that increased faculty engagement with LOA practices predicted achievement of effectiveness indicators for both faculty and academic leaders. A gap existed between groups concerning whether or not these conditions increased faculty engagement with LOA practices. Faculty demonstrated they were engaged in LOA practices considered to be effective and achieve institutional indicators for effectiveness, although part-time faculty were considered less engaged than full-time faculty. Gaps existed between faculty and their institutions concerning how to use LOA data to improve teaching and student learning, and how to communicate evidence of student learning to the wider community.

  <dc:title>Attrition in a Telephonic Intervention Program for Depressed, Low-Income Patients in a Primary Care Setting</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Telemental health interventions are currently being implemented in primary care settings in order to reduce the cost of providing treatment and increase access to services of underserved groups. Studies of the efficacy of telemental health interventions have generally demonstrated high rates of attrition. Eysenbach (2005) suggested that the reality of high attrition rates in telemental health studies prompts further investigation into the factors related to attrition. Such research should focus on identifying the characteristics of clients who drop out of treatment and at what points such clients are likely to drop out. The purpose of this study was to identify client characteristics associated with dropout from a telemental health intervention for depressed primary care patients. Clients who dropped out at different time points during the intervention were compared to determine whether they differed demographically or on certain baseline characteristics, including severity of depression, self-efficacy, acculturation, treatment expectancy, and co-morbid mental illness. In addition, differences in attrition rates between therapists were examined to determine whether observable therapist characteristics impacted retention in telemental health treatment. Results suggested that participant age and baseline depression scores, therapist age, and changes in participant depression scores over time were significant predictors of attrition from the intervention. Implications and comparisons of attrition in telemental health and traditional psychotherapy interventions are discussed.

  <dc:title>The Last Citizen--A Response to Rawls&apos;s Challenge on Impairment: A Third Principle of Justice, and Extra-Rational Contribution</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      John Rawls, in Political Liberalism, acknowledges that justice as fairness, as it stands, &quot;may fail&quot; to deliver justice to people with severe cognitive impairment.  He continues, &quot;How deep a fault this is must wait until the case itself can be examined.&quot;   The intent of this work, then, is to revisit Rawls&apos;s justice as fairness in light of intervening decades of disability consciousness and the emergence of competing theoretical constructs pertinent to the lives of people with impairment, specifically to people with an inability to reason or to reason fully, and determine whether new perspectives can expand its scope into a more comprehensive model.  
      A fully democratic theory of justice cannot exclude the &quot;hard cases,&quot; so in addition to Rawls&apos;s two principles of justice, the author will argue that a third principle of justice must be included to assure true democratic outcomes.  The new principle will state: All structures arising from the first two principles must be open to all human beings--fully inclusive--without exception.  The author expects that this third principle will be embraced by the reasonable and rational designers because it is in their self-interest to do so.  The concept of self-interest--that interest, which might sway a person&apos;s choices toward personally favorable outcomes--is seen, by this author, as inclusive of favorable outcomes for all people with whom the designer self-identifies.  Arenas of self-interest expand past the boundaries of an individual&apos;s actual person and past the confines of time, to encompass others, including one&apos;s future self, whose well-being is of such importance to the designer as to define her own well-being.  
      Rawls means to assure a form of empathetic behavior when he constructs the veil of ignorance.  In the original position, because the designer is veiled from all of his individual characteristics, Rawls forces consideration of the circumstances of every possible person the designer could be.  The designer must consider those of all possible ethnicities, cultures, genders, classes, economic brackets, endowments, and other individual characteristics.  Yet, the veil can never hide from the designer the fact that she can reason, and, if the designer were to make choices based on a narrow version of self-interest, the circumstances of people with cognitive impairment would remain unconsidered.  Yet, people actually act within a broader definition of self-interest.  The veiled designer cannot know if impairment affects his child or others with whom he identifies, nor can he know, given the nature of impairment, whether he will become impaired imminently or in the future.  The unpredictable and non-discriminating nature of impairment means that its lack of consideration in the original position will expose participants, who all have impairment in a potential state, to the consequences of policy, which fails to address circumstances that might define anyone&apos;s future.  Within an expanded notion of self-interest, the circumstances of people with severe cognitive and physical impairment will be represented because, among many reasons, it is personally advantageous for participants to do so.  
      The social relevance of people with cognitive impairment, the author will argue, highlights the need for a theoretical restructuring of concepts of contribution and value, beyond rationality, that would lead to a reconceived notion of rights-bearing status and positions of respect.  Can theory redefine personhood in a non-traditional way that can, but need not, include the ability to make moral choices, in order to extend value to previously excluded individuals, who nonetheless benefit society through extra-rational contribution?  The author will explore the contributions and subsequent value to society of people with cognitive impairment (and all impairment, for that matter).  Notions of value should not be confused with ideas of intrinsic human worth.  Acceptance of the latter does not lead individuals seeking community, based on mutual advantage, to court the participation of a non-contributor.  Only social valuing can uproot the entrenched notion of worthlessness inherent in terms like &quot;useless eaters.&quot; 
      For all people, life as a human being involves living inside a vessel, which is subject to entropy, disease, injury and imperfection.  Historically, society has sequestered those who provide reminders of the frailty of the human body and mind, and in so doing has doggedly clung to a chosen, comfortable illusion.  What has been lost in this collective behavior is the opportunity to lead truly authentic lives, to embrace and incorporate the complete human experience.  People with impairment can lead us in claiming our full humanity and in so doing make an invaluable contribution.

  <dc:title>Social Presence and Therapeutic Demands: The Role of Technology in the Therapeutic Alliance</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This research explores whether access to technology mediated resources that expand social presence opportunities during mental health treatment play a role in what therapists report as difficult therapeutic alliance demands. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious mental health problem, characterized by unstable relationships, anger outbursts and impulsive behaviors. People with BPD tend to be high service users and have difficulty remaining in the treatment setting long enough to benefit from treatment services. Treatment studies have found that the therapeutic alliance is a significant contributing factor to successful outcomes; however, the relational and behavioral difficulties inherent among those diagnosed with BPD can make the development and maintenance of a strong therapeutic relationship difficult. As a result, those with BPD are often stigmatized and denied care. To help ensure appropriate access to care and treatment success for this population, those providing treatment for people with BPD need specific tools and techniques for building and managing the therapeutic relationship. One possibility that is gaining popularity in mental health treatments is the use of information and communication technologies as a part of treatment services. However, little is currently known about how the therapeutic alliance is built and maintained through technology mediated communications. To understand the role technology plays in the therapeutic alliance, specifically when there are high demands on the relationship, this research explored how therapists treating persons diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder might use web-based Internet resources specifically targeted for adjunctive use in therapy. In this study, supportive, Internet based treatment resources for a specific form of evidence based BPD treatment, Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT), were incorporated into a DBT Website and presented in various technology based formats, e.g. video, text, or animations, to intentionally vary and expand the opportunities for social presence between the client and therapist.  A concurrent, mixed methods design was used to deepen understanding of what role social presence and web-based resources play in the therapeutic relationship.  The study used a parallel process in which therapeutic alliance, therapist burnout and client outcomes were measured before and after the implementation of the DBT website, using validated measurement tools.  At the same time, therapist and client reports were gathered through qualitative techniques during and after the experimental period.  Results indicate that when different opportunities for social presence were available, therapists increased their communication with clients and did not rely solely on face to face encounters as the basis for maintaining the therapeutic alliance. Opportunities for social presence were reported as positive influences on the therapeutic alliance in the areas of client learning and provision of therapeutic support. In addition, therapists reported a reduction in burnout by having additional therapeutic support options available. The study also found that variations in social presence had a positive impact on client outcomes, as indicated by decrease in symptoms. In addition, there was also a statistically significant difference in the impulse control scale during the intervention period that was not present in the non-intervention group. Implications from this study indicate that variations in social presence and the range of therapeutic tools available for managing therapeutic relationships may result in an improved therapeutic alliance, improved client outcomes and reduced therapist burnout. The exploratory design of this study had several limitations, primarily related to limited ability to link website use directly to client and therapist outcomes. Despite these limitations, this study begins to create a foundation for use of increased opportunities for social presence as a potential support for the treatment alliance.

  <dc:title>Longitudinal Effects of Improving Inter-Parental Relationships in Low-Income Couples: Child Outcomes</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Poverty and economic hardship create tremendous stress for families, and subsequently are risk factors for child psychopathology.  The Fatherhood, Relationship, and Marriage Education (FRAME) program is a 14-hour psychoeducation intervention developed specifically to strengthen the ability of low-income mothers and fathers to reduce conflict, cope with stress, and co-parent effectively, hopefully helping to create more stable and secure environments for children.  The FRAME study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a couples-based intervention in a sample of 301 ethnically diverse low-income cohabiting mothers and fathers who are parenting at least one child together. Couples were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups or to an assessment-only control condition.  The current research evaluated the impact of the intervention program on a range of parenting behaviors and child outcomes across four time points for both mothers and father, and examined relationships between economic strain and parenting, and parenting and symptoms of psychopathology across four time points.  Hierarchical linear modeling was used for primary analyses. FRAME effectiveness results showed significant time by group interactions for Anxious/ Depressed and Thought Problems symptoms, as well as Parent-Child Positive Interaction, indicating improvements for intervention participants as opposed to controls, as well as a time by group by gender interactions indicating that mothers in the intervention groups reported the steepest decline for Anxious/Depressed symptoms and Internalizing Problems symptoms across all four time points.  Economic strain was significantly related to a number of parenting difficulties, and parenting variables were significantly associated with symptoms of psychopathology for all participants across time. Implications for future studies involving interventions with low-income families are discussed.

  <dc:title>Modeling HRTF For Sound Localization in Normal Listeners and Bilateral Cochlear Implant Users</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems and for testing algorithms through simulation that would be difficult or expensive to implement.  This dissertation presents a model that attempts to simulate the sound localization performance of persons using bilateral cochlear implants.  The expectation is that this model could prove to be a useful tool in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies.
      The head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of this model, and in the ideal case, provides the base characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects.  This defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues that are important to sound localization.  By building on the HRTF, a sound source localization model can be constructed.
      This model was first developed to simulate normal hearing persons and validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization.  The model was then further developed to account for the differences in the signal pathway of the cochlear implant  (CI) user due to sound processing effects, and the microphone location versus pinna and ear canal acoustics.  Finally, the localization error calculated from the model for cochlear implant users was compared to published localization data obtained from these hearing impaired patients in order to validate the modified model.
      Results of the normal hearing model correlated closely with localization performance data published in the literature, with localization error of the model only slightly greater than that of normal hearing subjects.  The cochlear implant population has a more broadly distributed range of localization error than that of the normal hearing population, and in addition, the mean error is significantly poorer.  The performance of the cochlear implant model fell within the range of error reported in the research literature for cochlear implant users.  This close correspondence with the published performance data suggests that the model developed in this dissertation provides a reasonably good approximation of sound source localization for normal hearing subject and persons with bilateral cochlear implants.

  <dc:title>Needs Assessment for Animal-Assisted Interventions: Factors Influencing Implementation of Dogs as Judiciary Aids in Criminal Justice Processes in CPS Cases.</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The study presents findings from a needs assessment exploring the critical features or core elements that bear on professionals regarding the inclusion of dogs as judiciary aides in the investigation and prosecution of child maltreatment cases. Specifically, the objectives of the current needs assessment were examined through the following questions: (1) What are the perceived benefits of implementing programs with dogs as judiciary aids throughout criminal justice? (2) What specific roles do professionals identify for dogs within criminal justice, (3) What are potential barriers to the implementation of dogs as judiciary aids programs, and (4) How are the needs and expectations of agencies considering incorporating dogs similar to or different from those agencies that are currently incorporating dogs.
      The study identified a number of differences in the identified roles, barriers, and important factors reported by survey respondents. Quantitative analysis of responses regarding the role of dogs in the criminal justice setting revealed professionals identified roles for dogs that matched their particular scope of influence. Moreover, qualitative findings provided additional insight into participant&apos;s concerns and convictions and their varying perceptions of factors central to the inclusion of dogs in criminal justice processes for child maltreatment. The study relies heavily on qualitative responses of participants. Implications are discussed with regard to micro and macro levels of social work practice and the field of implementation research.

  <dc:title>Clinicians&apos; Perceptions of the Mental Health of Gay Clients and the Effects of Diversity Competency and Modern Homophobia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Attitudes within the psychological community regarding sexual minorities have evolved over time with a significant history of assigning pathology to lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) clients. Though attitudes have shifted, prejudice has not disappeared. Modern forms of homophobia are less overt and subtler expressions of contempt, disapproval, or discrimination and are rooted in internal conflict. In mental health training programs, LGB clients have historically received little attention, failing to prepare professionals to competently work with this population; encouragingly, this trend is changing. The present study investigated how mental health clinicians assess the level of mental health of gay male clients considering modern homophobia and LGB competency. Specifically, it was hypothesized that less mental health would be assigned to gay clients when compared with heterosexual clients, higher levels of modern homophobia would lead to lower levels of assessed mental health, and LGB competency would moderate both of these associations. Eighty-six mental health trainees and clinicians were randomly assigned a case vignette with either a gay client or a heterosexual client. The vignettes maintained the same symptoms and presenting concerns, yet implied different sexual orientations. Participants completed instruments measuring the mental health of the client, modern homophobia, and diversity competency. Results revealed that the sexual orientation of the client significantly predicted the level of mental health functioning assigned with more health being ascribed to the heterosexual client; however, LGB competency did not moderate this relationship. Modern homophobia did not significantly predict the extent of mental health assigned nor was it moderated by LGB competency. Post-hoc analyses suggested that there might be a difference in the assessment of mental health versus assessment of pathology, with the latter being significantly related to modern homophobia. Implications of the study for practice and training are discussed.

  <dc:title>RADAR Based Collision Avoidance for Unmanned Aircraft Systems</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have become increasingly prevalent and will
      represent an increasing percentage of all aviation. These unmanned aircraft are
      available in a wide range of sizes and capabilities and can be used for a multitude of
      civilian and military applications. However, as the number of UAS increases so does
      the risk of mid-air collisions involving unmanned aircraft. This dissertation aims to
      present one possible solution for addressing the mid-air collision problem in addition
      to increasing the levels of autonomy of UAS beyond waypoint navigation to include
      preemptive sensor-based collision avoidance. The presented research goes beyond the
      current state of the art by demonstrating the feasibility and providing an example of a
      scalable, self-contained, RADAR-based, collision avoidance system. The technology
      described herein can be made suitable for use on a miniature (Maximum Takeoff
      Weight &lt; 10kg) UAS platform. This is of paramount importance as the miniature
      UAS field has the lowest barriers to entry (acquisition and operating costs) and
      consequently represents the most rapidly increasing class of UAS.

  <dc:title>Social Media and Relationship Development</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The present study examined the use of social media to represent romantic relationships among a diverse, national sample (N=831) of Facebook users aged 20-37. Taken together, results from this study indicate that relationship representation via Facebook is associated with various aspects of commitment, including couple identity, prioritization of one&apos;s relationship, and commitment to the future, and was also associated with stability of the relationship over time. Social media relationship representation was also found to be associated with lower levels of sexual infidelity, alternative partner monitoring, and partner&apos;s jealousy, as well as higher levels of perceived social pressure from friends and family for one&apos;s relationship to continue. No gender differences in relationship representation via social media were found among individuals who were currently in relationships, but single men were found to be more likely than single women to display their single status via Facebook. Among single individuals, displaying one&apos;s single status via Facebook was associated with sexual activity with a higher number of sexual partners. These results are consistent with hypotheses based on commitment theory, self-presentation theory, and economic signal theory. Results are discussed in light of commitment theory, and the fact that many social scientists have perceived a recent societal trend toward ambiguity in relationship development processes among emerging adults. The findings lend support to the notion that social media provides individuals and society with the opportunity to adopt clear, public emblems of commitment, thought by many social scientists to be on the decline. The importance of the volitional nature of social media relationship representation is considered, as are the clinical, methodological, and societal implications of the present results. Limitations of this study and the challenges and possibilities of social media in the field of relationship research are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.

  <dc:title>Sound Reason: Radiolab and the Micropolitics of Podcasting</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Over the past 10 years, the practice of podcasting has migrated from the margins of technological conferences to a central role in popular culture. Podcasting is an Internet-based broadcast medium that relies on Real Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds--a peer subscription service--to automatically retrieve and upload content to a portable MP3 player. In light of its growth and popularity, I ask, &quot;what is the podcast&apos;s political potential?&quot; In this project, I argue that the podcast has the potential to serve as an instrument of liberal and neurological reasoning. My project will pursue this line of inquiry by asking three research questions: first, what is the cultural history of the podcast? Second, what are podcasts&apos; political potential? And finally, what are the ethics of critical podcast argumentation? To answer these questions, I will attend to the popular and critically acclaimed podcast, Radiolab. 
      In contrast to technological histories that revolve around the figure of the inventor, I will write a history of the &quot;podcast present.&quot; This method requires attention to the localized moments that become inscribed into podcasting and dictate its use. First, I explore the Duke iPod experiment, which is largely viewed as a watershed moment for podcast pedagogy, enabling podcasting to become educational. Second, I locate the podcast within a historical conjuncture. Additionally, this section theorizes Radiolab acts as a &quot;listening technology&quot; that entrains neurological and liberal sensibilities. Finally, I attend to Radiolab&apos;s &quot;yellow rain&quot; controversy, which problematizes neurological and liberal dispositions by demonstrating how they can court epistemological injustice. On the theoretical level, this project registers the recursive relationship between new media and argumentation to clear a space for new tactics to engage this shifting political terrain. I extend argumentation scholarship by updating traditional argumentative concepts and by inventing new heuristics to accommodate emerging digital practices. This dissertation also intervenes in digital media studies by exploring how political projects and programs recruit new media. On a practical level, this project advocates that podcasts are beneficial instruments that provide citizens with new procedures to adjust their habits and dispositions.

  <dc:title>Acculturation, Marianismo Gender Role, and Ambivalent Sexism in Predicting Depression in Latinas</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study explores acculturation, the Latina gender role of marianismo, and ambivalent sexism in predicting depression in a community sample of Latinas. A review of existing literature regarding these variables reveals that all three constructs can be both risk factors as well as protective factors. Since marianismo and ambivalent sexism may share similar traits, both may be self-protective coping mechanisms by Latinas in the context of a patriarchal environment with structured gender roles and strong gender disparities. One hundred and thirteen adult Latina participants from various ancestries of origin were solicited from the community using an Internet survey tool. Acculturation in this study was measured by the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (BAS); marianismo by the Latina Values Scale-Revised (LVS-R); and ambivalent sexism by the Ambivalent Sexism Scale (ASI). The outcome variable, depression, was measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results showed that Latinas who endorsed higher hostile sexism tended to endorse higher benevolent sexism. Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo tended to endorse higher benevolent sexism. Further, Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo also tended to endorse higher overall ambivalent sexism (the sum of hostile and benevolent sexism). Finally, Latinas who endorsed higher marianismo tended to endorse higher satisfaction, or lower perception of conflicts, with their marianista traits. The correlation between acculturation and marianismo, acculturation and hostile sexism, acculturation and benevolent sexism, as well as marianismo and hostile sexism were all non-significant. Linear regression was conducted to examine whether acculturation, marianismo, hostile sexism and benevolent sexism predicted depression in Latinas. Results indicated a significant model - in particular, marianismo was a significant predictor of depression in Latinas. The other predictors failed to predict depression in Latinas. After controlling for demographic variables, the incremental regression model was non-significant. Despite the model&apos;s overall non-significance, the predictor of age was found to be significant, that is, as age increased, depression tended to decrease. Finally, benevolent sexism was also found to be significant in the incremental regression model, that is, as benevolent sexism increased, depression tended to increase. Marianismo and the other predictors were not found to be significant in the final model. The limitations of the study were discussed, including a small sample size, higher socioeconomic status, as well as the use of an online data collection method. Clinical implications of the study included adding to the knowledge of multicultural competency in the field of psychology, specifically the importance of considering the impact of bicultural acculturation, gender role, clients&apos; perceived satisfaction with their gender role, as well as clients&apos; sexist experiences.

  <dc:title>Spectacle, Sacrifice and the State: The Legacy of European Fascism and the Revival of Martyrdom in the Modern World</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The rise of political martyrdom in the contemporary world is not a new phenomenon but can be traced back to at least the early Twentieth Century with the rise of European Fascist movements. Both they, and the fascist-like movements of today, share a cluster of characteristics that allow for fruitful comparisons of the ways in which martyrdom spectacles are used to communicate with constituent populations, facilitate a culture of violence, perpetuate their revolutionary zeal and demonstrate the characteristics of the ideal citizen. Examining four major movements; Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, the Palestinian Hamas and the modern Iran, this dissertation argues that 1) the use of martyrdom by today&apos;s fascist-like fundamentalists is not unique, but follows a well-known path taken by the earlier fascist movements of the twentieth century; 2) martyrdom spectacles can be used to build support within the population and present a narrative of the ideal citizen; 3) there are different uses of martyrdom spectacles between the regime phase and the movement phase for both fascist and fascist-like movements. By exploring the relationship between martyrdom spectacles and their disciplining nature, we can better understand the logic of contemporary fundamentalist movements and the techniques they used to achieve power and maintain control.

  <dc:title>Depression and Suicide Behavior among College Students: Understanding the Moderator Effects of Self-Esteem and Suicide Resilience</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      As suicide-related incidents on college campuses increase and receive intense media coverage and a growing percentage of college students experience suicide ideation and attempts, there is a desperate need for a more profound understanding of suicidality and its risk and protective factors among college populations. Recent years there has been a growing interest in the buffering effect of resilience on suicidality (Johnson, Wood, Gooding, Taylor, &amp; Tarrier, 2011). This study adds to the suicide literature by exploring the relationship among depression, self-esteem, suicide resilience, and suicidality. Undergraduate students from a large university in the Western United States were asked to assess their depressive symptoms, level of self-esteem, level of suicide resilience, and thoughts and behaviors of suicide. Multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between these variables. The results indicate that depression was a statistically significant predictor of suicide behavior. Results also suggest that high self-esteem and high suicide resilience were buffers that protect college students who experience depression from developing suicide behavior. A three-way interaction of depression, self-esteem, and suicide resilience in predicting suicide behavior was also found to be statistically significant. It suggests that when self-esteem and suicide resilience were both high, the association between depression and suicide behavior was the weakest; when self-esteem and suicide resilience were both low, the association was the strongest. Additional clinical implications, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are addressed.

  <dc:title>Vegetation Response After Invasive Tamarix Spp. Removal in the Riparian Zone and Semi-arid Rangeland Ecosystems</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      ABSTRACT
      	Removal of Tamarix spp. (a.k.a. tamarisk, saltcedar, Athel) invasion is often involved in restoration of Western, riparian habitat; however monitoring of vegetation after removal is often neglected and thus opportunity for adaptive management lost. To address this need, I have conducted three and half years of monitoring vegetation response after invasive Tamarix removal in twenty-five sites on the East and Western Colorado, starting fall 2009. I am also comparing six different methodologies: Point intercept, line transect, nearest neighbor, meter-square quadrats, nested Whittaker plots, and densitometer with the objective of developing monitoring protocols that can be used by scientists and land managers alike. This project is in collaboration with Branson Trinchera Conservation District (BTCD), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). 
      	My intent is that this monitoring project will help to answer the controversial questions about the ecological impact of Tamarix removal, including testing the prediction that removal of Tamarix will increase native cover, and that an increase in the cover and diversity of desirable species will also prevent secondary invasion of introduced and noxious species. Overall, the project will help to better understand the ecological impact of the invasive species on the invaded native habitat and whether or not restoration efforts are valuable.

  <dc:title>A Theological Inquiry Regarding The Practice Of The Eucharist In Cyberspace</dc:title>
  <dc:description>This study looks at the Eucharist in cyberspace, beginning with a case study of a faith community who met with controversy after the group shared the ritual in cyberspace. Based on a qualitative study of the practice and its aftermath, the theoretical analysis includes the nature of the Internet itself and its capacity as a location for
networked communities; its capacity to operate as a communication medium for a religious ritual; and the involvement of active users. The users in this case were members of a religious community interested in preserving their Eucharist theological tradition. The first set of major issues revolves around the process of negotiating the manner in which the practice and the use of technology can be reconfigured to accommodate the innovation. Such reconfiguring involves a level of interaction in which the criteria of a networked community for
Eucharist can be said to exist. Negotiating a use of the Internet should give attention to aesthetic elements that makes for a robust engagement using the medium. The next set of major issues involve evaluating whether or not a Wesleyan/holiness theology of Eucharist, nuanced by a Calvinistic view of Christ’s presence, would be fitting to an online venue. I explored a creative redeployment of these theological traditions in terms of Eucharist in cyberspace being a networked communication of grace characterized by the agency of the user, who joins other participants in a sacramental encounter with Christ. I analyzed what each piece looked like theologically in tandem with a cultural perspective of the Internet and religious practice in cyberspace. I concluded that there was theological warrant for adapting the Eucharist to cyberspace for a legitimate practice that could fulfill the religious and theological purposes sought by a networked community.

  <dc:title>&quot;Wee Women&apos;s Work:&quot; Women and Peacebuilding in Northern Ireland</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      International norms on intrastate conflicts, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, call for women to participate in peace processes in countries emerging from conflict and civil strife, including those divided by identity-based conflict.  However, scholars of post-war recovery in international relations and comparative politics have raised questions about the extent and effect of women&apos;s participation in peace processes, and in politics more generally, in divided societies given underlying social, economic, and political barriers that impeded access to decisive or authoritative political decision-making.  A critical question in the literature on women&apos;s participation in post-conflict reconciliation-related dialogue and joint action relates to whether intra-group &quot;community development&quot; focusing principally on social and economic concerns can contribute to fostering women&apos;s participation in intergroup reconciliation and peacebuilding.  This study explores the experiences of community development in Northern Ireland with the research question: How and under what conditions do women contribute to peacebuilding? The research represents formal interviews with experts in the community and voluntary sector and the women&apos;s sector, informal focus groups, and six months of ethnographic field research based primarily in Belfast. Northern Ireland is a case of protracted social conflict in which the society is still deeply divided, despite successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Women played a significant role in the peace process by forming their own political party--the Northern Ireland Women&apos;s Coalition--and yet are poorly represented in political institutions today. Instead, women dominate the field of community development contributing to peace through capacity-building and other bottom-up practices. Women pursue community development in this case for two broad reasons: first, because it is not political in the formal institutional sense; second, in an environment where women are expected to play traditional roles, community development is interpreted as an extension of these roles allowing women to navigate through the constraints of a gendered public space and employ their roles as women to seek change that does not threaten the political status quo.

  <dc:title>Emotion Processes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescent Depression</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for adolescent depression, recent findings indicate that positive treatment effects are reduced among youth with a history of childhood interpersonal trauma (CIT). The processing of emotionally-difficult content has been previously emphasized in therapeutic models for the treatment of depression, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. The present study evaluated the impact of emotion processes on treatment outcomes in two forms of psychotherapy (CBT and usual care treatment) for adolescent depression. This study observationally coded client emotional involvement, specifically during discussions of trauma-related content, as a potentially critical mechanism of change in proximal (emotion dysregulation) and distal (depressive symptom) treatment outcomes. Findings showed that client emotional involvement can be reliably evaluated, and further parsed into two separate constructs. Overall, results demonstrated limited evidence to support the link between client emotional involvement and treatment outcomes, as no statistically significant associations were found. Methodological and clinical implications are discussed.

  <dc:title>The Journey to Teaching Online: A Case Study of Faculty Preparation And Experiences in Online Teaching</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      When Bill Gates published his book &quot;The Road Ahead&quot; (1995), he summarized the transformative implications of the personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global information super highway.  Almost twenty years later, the tsunami of online programs and the MOOCs (massive online open courses) is impacting the structural integrity of postsecondary institutions and changing the competitive landscape of higher learning at an unprecedented pace.  When Allen and Seaman (2013) asked the question of whether faculty acceptance of online education increased in their Sloan Consortium annual report, only 30.2% of chief academic officers believe their faculty accept the value and legitimacy of online education.  This rate is even lower than the rate recorded in 2004.  With an apparent widening gap between institutional strategy and faculty acceptance, each organization needs to conceptually map its road ahead.  However, only an institution as a whole can decide for itself what kind of change is needed and define what constitutes evidence of lasting change.  This implies a unique transformation of institutional philosophy, culture, strategy, and reward systems for faculty members.  
      Complex adoptive system (CAS) theory (Olson &amp; Eoyang, 2001), suggests that the most powerful organizational transformations occur not at the macro level but rather at the micro level where behaviors and changes began to emerge.  Thus, instead of trying to measure, evaluate, or categorize which faculty member fits into which stage of online faculty development under which framework, this study asked four tenured faculty members to reconstruct their experiences on why they teach online, how they learn to teach online, and what factors influences their journeys to teaching online.  Their narratives painted a landscape of faculty acceptance in institutions and the online learning phenomena in our society.  Ultimately, their stories are really about change.  By studying the &quot;change agents&quot; in a changing organization in a changing industry, this study is not an exercise to identify the best practices.  Rather, this study hopes to inspire new ideas for new ways to conceptually frame the problem facing the faculty, the institution, and the industry in their road ahead in teaching online.  
      The researcher hopes that this study may be used by institution leaders, faculty developers, and other faculty members to: (1) assess the level of progress of their current and future distance learning program, (2) determine how distance learning programs should be established, (3) evaluate faculty development efforts, (4) improve strategies and implementations for institutionalization of their distance education programs, including academic programming and faculty reward structure, and (5) improve online student retention and learning outcomes.

  <dc:title>Thermal and Electrical Transport in Ferromagnetic Metal Thin Films</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      The recent emergence of spin caloritronics has focused considerable attention on the interplay between spin, charge, and temperature gradients in magnetic materials.  A reliable and energy efficient method for generating pure spin currents would signify an important step toward future spin-based nano-electronics that may offer lower power consumption and greater processing capabilities.  To develop new technology using thermoelectric effects in magnetic thin films, it is essential to understand thermal and electrical transport through these films. One possible source of pure spin currents is the so-called spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in which a thermal gradient applied to a ferromagnet is thought to produce a pure spin current detectable by measuring a transverse voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) generated by the inverse spin Hall effect.  However, recent work on spin-dependent transport in thin film nanostructures supported by bulk substrates has underscored the difficulty in understanding thermal gradients in these systems due to uncertainty in the direction of the applied thermal gradient through a substrate with a thermal conductance several orders of magnitude larger than the sample conductance.  These results suggest that early SSE experiments may have been strongly affected by other effects such as the anomalous Nernst effect.  They may also have been affected by thermoelectric effects generated from planar thermal gradients such as the planar Nernst effect which develops a V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; in a film with a planar thermal gradient and magnetization.  
      In this dissertation, I introduce the concepts of thermal conductivity, the Wiedemann-Franz law, and thermoelectric effects including the Seebeck effect, the Peltier effect, and the planar Nernst effect (PNE).  Next, I describe our experimental method for measuring thermal and electrical transport in non magnetic and ferromagnetic metallic thin films using suspended Si-N membrane structures.  Our membrane method reduces the background thermal conductance contribution by 5 orders of magnitude when compared with similar experiments conducted on thin films supported by bulk substrates.  This confinement to the plane of the platform and film ensures a thermal gradient in the x- or y-direction only.  The experiment therefore enables exploration of thermoelectric effects in a  completely 2-D configuration.  Next, I present results of several experiments probing thermal conductivity and the Lorenz number in thin films.  Both the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity of metallic thin films is lower that bulk values from literature.  The deviation of the Lorenz number from the theoretically predicted Sommerfeld value in all films indicates imbalances between the heat and charge currents in the films from scattering or additional thermal conductivity contributions from magnons and phonons.   I also present results from experiments measuring the Seebeck effect or thermopower, and anisotropic magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic thin films.  In these films, the thermopower scales with resistance as predicted by the Mott equation, and the magnetic field dependence of the thermopower results from the same spin-dependent scattering responsible for the AMR.  I present the first results from experiments designed to probe the PNE and related effects such as the SSE in ferromagnetic thin films.   The results share features previously attributed to the SSE such as linear delta T dependence and sign reversal on hot and cold sides of the sample, however, the voltage generated transverse to the applied thermal gradient is always even in applied field due to spin-dependent scattering.  The data display a sin&amp;theta;cos&amp;theta; angular dependence predicted by the PNE rather than the cos&amp;theta; angular dependence expected from the SSE.  In these experiments, we observe no evidence of a thermally generated spin current, and the upper limit on the SSE coefficient in our experiment is 15-30 times smaller than previously reported by experiments conducted using bulk substrates.  Finally, I present first results from experiments designed to measure the Peltier effect in thin films and test the interdependence between the Peltier and Seebeck effects predicted by Onsager reciprocal relations.  These are the first measurements of the Peltier effect and Onsager reciprocity in ferromagnetic thin films near room temperature, and are an important step to confirm the validity of the theoretically predicted Onsager reciprocity in these systems.

  <dc:title>Human Action Recognition Via Fused Kinematic Structure and Surface Representation</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Human action recognition from visual data has remained a challenging problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. This dissertation introduces a new methodology for human action recognition using motion features extracted from kinematic structure, and shape features extracted from surface representation of human
      body. Motion features are used to provide sufficient information about human movement, whereas shape features are used to describe the structure of silhouette. These features are fused at the kernel level  using Multikernel Learning (MKL) technique to enhance the overall performance of human action recognition. In fact, there are advantages in using multiple types of features for human action recognition,  especially, if the features are complementary to each other (e.g. kinematic/motion features and shape features). For instance, challenging problems such as inter-class similarity among actions and performance variation, which cannot be resolved easily by using a single type of feature, can be handled by fusing multiple types of features.
      This dissertation presents a new method for representing the human body surface provided by depth map (3-D) using spherical harmonics representation. The advantage of using the spherical harmonics representation is to represent the whole body surface into a nite series of spherical harmonics coefficients. Furthermore, these series can be used to describe the pose of the body using the phase information encoded inside the coefficients. Another method for detecting/tracking distal limb segments using the kinematic structure is developed. The advantage of using the distal limb segments is to extract discriminative features that can provide sufficient  and compact information to recognize human actions. Our experimental results show that the aforementioned methods for human action description are complementary to each other. Hence, combining both features can enhance the robustness of action recognition. In this context, a framework to fuse multiple features using MKL technique is developed. The experimental results show that this framework is promising in incorporating multiple features in different domain for automated recognition of human actions

  <dc:title>Navigating the Paradox: An Examination of Compliance-gaining and Relational Development in Hostage Incidents</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study sought to examine potential relationships between compliance-gaining strategy use and the outcome of hostage negotiation events. Persuasion has been identified as being a critical yet understudied part of the negotiation process. Utilizing the theory of Speech Acts, this study argued that compliance-gaining strategies play an essential role in the hostage recovery process. Specifically, compliance-gaining strategies allow the negotiator to exercise persuasion during the negotiation process while also building an interaction context that allows the hostage taker to feel as if the negotiator is working with, rather than against, the perpetrator. This type of relationship allows the negotiator to exert a greater degree of influence in the incident. Through analyzing nine hostage incidents, this study was able to identify compliance-gaining tactics that related to the outcome of hostage events. Compliance-gaining tactics that reduce relational distance were related to peaceful outcomes and compliance-gaining tactics that increased relational distance were related to unsuccessful outcomes. This study also found that the use of compliance-gaining tactics was particularly important in the final Resolution stage of hostage incidents. In examining the ways that the parties respond to the use of compliance-gaining techniques, the hostage takers&apos; use of Agreement or Disagreement were discovered to be related to incident outcome. Practical applications for negotiation professionals, disciplinary contributions, and study limitations were also discussed.

  <dc:title>Thinking, with Heidegger, the Religion-Science-Theology Relation</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This work is an attempt to think the essential nature of the interrelationships among religion, science, and theology (RST) out of Heidegger&apos;s engagement with the question of Being. Three primary questions initially motivated this inquiry: First, how are the interrelations (if any) among religion, science, and theology to be understood? Second, is a relation of &quot;dialogue,&quot; in some sense, possible among the three elements of the RST triad? And third, does theology have a rightful place in the public square dominated by the view that science serves as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for rationality and truth? The inquiry interweaves five threads, or lines of inquiry, which are posited as pertinent in the current RST discourse and central to Heidegger&apos;s thought. The first thread consists of the chapter themes: phenomenology, truth, technology, and ethics. The other four threads--comportment toward things, reflection, thinking, and destiny--each &quot;cross-cut,&quot; or traverse, the chapter themes.
      By Heidegger&apos;s lights, each cross-cutting thread harbors a duality: comportment toward things as objectification or non-objectification; reflection as &lt;italic&gt;Reflexion&lt;italic&gt; or &lt;italic&gt;Besinnung&lt;italic&gt; (mindfulness); thinking as calculative or meditative; and destiny as fate or the sending of Being (&lt;italic&gt;Geschick&lt;italic&gt;). Heidegger&apos;s critique of each duality--and the expanded global context suggested here for thinking the RST relation--offer fresh opportunities for reinscribing the customary formulation of theology (i.e., reflection upon religious experience and belief) as a basis for a compelling dialogue among religion, science, and theology today.

  <dc:title>Individual and Family Factors Related to the Reduction of Risk Behavior in Asian Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation study examined the risk and promotive factors that can hinder or help adolescents as they transition into adulthood. Chinese, Japanese and Korean adolescents were surveyed in order to examine the individual and family factors influencing risk behavior in adolescents. Correlation and regression were used to examine the relationship among variables. Findings from the analysis revealed that promotive factors including: autonomy, easy temperament, emotional intelligence, humor, moral development, optimism and physical beauty, and risk factors including: history of physical abuse, history of sexual abuse, domestic violence, favoritism of siblings, parental depression and parent not aware, were found to be predicative in North America, Europe, and Australia are also predictive for East Asian cultures. Implications of these findings for theory, research, policy and social work practice are explored.

  <dc:title>Computational Biomechanical Modeling of the Human Knee During Kneeling</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Total knee replacement benefits patients who suffer from severe knee pain or joint stiffness and other joint related illnesses that limit everyday activities. There has been an increase in the number of procedures performed each year and a need to evaluate the performance of these implants during specialized activities such as kneeling. Most computational studies lack insight into inter-patient variability and the results do not apply to large population. This study developed: (1) three-dimensional explicit finite element (FE) models to investigate natural and implanted knee joint kinematics and bone strain and (2) a platform to enable population-based evaluation by combining statistical model and joint function. Verification of a finite element model confirmed a strong agreement between model predicted and in-vitro kinematics of specimen-specific patellofemoral (PF) joints of four cadaveric knees in simulated kneeling. Three different commonly used PF implants were employed in an additional broader patellar bone strain study to assess the relative performance of these implants during highly demanding activities. This study predicted that the medialized dome design achieves the optimal balance of sufficient congruency between PF articular surfaces while still facilitating sagittal plane tilt to reduce isolated loading of the distal nose of the patella. A combined statistical shape model and FE method were utilized to successfully identify the most important shape characteristics affecting joint performance during kneeling. Scaling in the knee joint has minimal effect on PF joint kinematics but greatly affects joint contact mechanics. Knee soft tissue dimensions alter the kinematics. The patellar bone strain model described here provides a novel platform for further implant performance analyses. The statistical shape-function model is a tool for population based studies to help predict the clinical outcome of joint replacement.

  <dc:title>Therapists&apos; Attitudes Toward Forgiveness: The Influence of Four Conceptualizations on Predicted Likelihood to Assist Clients to Forgive During Treatment</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Research supports the use of forgiveness in psychotherapy; however, little is known about how this process is integrated into treatment. Views on the utility of forgiveness appear to be mixed. Differences in conceptualization appear to exist between interventionists who promote its use and those who argue against it. This study explored the potential relationship between therapists&apos; conceptualization of forgiveness, categorized as either agreeing with popular interventionists or not, and their predicted assistance of client forgiveness, as well as relationships between attitudes toward forgiveness and other potentially related variables Two hundred sixty nine participants recruited from practice-focused graduate training institutions completed a web-based survey. Results indicated there was no significant relationship between therapist conceptualizations and their belief that they will help clients forgive. More positive attitudes toward forgiveness and greater religious commitment were significant predictors of likelihood to assist clients forgive. Attitudes were significantly predicted by religious commitment and dispositional forgiveness, when controlling for likelihood to help clients forgive. Limitations, future directions, and results are discussed in the context of multicultural training, values, and therapeutic decision-making.

  <dc:title>Applying a Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding and Evaluating the Effects of Family Treatment among Sexually Abusive Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Families are frequently identified as a risk for supporting and perpetuating sexually abusive behavior among youth. Traditionally, the field has focused on deficits of families rather than considering them as a resource to promote change. Although emerging literature strongly argues the need to target families in the healing process, treatment initiatives rarely follow suite, and research has failed to comprehensively document the effectiveness of family-inclusive treatment. Knowing there are several gaps in literature, the current study was conducted to investigate the process of engagement in treatment, understand the nuances of family treatment, and to uncover positive outcomes associated with family involvement. An embedded mixed methods design was carried out in collaboration with the Colorado Sex Offender Management Board. Quantitative data were collected from probation files of adjudicated youth (N = 85) in three different Colorado jurisdictions, and qualitative data were collected from approved Colorado treatment providers (N = 19). Rigorous data analyses techniques were employed, including a qualitative Grounded Theory approach using structural, values, and focused coding schemas to analyze qualitative data and logistic regression models to analyze quantitative data. Qualitative results reveled the high level of stress among families and underscored the therapeutic relationship and treatment components as reciprocal provisions of treatment, whereby one is contingent upon the other for ethical service delivery. Quantitative logistic regression models demonstrated that youth with greater family service involvement (measured on a continuous scale composed of constructs of family therapy, multi-family group, family multi-disciplinary team, informed supervision, and family reunification) were three times more likely to successfully complete treatment than those who did not receive any family services. A conceptual model emerged that revealed strategies to move families through the treatment process. Inherent implications suggest that: crisis prevention initiatives are important to avert high levels of family stress; current treatment frameworks should be revised to include family protective factors; critical mechanisms of change should be tested quantitatively; and family services should occur uniformly. Overall, future research steps should detail a manual for how to pragmatically move families through the treatment process, test the effectiveness of that manual, and then disseminate effective methods to the provider community.

  <dc:title>Editorial Collaboration and Control: Laura Riding and the Seizen Press Years</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      With the founding of Seizin Press in 1927, Laura Riding began a new epoch in her career as poet and literary theorist.  Along with her partner, Robert Graves, Riding worked among and with important literary tastemakers of the Modernist era, such as Gertrude Stein, Len Lye and James Reeves.  Riding&apos;s demanding and intense editorial and collaborative style resulted in some unique and fascinating works, such as the bizarrely beautiful &lt;italic&gt;Life of the Dead&lt;/italic&gt; and the egomaniacal &lt;italic&gt;The World and Ourselves&lt;/italic&gt;. Beyond close literary examination of the above works, this study looks at the pressures both within the Seizin Press community and without--such as the demands of new publishing standards on small presses, and the intrusion of the Spanish Civil War. Ultimately, the control Riding exerted on both her own work and the works of those around her reflected more than the hysterical micro-managing of which she and so many other women editors were accused.  Instead, her obsessive desire to control every word written by her collaborators and clients spoke to her radical view of language as not only stable, but the only link with ultimate truth.  Authors, especially poets, became more and more suspect as purveyors of lies in Riding&apos;s point of view.  During her years at the press, Riding&apos;s understanding of the poet&apos;s role in society shifted from one akin to priest into one akin to charlatan.  For Riding scholars, it is especially important that we consider the impact of Riding&apos;s years at Seizin Press in her infamous disavowal of poetry in 1941.  This study therefore works to place in conversation Riding&apos;s years at Seizin with her language theories and, in turn, explore the way such theories defined Riding&apos;s reality through her work at the press.

  <dc:title>Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment: Does Family Systems Therapy Improve Family Functioning and Decrease Drug Use?</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Family systems therapy is a way of working with individuals, couples, families, or a group of people that emphasizes relationships and a person&apos;s/family&apos;s greater &quot;system&quot; as important factors in establishing change and health (Haley, 1976; Minuchin, 1974).  Treating adolescent substance abuse with family systems therapy has been demonstrated in the literature as being an effective method of intervention (Coatsworth, Santisteban, McBride, &amp; Szapocznik, 2001; Kumfer &amp; Alvarado, 2003; Leichtling, Gabriel, Lewis &amp; Vander Ley, 2006; Liddle, 2002; Liddle et al., 2001; Rowe &amp; Liddle, 2003), as the various ecological and epidemiological factors associated with adolescent substance abuse can be addressed effectively with family systems work (Cunningham &amp; Henggler, 1999; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 1979; Liddle et al., 2001; Szapocznik &amp; Williams, 2000).  The dissertation used a sample of 71 families who participated in a family systems therapy intensive outpatient substance abuse program in the greater metro-Denver area from 2006 to mid-2008.  The youth, aged 13-17 years old, tended to be highly involved with substance abuse, were not motivated to change, and were not interested in participating in treatment.  A three-month follow-up survey was evaluated and demonstrated that both youth and parents/guardians found that that family systems therapy was effective in increasing the family&apos;s functioning, decreasing the youth&apos;s substance use, increasing the youth&apos;s school performance, and decreasing the youth&apos;s court involvement.

  <dc:title>Mimicry, Mirroring, Subversion, and Critique: Reading Heterotopia in the Cubicula of the Sacraments</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This dissertation examines the spaces commonly called the Cubicula of the Sacraments, five rooms in the Callistus Catacomb in Rome, in light of Michel Foucault&apos;s concept of heterotopia. I argue that the Christian communities that created the Cubicula constructed their spaces and construed the symbolic worlds they conjured there as a way of mimicking, mirroring, subverting, and critiquing the &quot;other&quot; spaces and cultures that surrounded them. 
      This work takes place along four lines of inquiry. The first of these is space and place, and uses Foucault&apos;s and Henri Lefebvre&apos;s notions of heterotopia to describe the Callistus Catacomb&apos;s location in the Roman landscape--its relationship to other spaces, structures, and ideas. The second is art; the rich decorations in the Cubicula provide opportunity to think about the communities&apos; creative use of new and traditional iconography to construct a uniquely Christian world-view in art. The third is texts. Much of the art in the Cubicula is drawn from or connected to textual sources, and examination of those texts reveals selections and interpretations that tend toward spatial readings and meanings. The fourth is practices; the Cubicula of the Sacraments contain references to practices such as baptism and meals, and served as locations for practices such as funerals and pilgrimage--all serving to underscore and enhance the heterotopian nature of the spaces. 
      Together, the evidence of space and place, art, texts, and practices, when viewed through Foucault&apos;s work, reveal that the Cubicula of the Sacraments were heterotopias, or &quot;other spaces,&quot; within the Roman landscape. These were spaces of contestation, expression, and the formation of communal identity--venues for the construal of Christianity and its place in the world, and meticulously constructed microcosms of the world as they thought it ought to be. 
      This dissertation, then, provides a holistic, theoretically grounded view of catacomb spaces, and demonstrates the usefulness of approaches that combine various types of evidence available in the catacombs to &quot;read&quot; them as wholes. It also illuminates Christian construals of themselves and the Roman Empire in the period before Constantine, shedding light on the development of Christian traditions.

  <dc:title>A Mixed Methods Examination of Structural Bigenderism and the Consequences for Transgender and Gender Variant People</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For years, transgender activists and their allies have spoken out about the oppression that transgender and gender non-conforming people experience in relation to societal systems and institutions, due to policies and practices that do not acknowledge non-binary experiences of gender, that do not recognize that one&apos;s gender may change over time or may not match cultural expectations for gender expression, and that punish and discriminate against trans people (Gilbert, 2009; Lombardi &amp; Davis, 2006; Markman, 2011; Spade, 2006; WWRC, 2010). Scholars have called for human services professionals and researchers to critique the failures of institutions in society (and the people within them) that continue to reproduce oppressive patterns related to gender (Davis, 2008; Markman, 2011; Spade, 2006; Wilchins, 2004). This dissertation examines the topic of structural bigenderism, using a mixed methods analysis of data based on the lives of transgender and gender non-conforming people in two settings of interest to social workers--social welfare settings and higher education.
      This study analyzes secondary data from two community-based projects: a qualitative participatory research project in Colorado of 30 transgender people&apos;s experiences in higher education, and a national survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force of transgender people&apos;s experiences of discrimination across a variety of settings (Grant et al., 2011). Qualitative themes provide detail about problematic institutional practices, interactions with people who embody the power of the institution, and suggestions for improving higher education settings. Quantitative findings (with sample sizes ranging from &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 296 to &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 3,480, depending on the model) indicate a general pattern that transgender people who held multiple marginalized identities were at greatest risk of unequal treatment in social welfare settings, being denied access to or thrown out of homeless shelters, being denied financial aid or scholarships, being denied access to gender-appropriate spaces at school, and being prohibited from changing their student records to reflect their gender. Joint data displays explore the role of intersectionality in transgender people&apos;s experiences in higher education. The study concludes with a discussion of implications for social work practitioners and educators.

  <dc:title>Hope&apos;s Voice: Listening to Urban Youth</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      For several decades, there has been a large gap between the achievement scores of urban youth of color and their white counterparts. This achievement gap persists despite the efforts of educators and policymakers to close it. This descriptive study examined the perceptions of urban youth of color regarding their role in school and the support and barriers they encountered related to academic achievement in school. 
      Duncan-Andrade (2009) compares schooling in underserved communities to growing roses in concrete. He argues that the conditions of life for urban youth of color are in themselves oppositional forces. He writes that hope is required urban youth face such forces. Hope is composed of three parts: goals, pathways, and agency (McDermott, 2002; Snyder, 2003).  
      This study examined the goals, pathways, and agency for urban youth of color and their perception of what schools are doing to support them.  Through the use of focus groups and surveys in two high schools in the Denver metropolitan region of Colorado, students&apos; stories were collected. These groups were facilitated by student leaders from Urban Youth Ambassadors. 
      Major findings in this study include that students identified a greater number of barriers to engagement than they identified sources of support. All three sources of support (teacher/student relationships, family influence, and teacher quality) were also potential barriers to engagement according to the students. School climate and limiting mental models were the other two barriers to engagement. The teacher was central in two of the support and barrier themes: Teacher/Student Relationship Quality (TSRQ) and Teaching Quality (TQ).The teacher&apos;s ability to develop a strong, productive relationship with the students can be the factor that changes a student&apos;s experience and success. The students articulated hope through relationships and displayed evidence of personal resilience toward accomplishing goals. The goal orientation that emerged in this study was more about relationships and the people in student&apos;s lives than it was about academic achievement or the standardized testing.

  <dc:title>Assessment of the Performance of a Resilient Hybrid Political System: The Case of Malaysia</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Countries that come out of the &quot;gray zone&quot; during &quot;third wave democratization,&quot;  as ambiguous as they may seem politically, may not be a manifestation of a failed democratization attempt. Rather, their &quot;hybrid&quot; characteristics, portraying neither a full democracy nor outright authoritarian practices entrenched in the system, may plausibly serve as a panacea to governing, especially in a troubled state.
      Many studies that have depicted the &quot;hybrid&quot; political system have focused more on its conceptualization and typology rather than how this kind of regime actually performs and functions. However, studying this regime type only at its surface does not help us to understand the in-depth nature of a hybrid regime nor its political setup. A thorough assessment is needed for this purpose. Therefore, this case study evaluates the performance of the hybrid political system that is practiced in Malaysia.
      This study assesses the two democratic principles of popular control and political equality, using the assessment framework prepared by the internationally based intergovernmental organization, the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), whose aim is to support sustainable democracy around the world. The method prepared by International IDEA was based on the claim that &quot;democracy is not an all-or-nothing affair&quot; but is a shifting continuum. The IDEA method acknowledges that the democracy practiced in some countries is not perfect and is subject to the country&apos;s historical experiences, demographics, cultures, and realities.
      This study&apos;s results suggest that having partially practiced democratic principles, with support from semi-authoritarian apparatus, produces a political system with both positive and negative components that both facilitate regime transition and democratization as well as reinforce regime incumbency and dampen democratization. This study shows that, ultimately, the interactions between the positive and negative components may produce balancing mechanisms that help to strengthen both the regime&apos;s persistence and the country&apos;s resilience.

  <dc:title>Aging and Technology Perspectives of Web-Based Chronic Disease Self-Management</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Many people suffer from chronic disease; however, older adults are at greatest risk of chronic conditions. Although social workers regularly engage with chronically ill older adults, they are not noticeably involved with the research and development of chronic disease management. As such, with recent movements toward health information technology, the efficacy of technology-based chronic disease management is not well established for older adults. Informed by theories of self-management, human development, and technology design, this research investigated lifespan differences of web-based chronic disease self-management. Using a sequential mixed methods design, a secondary data analysis of a diabetes specific web-based self-management intervention (n=462) was performed, followed by qualitative focus groups with 40 older intervention participants, and then mixed for overall interpretation. Results indicated that social workers must take a leadership role in the evaluation and implementation of web-based self-management for older adults to address identified lifespan differences.

  <dc:title>Rethinking the Adventure Education Experience: An Inquiry of Meanings, Culture and Educational Virtue</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study is an investigation of the adventure education (AE) experience with particular attention to what happens during the AE experience, the meanings participants ascribe to the experience, how personal backgrounds and institutional cultures coalesce in AE, and the significance of the AE experience for schooling. These topics are explored through observing and interviewing participants of adventure education programs under the qualitative framework of educational connoisseurship and criticism. The experiences at the three sites of study--an outdoor challenge course, a wilderness backpacking expedition and a summer adventure program--are described in detail and illustrated through the qualities of the experience (celebratory challenge, novelty, freedom and togetherness, aesthetic vitality, and great experience), cultural coalescence in AE (depicted through cultural rigidity and flexibility), and the participant perceptions of schooling. Findings are inferred through recommendations for AE, including consideration of the qualities of experience, striking a cultural balance in AE, and embodying a shift in thinking regarding the purpose of the AE experience. This study also provokes a reconsideration of contemporary educational paradigms, as the participant perceptions of schooling, when considered alongside the AE experience, provide a fresh perspective of the qualities of educational experience.

  <dc:title>Authenticity in Education: Theory Into Practice</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study investigates the role of authenticity in education. By applying Fred Newmann&apos;s theoretical framework of authentic achievement to a specific, K-12 setting operating in the real world, I examined Newmann&apos;s five facets of authentic education and looked for their practical manifestations. Those facets are higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connectedness to the world beyond the classroom, substantive conversation, and social support for student achievement. Parker Palmer inspired the addition of the criteria of the spiritual/ineffable to the framework, which is also examined in relation to authentic pedagogy. Combined, these qualities are referred to as the authentic education framework (AEF). Qualitative data from The Spring School (pseudonym) on the east coast of the United States has been collected and analyzed through the lens of educational connoisseurship and criticism. This research method permits the researcher to provide thick description, interpretation, and evaluation and to draw on themes presented in the data analysis. Qualitative methods of data collection including interview, observation, and artifact review were corroborated. Because the administration of the school changed during the data analysis phase and no longer operates under the philosophy under which this study occurred, this paper has become an historical narrative.
      	The findings that emerged reveal that the following factors aid in the realization of authentic pedagogy at the elementary-school level: (1) school trust, (2) opportunities for aesthetic transformative experiences, (3) works toward a greater good, and (4) the role of the community. The notions of sincerity, honesty, relevance and wholisitic teaching in the school context were also evident.  Findings also underscore the importance of a well-developed and thoroughly considered school philosophy. This study confirms that the processes of teaching and learning are personal in nature and relative to context and that prescribed curricula and confining pedagogical methods are antithetical to the development of opportunities for authentic teaching and learning.

  <dc:title>Study the Carrier Frequecny Offset (CFO) for wireless OFDM</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Due to high proficiency with high bandwidth efficiency, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been selected for broadband wireless communication systems. Since OFDM can provide large data rates with sufficient robustness to radio channel impairments, and due to its robustness against the multipath delay spread, OFDM has always been a designated technique for broadband wireless communication mobile systems. Nevertheless, OFDM suffers from Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO). CFO has been recognized as a major disadvantage of OFDM. CFO can lead to the frequency mismatch in transmitter and receiver oscillator. Lack of the synchronization of the local oscillator signal (L.OSC), for down conversion in the receiver with the carrier signal contained in the received signal, can cause the performance of OFDM to degrade. In other words, the orthogonality of the OFDM relies on the condition that the transmitter and receiver operate with exactly the same frequency reference. If this is not the case, the perfect orthogonality of the subcarrier will be lost, which can result in CFO. In this research, the source of creating CFO and the major CFO estimation algorithms have been reviewed and discussed in literature. We then proposed some algorithms and techniques for estimating and compensating for the effect of CFO. We showed that our proposed methods have a better performance with low complexity.

  <dc:title>Disrupting Privilege: A High School Curriculum</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Current privilege pedagogy scholarship demonstrates the importance of understanding privilege as an entryway into critical studies and everyday community engagement. Thus, this dissertation argues that privilege must be introduced into education earlier, such as high school. In order to demonstrate ethical possibilities of meeting the need for care, this project integrates social work and critical pedagogy scholarship that explores teaching privilege in the classroom, with culture and communication scholarship. This dissertation connects culture and communication, critical pedagogy, and performance to demonstrate an applied use of communication scholarship in two classroom settings to explore dialogues of privilege through a curriculum titled &quot;Disrupting Privilege.&quot; To do this, this dissertation uses critical pedagogy as a method of teaching &quot;Disrupting Privilege&quot; in the two classrooms and narrative ethnography as a method of analysis of what happened communicatively and performatively in the classrooms. The use of narrative ethnography forefronts student voices to guide the analysis of this dissertation. 
      In &quot;Disrupting Privilege,&quot; an analysis of communication components shows how communication was used to structure and facilitate critical conversations of privilege in the classroom. This structure and facilitation of communication created a space where emotion was brought into the classroom through privilege, pedagogy, and performance. By looking at the communicative and emotional aspects of these two classrooms we see demonstrations of classroom change and transformation. Therefore, this dissertation sets an example of how the use of communication and emotion, as seen in the  &quot;Disrupting Privilege&quot; curriculum, can be used in high school to transform individuals and communities by analyzing what happened in each of these classrooms. The hope is that, through these narratives, student voices and experiences become a way to understand the capacity for high school students to struggle through critical conversations and performances about privilege. Involving high school students more often in these conversations, can teach students to think critically and engage in disrupting systems of power and, in return, potentially transform communities as well as pave the way for deeper, more sophisticated conversations in college.

  <dc:title>Novel functions for neuronal RNA processing bodies in the control of axon terminal growth in Drosophila melanogaster</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      In this thesis we first characterized neuronal functions for HPat/Pat1, a core component of RNA processing bodies or &quot;P bodies&quot;. We show that hpat mutants exhibit a strong synaptic hyperplasia at the developing and acutely stimulated Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The synaptic defects observed in hpat mutants are associated with rearrangement of the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton suggesting that HPat negatively regulates presynaptic microtubule-based growth during NMJ development. Interestingly, we also found that both pre-and postsynaptic HPat expression controlled rapid axon terminal growth in response to acute spaced synaptic stimulation. We also demonstrate that HPat interacts genetically with the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase complex (twin/CCR4) and the miRNA pathway (Argonaute 1) to control bouton formation. We propose that HPat is required to target mRNAs involved in the control of microtubule architecture and synaptic terminal growth for repression, presumably in P bodies, via both general and miRNA-mediated mechanisms. 
             Next, we investigated whether HPat interacts with the Drosophila Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (dFMR1), to regulate neuronal structure in a Drosophila melanogaster fragile X model. First, we demonstrated that HPat interacts biochemically with dFMRP in an RNAse independent manner. Second, we show that HPat genetically interacts with dFmr1 in the Drosophila eye although the phenotype is weak, however we did not see any interaction of hpat and dfmr1 to control synaptic structure at the NMJ. Finally, we screened additional P body components that might have function in FMRP mediated translation regulation. Interestingly, a luciferase-based translational repression tethering assays in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells showed the function of GW182 in FMRP-mediated translation regulation.

  <dc:title>An Assessment of Character and Leadership Development Latent Factor Structures through Confirmatory Factor, Item Response Theory, and Latent Class Analyses</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      This study leveraged the complementary nature of confirmatory factor (CFA), item response theory (IRT), and latent class (LCA) analyses to strengthen the rigor and sophistication of evaluation of two new measures of the Air Force Academy&apos;s &quot;leader of character&quot; definition--the Character Mosaic Virtues (CMV) and the Leadership Mosaic Inventory (LMI).  Special CFA methods involving robust weighted least squares estimation were implemented to analyze the rated responses through linear structural equation modeling.  Most informative at the subscale level, the CFA techniques provided evidence of factorial validity and other desirable psychometric properties in support of previous exploratory results for a nine-factor CMV and a unidimensional LMI.  As an alternative to CFA, IRT&apos;s nonlinear approach and capability of estimating the probability of a response based on the amount of a latent trait was applied to the CMV and LMI data.  Most informative at the item level, individual item difficulty parameters were estimated as the amount of the latent trait required for a cadet to give a particular response to an item and mapped against person ability estimates.  The IRT analyses were extended to explore the underlying dimensions of the CMV and LMI through multidimensional IRT (MIRT)--results supporting the theoretical dimensional structure of the CMV were substantiated while new evidence of a multidimensional LMI structure was concluded.  LCA techniques permitted the inference of classifying mixtures of unobserved cadet subpopulations based on their responses to the CMV and LMI.  The analyses uncovered the meaning and number of underlying subpopulations not evident through the other two traditional factor structure analysis techniques.  The creation of the study&apos;s latent class models complemented the more traditional dimensional approaches of structure assessment with an understanding of the unobserved cadet subpopulations which could lead to future targeted cadet developmental opportunities being applied at organizational levels or groups deficient in certain latent traits.  By exposing more researchers, decision-makers, and other stakeholders to these three advanced psychometric evaluation methods, this study benefited the fields of moral development and leadership development, especially at the nation&apos;s service academies.

  <dc:title>A Pilot Study Exploring the Educational and Social/Emotional Benefits of Web-based Groups for Parents of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders</dc:title>
  <dc:description>
      Abstract
      Research has indicated that parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) experience more feelings of isolation, depression and stress than those of children with other disorders including ADHD and Down Syndrome.  While these feelings are especially elevated in parents living in rural communities who may have limited access to services, they are also present in those living in urban areas but are restricted due to challenges with childcare, transportation, finances and time.  Furthermore, research posits that services for parents of the newly diagnosed or of younger children are abundant while services and education for parents of adolescents are hard to access regardless of location. This study explored the use of technology as a viable option for providing education and emotional support to parents of adolescents with ASDs and may assist in guiding future studies of this nature.  Group sessions were facilitated remotely using video-conference technology and covered the topics of stress reduction, IEP&apos;s, puberty, and the transition to adulthood.  This study employed a mixed methods design that utilized a concurrent triangulation approach. Within this approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently and then compared to determine if there was convergence, differences, or some combination. The quantitative tools included, first, the Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA) which was used to measure any change in stress levels that occurred throughout the treatment.  Pretest/posttest measures were then used to measure knowledge acquisition. The data gathered from these tools were then analyzed using a t test for paired samples. The qualitative phase employed a questionnaire that obtained anecdotal information regarding participants&apos; experiences with and preferences towards parent groups; their feelings of depression, isolation, stress related to parenting a child with ASD; their confidence regarding the topics of stress reduction, IEP&apos;s, puberty, and the transition to adulthood; and their experiences within the web-based group setting. This qualitative information was used to look for themes to begin to understand how parents of adolescents with ASD may benefit from groups provided using Internet technology.

  <dc:description>Drawing on Charles Taylor’s historical analysis in A Secular Age, this dissertation
reveals connections between the process of Euro-Western secularization and its roots in
the universalizing project of Christianity. This work asserts that religion, a term often
identified with Christianity, developed in conjunction with secularization and concludes
that these theoretical constructs influenced international legal principles which
marginalized indigenous cultures that did not conform to its tenets. Not only did
Christianity and the secular arise from the same roots, but both were shaped by
colonialism.This paper provides a detailed overview of the development of international
law as a colonial project that combined theological and secular interpretations of natural
law and the law of nations creating a vehicle for land acquisition and resource extraction
by examining the writings of Francisco de Vitoria, Hugo Grotius and John Locke. In
order to trace the effects of flows of power from religious authority to state authority, this
paper examines the views of Michel Foucault and Talal Asad on power, agency, identity
and freedom through the lens of religion and the secular. This project focuses on the
Native American experience to demonstrate the interface between Christian missionizing,
the imposition of discipline and civilization and the current American legal system that
asserts a separation of church and state.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>THE WEEK is a collection of short stories. These stories engage the
politicized (if not overly political) question of what it means to be human and to be in
relation to other humans in the world. Some of the stories are quite compressed; I
attempt to create effects in these pieces through subtraction, ellipsis, parataxis, and
surprise. Other stories are more sustained, producing voices that address the reader
directly or voices that follow the involutions of a thought, dwelling on minute details
of consciousness; these pieces play with conventional short story elements (character,
plot, rising action, falling action, etc.), although they often “fizzle” or turn sharply to
unsettle reader expectation. I have found that it is very difficult to be human. That
being human is a problem is both the premise and the conclusion of this book.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Early life stress is known to have an enduring impact on individuals’ health
trajectories, however, some show greater resiliency to early life stress than others. The
exploration of candidate genes and gene-environment interactions may be one promising
window on risk versus resilience trajectories. However, prior work involving three
polymorphisms (COMT Val158Met, MAOA-LPR, and 5-HTTLPR) has yielded well
publicized but inconsistently replicated associations with mental health. Part of this
inconsistency may be due to the limited exploration of mechanistic explanations for how
these gene-environment interactions lead to variations in health. Thus, this dissertation
examines gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in predicting basal cortisol at age
eight (assayed from a single blood sample). Data for this project comes from 813 families
participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Early environmental risk is characterized by three well-documented factors (maternal
depression, maternal stress exposure, and child stress exposure) compiled across the
developmentally salient 0-6 year age range. Contrary to expectation, genetic risk was not
related to children’s basal cortisol in middle childhood, and neither were the tested geneenvironment
interactions. Most measures of environmental risk were also unrelated to
children’s cortisol, however maternal stress exposure when the child was 48-61 months
old was related to higher basal cortisol. Analyses and discussion describe patterns of environmental risk exposure across early childhood in an effort to better characterize risk
trajectories in this sample. Although the current findings do not support HPA axis
dysregulation as a mechanism by which gene-environment interactions impact health,
methodological limitations likely contributed to these null findings. Future studies should
continue to explore such mechanistic explanations in order to create effective
interventions for children at high risk for stress related disease.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the last twenty years, researchers, theorists, and clinicians have begun to identify the personal toll on clinicians who work with traumatized clients. Mental health professionals may experience disruptions in their cognitive schema due to their clinical experiences. Clinicians may also struggle with depression, cynicism, alienation from friends and colleagues and an array of psychological and physical symptoms. While researchers have begun to explore how vicarious trauma manifests with clinical staff, there remains a need to identify interventions that are effective in mitigating vicarious trauma, burnout, and intent to leave.
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to investigate the relationship between levels of debriefing interventions and vicarious trauma, burnout, and intent to leave. To that end, a convergent parallel mixed methods design was used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data. The convergent parallel design is a triangulation design where data were collected concurrently using quantitative and qualitative methods. The results of this study addressed whether the debrief intervention is a viable intervention associated with rates of vicarious trauma, intent to leave, and burnout for mental health clinicians who work with children and adolescents with histories of trauma.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>My dissertation is entitled “My Education.” It is a poetic meditation on the nature
of knowledge. The manuscript is a triptych, each section of which corresponds to a
common source of knowledge.
The first chapter is a collection of poems entitled As Seen On TV. The poems
borrow conceptual metaphors and visual gestures from television programs in order to
investigate the values that produced them and norms that are produced by them. The
poems are concerned with mimesis: the troubled relationship between art and life.
Organized as a day spent in front the television, the book opens with the morning news,
and ends with late night reruns and static. These poems are about the passage of time, the
female body, and the violence of its rapid obsolescence.
The second chapter, “Boy Friends,” is an alphabetical primer on romance. The
alphabet contains the units of literacy, of knowledge. It is an organizational method. The
alphabet book is a didactic form; it teaches the order of things. In this work, the speaker
lists the men in her life alphabetically, describing her affairs and thwarted love interests,
beginning with Adam and ending with Zachary. The twenty-six lineated poems are
followed by a prose addendum entitled &quot;Roll Call,&quot; in which the speaker tries to list every
boy she ever met and explain what has become of him since she knew him. Many of the
names from “Boy Friends” recur here, and a sense of narrative develops and acts as a
bridge into the final chapter.
The third section, “Confessional Poetry,” is a collection of prose essays modeled
after the Roman Catholic Sacrament of Penance. In this work, I confess a sin to
correspond to each on the Ten Commandments. This numeric organization (1-10) mirrors
the alphabetical organization (A-Z) of “Boyfriends.” This is a work of spiritual
accounting. In it, I tally the wrongs I have done to see how it all adds up. Unfortunately I
am not very good at math. I do not know the final answer. I do know that each of these
stories is an act of contrition.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>P. sphinx teen is a novel and creative dissertation that can be classified as 
a descent narrative, or katabasis, employing various literary forms–––poems, short prose, essays, 
journal entries, interviews, and illustrations –––to tell one story: the death, from pneumonia, of 
my mother’s 15-year-old sister. Within the narrative, suggestions of origins are made as a way to 
affix the idea of a descent through generations and time. However, those origins are quickly set 
aside allowing the story to branch like a tree–––itself the shape of a simultaneous katabatic and 
anabatic narrative.
The originating story took place in Detroit, Michigan between 1935 and 1939, and is framed by others: Sigmund Freud’s collection of antiquities and its escape from Vienna in late 1938; the making of Charlotte Salomon’s opus Life? or Theatre?; Anais Nin’s simultaneous marriages; Walter Benjamin’s radio program called Enlightenment for Children. Motifs and characters are interchangeable passes for voices both distinct and indistinct. The author, at times, takes the form of an “I” lifting the life of her lineage to view and, with the suspicion of reincarnation, changing place with the main character, Patricia, who is, simultaneously, one and many. In researching the family story in relationship to historical events and figures associated with 
those events, I discovered an irregularity in record keeping that lead me to question whether my 
aunt had, in fact, died from pneumonia or something less natural.  Because the pertinent family 
members were dead, I turned, first, to a medical chart that my grandmother kept as she tended to 
her sick daughter constructing a series of horary astrological charts that were then interpreted by 
four paranormal industrialists with astonishing results.
P. sphinx teen attempts to manifest the lawless nature of grief as a thumbing of one’s nose at 
those who would have it otherwise or who would make of mourning something compact and manageable. 
It is a book of many voices, ghost-driven, and made equally uncanny by human ineptitude, 
wickedness, and grace.

  <dc:description>This manuscript is an effort to determine the world and how we are to each other. It is also an effort to come into meaning. How imagination is part of that. The escape here has to do with the inability to make things mean—it feels like if I try hard enough there can be a resolution via the imagination. But sometimes when we make things they overcome us. It’s difficult to know the appropriate boundary for imagination—at what point it moves from an attempt to decipher the world into a construction of the reality of the world. I can’t ever tell the difference but I continue to try. Some of what went into this manuscript has is the thinking about neuroscience (neurotheology). My interest in perceptions of reality and what can be obtained from a negotiation of those perceptions leads itself easily into research of the brain: What information is available to us though the technological investigation of brain and what can be determined from research regarding how consciousness is discussed physiologically. Much of the current research in the neuroscience community is occupied with the placement and location of consciousness and self. My own interest within these considerations is centered in the nature of self, place and imagination, and how the correspondence between these given fields of activity allow us to make decisions about what we understand as the world and ultimately how we determine it.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Achieving effective learning via digital media continues to be a major concern in contemporary education. The daily use of all forms of digital media is part of our lives and therefore becomes a key component of education. Educators must consider the process of digital media curriculum as a learning model and form of experience adapted to education. This means the significance is on how to learn as well as what to learn. This study demonstrated how the implementation of digital media curriculum via the Scratch game-making project contributed to middle school students&apos; interaction with the entire educational process. The goal was to rethink the role of digital media in transforming schooling. Based on classroom observation and interviews with the teachers and students from four middle schools in Denver, Colorado, the qualitative method of educational criticism and connoisseurship was employed to examine the use of digital media and the interaction between teaching and learning. Several themes emerged: (a) The production of digital media influenced students&apos; behavior and educators&apos; attitudes towards formal and informal learning; (b) digital citizenship is a substantial lesson in the course of digital learning and an understanding of the digital framework of society; (c) new literacy is critical, because ever-changing equipment supporting the digital experience provides dynamic and contrasting ways of connecting with society; (d) the reward of learning is by doing versus being told, and deeper learning is attained by students&apos; interacting with their own work; and (e) digital media programs, such as making video games for learning, provide students skills in communication, theoretical, aesthetic, creativity, and technical knowledge necessary for becoming successful digital citizens. The research revealed students&apos; enjoyment and effort in this new form of learning experience, which enhanced their critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity under teachers&apos; well-planned guidance. The challenge for educators is to constantly review and design educational approaches supporting students towards using the tools meaningfully and within a defined learning experience, continuing to help students become active participants and authors of their own identity and creativity. Educators need to find the best usage of digital media technology, providing students every advantage towards reaching an informed global perspective.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The inequities in learning between the rich and the poor have become pervasive in United States. This is evidenced by the high school graduation rates, college attendance percentages, and employment statistics. Upon another wave of reform, the Common Core State Standards in mathematics are currently being adopted in hopes of increasing learning for all students, with a focus on college and career readiness.   This study is intent on finding ways to remedy the inequities in mathematics between the high income and low income schools by focusing on one of the great glass ceilings to high school graduation and beyond, high school Algebra I.  This study gives examples of how successful teachers are providing opportunities for learning Algebra I despite barriers that students, administrators, and policy-makers deliver in low-income schools amidst the latest reform movement. The researcher provides a portrait of how three different algebra teachers in three different low-income high schools, in the same city in Colorado, teach within the confines of various reform mandates to meet the diverse needs of their students. The research was conducted with a particular focus on the classroom management strategies, student engagement strategies, culturally relevant pedagogy, and caring relationships contributed to the learning in these classrooms. Using observations, teacher interviews, and student interviews, the researcher employs the method of Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship to answer the research question. The question that guided this study was: What practices do effective algebra teachers employ in high poverty, diverse high school algebra classrooms to implement the curriculum and influence student learning? This question was supported by the sub-questions: (a) What classroom management strategies contribute to student learning?; (b) Which teaching strategies contribute to student engagement?; (c) Which culturally relevant pedagogy practices contribute to students&apos; opportunity to learn?; (d) How do relationships in the classroom support students&apos; opportunities to learn?; and (e) How are classroom management strategies, engagement strategies, culturally relevant pedagogy, and caring relationships intertwined in classrooms today? The findings of this study provide a stark warning to overly prescribed curricula and pedagogy, along with the heightened use of standardized tests tied to teacher evaluation. Answering the primary question using Eisner&apos;s (1998) dimensions of schooling and Uhrmacher&apos;s administrative dimension, paints a bleak picture for low-income schools under the current movement for accountability using student test scores. The negative consequences of a punitive administrative oversight on the teaching and learning of students paints a depressing scene for low-income schools. Conversely, the efforts of teachers to provide classroom management and student engagement supported by culturally relevant practices and caring relationships give a picture of hope if we focus on supporting and keeping in the schools that need them the most.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Education policy has focused on teacher quality and student achievement since the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, which defined teacher quality in terms of teachers&apos; professional qualifications and certification.  This is consistent with a history of econometric studies examining the effects of teacher background characteristics on student achievement.  More recently, researchers have argued that investigations of teacher effectiveness should examine what actually happens in the classroom, and that teacher attitudes and instructional practices are conspicuously missing from the prior research.This study uses a two-phase parallel mixed methods design to explore teacher perceptions of the influence of their background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement.  The first phase is a quantitative analysis using structural equation modeling and data from the Early-Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to examine the relative effects of teacher background characteristics, attitudes, and instructional practices on student achievement.  The second phase is a case study of an innovative elementary school meeting State expectations for student growth.The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that teacher attitudes typically have a significant effect on student achievement, but teacher background characteristics and perceptions related to their instructional practices do not.  The teachers in the case study agreed that teacher attitudes are important and are likely to have an effect on students, as well as on other teachers.  However, the teachers in the case study also perceived that a number of instructional practices are crucial to increasing student achievement and closing achievement gaps.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the relationships between three important cultural factors—acculturation, self-disclosure, and gender— and Korean American adolescents’ attitudes and expectations about group counseling. In addition, the relationships between two of these factors−acculturation and self-disclosure, and Korean parents’ expectations and attitudes about group counseling as a potential treatment modality for their adolescents were examined. Ninety-three Korean high school students who attended 9 private afterschool programs provided by the Korean Institute of Southern California (KISC) in the Los Angeles area and their 93 corresponding Korean parents participated in the present study. For the student sample, the four subscales of the Acculturation Attitudes Scale (Integration, Assimilation, Separation, and Marginalization), the Self-Disclosure Questionnaire, and gender served as predictor variables, and the Group Therapy Survey was used as an outcome variable. The multiple regression results indicated that integration and assimilation significantly contributed to the prediction of Korean adolescents’ attitudes and expectations about group counseling, with the integration being the strongest predictor of the other modes of acculturation. Results also indicated that integration was correlated with Korean adolescents’ positive attitudes and expectations about group counseling, whereas assimilation was correlated with their negative attitudes and expectations about group counseling. The level of
iii
comfort with self-disclosure and gender were not significant predictors of group counseling expectations among the Korean adolescents. For the parent sample, five predictor variables (the four modes of acculturation and self-disclosure) were entered into another multiple regression model to investigate the impact of these variables on Korean parents’ expectations about group counseling for their adolescents. The results indicated that integration and self-disclosure were significant predictors of the parents’ expectations about group counseling. Implications and limitations of the present study, and directions for future research are discussed. Additionally, some recommendations for school counselors who work with Korean students and their families are presented in Chapter 5.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore principals&apos; perspectives on how they make sense of their leadership roles in a new pay-for-performance system. The study describes the perceptions of six principals, two each from elementary, middle, and high school levels, regarding leadership in a recently changed system. Principals were asked about their leadership roles in implementing a pay-for-performance system, and responses focused on leadership styles, actions, beliefs, preparation, and experience of leading in a time of change. Four themes emerged from the data as significant aspects of leading change in a pay-for-performance system: (a) supporting a culture of excellence, (b) leading through sense making, (c) maintaining balance, and (d) providing instructional leadership.The theme of &quot;culture of excellence&quot; refers to the standpoint of preparing students for higher learning expectations. Participants discussed creating a &quot;high culture of excellence&quot; as setting a sense of urgency for learning. Principals&apos; responses were generally about how to set the stage to prepare students for learning. However, there was an underlying message that leaders must be able to establish a climate for learning by involving people throughout the process. The theme of &quot;leading through sense-making&quot; includes ideas that the leader needs to be able to make sense of a changing system for self and others, understand the significance of the change, and work actively with others as a change agent. The theme of &quot;maintaining balance&quot; describes participants&apos; feelings that money is not the sole motivation factor for teachers in a pay-for-performance system; it is more important to find the right balance of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Maintaining balance includes finding the right staff members, providing the right level of support, and balancing rewards for good teaching. Finally, the theme of &quot;providing instructional leadership&quot; focuses on the principal as a master of instructional practices. All of the participants felt that the most important role as a principal in a pay-for-performance system is to be an active instructional coach for their teaching staff. To foster improvement of teacher performance, the principal needs to provide instructional coaching and feedback, create a team atmosphere, and make regular visits to classrooms to establish a climate focused on improvement.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Test accommodations are designed to ensure the comparability of test scores between students and their typically developing counterparts by eliminating as much construct-irrelevant variance and construct-irrelevant difficulty as possible. Although those involved in test creation endeavor to create tests with suitable accommodations for students with disabilities, there is lack of consensus regarding accommodation efficacy. Using meta-analysis and meta-regression to summarize previous research, this study examined whether test accommodations differentially boost test scores of students with disabilities, and whether accommodated conditions provided a more effective and valid assessment of students with disabilities. Results from the meta-analysis of 34 studies (119 effect sizes) lend support to the differential boost hypotheses, whereby students with disabilities (mean effect size  = 0.30, k = 62, p &lt; 0.001) are positively impacted by test accommodations while their typically developing peers (mean effect size = 0.17, k = 57, p &lt; 0.001) gain little from test accommodations.Presentation assessment accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.22, k = 41, p &lt; 0.001) had a small statistically significant impact on the performance of students with disabilities, while use of timing/scheduling accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.47, k = 17, p &lt; 0.001) had a small, bordering on medium, statistically significant impact on these students. The effect for presentation accommodations intensified when narrowing the focus to students with learning disabilities (mean effect size  = 0.36, k = 23, p &lt; 0.001) but not for timing/scheduling accommodations (mean effect size  = 0.48, k = 13, p &lt; 0.001). Overall results for setting (k = 1) and response (k = 3) accommodations were not available as there were too few studies for an overall comparison.The results of meta-regression analyses examining the effects of assessment accommodations on test scores for students with disabilities showed that 42% of the heterogeneity in test score could be explained by an overall model examining population description, test characteristic, results dissemination, and researcher-manipulated (test accommodation effect size for students with disabilities) variables. Population description and test characteristic variable sets explained the greatest amounts of variability for mean increase in test score, R2=0.22 and R2 =0.35 respectively; researcher-manipulated variable (test accommodation) and research dissemination explained little variance, R2 =0.07 and R2 =0.01, respectively.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This dissertation is the result of a series of studies involving hot press lamination of inverted organic photovoltaics.  It first gives background and develops a lamination process for fabrication.  Then, the process is used to answer fundamental questions about organic photovoltaics and to fabricate previously impossible or overly complicated devices.  Finally, the author examines the scientific theory which describes the process and aligns that theory with related measurements.The field of organic photovoltaics is introduced and the lamination process is developed and optimized.  In the lamination process, part of the solar cell is deposited onto a rigid substrate, and the rest is deposited onto a flexible one.  The two substrates are pressed together under heat to complete the device.  Laminated devices are shown to perform as well or better than those made with standard fabrication methods, and the process shows benefits to both large scale production and scientific exploration of OPV devices.The lamination process is then used to answer physical questions and solve problems related to OPV.  After diversifying the procedure to include lamination at either the electron or hole contact, a series of semitransparent electrode materials are integrated into devices.  These materials are difficult or impossible to integrate into inverted devices without lamination.  Then bare metal contacts are pretreated and laminated into devices in order to investigate the mechanisms for time evolution in inverted devices.  Finally, two active layers are laminated to make a tandem device.  It is shown that the performance of the tandem is limited not by the procedure, but by the materials used in the interconnect layer between the two subcells.An investigation is performed that explores the physics behind the basis of lamination: adhesion.  Different mechanisms of adhesion are proposed, and calculations of adhesion forces based on known materials properties are made.  The resulting range of calculated forces is quite large, but within the range of measured values for adhesion force.  A general picture of the physics involved in lamination processes and their adhesion forces emerges.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Multiple incidents of postsecondary school shooting violence have occurred in American society--prompting concern about safety on college campuses, administrators&apos; roles in prevention, and proactive and responsible bystander actions.  Active shooter plans have become more established in educational environments, with efforts are directed toward both the perpetrator and the victims.  Limited information, however, has been provided regarding how bystanders would, or even should, construe and characterize their roles in such incidents.  Numerous professional and governmental researchers in organizations throughout the United States (e.g., the Center for Disease Control Injury Center, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, National Consortium on Violence Research-Carnegie Mellon University, and the Violence Prevention Research Program-University of California, Davis) have identified that prevention remains the best action.  The American Colleges Health Association (ACHA) leaders asked postsecondary educational institutions&apos; leaders to become engaged more actively in prevention efforts. In the current study, the researcher&apos;s own reconditioned hermeneutic design was used to examine appropriate bystander action during an incident of school shooting violence based on an Adapted Social Systems Model.  Internal and external socioeconomic factors with influence on student bystander action were addressed.  School administrators might find insight from the findings, implications, and future directions for research as discussed.  The results include a framework for the development of the ARISE bystander action model, a school violence ecological model in which the student bystander is placed in the center.  The ARISE model might be used as an action strategy for postsecondary institutions with a multidisciplinary approach to informing new policies and procedures.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), a rapidly growing group of neurodevelopmental disorders, affect nearly all aspects of development. The knowledge base of ASDs has increased significantly over the past half century due to translational research models (Rutter, 1999). Basic science and applied clinical work have informed research in a bi-directional manner. Through these models, much is now known about the language, behavioral, and cognitive difficulties associated with ASDs. However, autism research would benefit from further delineation of the differences between ASD types through the development of behavioral phenotypes. Behavioral phenotypes are expressions of particular aspects of disorders that may aid in further differentiation of subtypes of disorders (Hoddapp &amp; Dykens, 1997).In particular, little is known about math achievement and math interventions for students with ASDs. Despite federal mandates (IDEIA, 2004; NCLB, 2001) that strive to ensure that students with disabilities are held to the same high academic standards as other students, the research base on math interventions for students with ASDs is inadequate (Minshew, Sweeny, Bauman, &amp; Webb, 2005). ST Math, a computerized, pictorially-based math intervention contains many features that support the strengths of students with ASDs.To better understand the effect ST Math might have on the math achievement of students with ASDs, 10 students from a private school in Denver, Colorado participated in the ST Math program over the course of one school year. Individual behavioral phenotypes were developed for these students, based on information obtained from Individual Education Plans (IEPs). A combination of comparative and single-case analyses approaches were used to examine the effectiveness of ST Math for students with ASDs. As a whole, students performed better on post-ST Math assessments, compared to pre-ST Math assessments. Three students completed ST Math consistently and regularly, allowing for the use of Concomitant Time Series Analysis to examine the temporal dynamics between time on task and percentage of items answered correctly. Two of the three students showed significant, positive relationships between time on task and percentage of items answered correctly. Commonalities in the behavioral phenotypes of students who successfully participated in ST Math are compared to the behavioral phenotypes of students who did not. Implications for current practice and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Responses to Domestic Violence Public Service Ads: Memory, Attitudes, Affect, and Individual Differences</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Public service ads (PSAs) are an increasingly visible part of efforts to decrease the occurrence and consequences of domestic violence. Like other advertising, domestic violence PSAs are designed to grab attention, influence attitudes, and enhance memory for ad content. Over the years, images in domestic violence PSAs have changed substantially; agencies have started using pictures that generate emotions - either vivid negative images (bruised faces or body parts), or positive images (smiling faces) that contrast with the negative text. It is not clear, however, how different types of ad images influence memory for the message and attitudes about domestic violence, and what role affect may play in such responses. Moreover, the extent to which individual differences (trauma history, posttraumatic distress - PTSD symptoms) influence outcomes is not known. In three studies with undergraduate and community samples, using methods ranging from psychophysiology to self-report, the impact of images on attitudes and memory for ad content are investigated, also considering affect and individual differences. Results indicate graphic negative images enhanced memory for ad content, are rated as more persuasive, and are more likely to compel the viewer to act. Affective responses to ads also differed based on image type, and in some cases, partially mediated the relationship between ads and outcomes. Trends in the data suggest further study of the role of individual differences (trauma history, PTSD symptoms) is needed. This research provides information specifically relevant to the design of domestic violence public service campaigns and broadly relevant to understanding the role of emotional responses and individual differences on outcomes associated with public service ads.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Utilizing textual analysis and in-depth interviews of self-identified Christian participants ages 18-35 (n=20), this dissertation explores the way Comedy Central&apos;s &lt;italic&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/italic&gt; portrays Christianity, how young Christian viewers negotiate their religio-political identity in relation to the show, and what this negotiation says about the religio-political landscape of Christian emerging adults (19-29) (Arnett, 2004) in the United States. I conclude that &lt;italic&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/italic&gt; provides a contextual occasion for critical religio-political reflection, and that Christian emerging adults of myriad Christian subcultures negotiate their religio-political identity in relation to &lt;italic&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/italic&gt; to varying degrees as they select differing reference points within the show as a means of shaping and strengthening previous and ongoing identity markers.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The physical environment of the classroom impacts teachers and students. In many settings teachers are given some autonomy but little guidance in the establishment of the physical environment of the classroom.  Relatively few studies examine issues related to the totality of the physical environment of the classroom. This study is intended to provide a bridge between multiple disciplines and classroom application by describing and interpreting the intentions and decision making process of three teachers in the establishment of the physical environment of their classrooms.The five questions that guided this study focused on intentions of the teacher related to the physical environment, her/his philosophical and pedagogical beliefs, if the intentions were realized (or not) within the practice; impact of physical environment on teaching practice and the significance of examining the relationship between the physical environment of the classroom and the teacher&apos;s values and intentions.The methodology utilized for this study is Educational Connoisseurship and Criticism. This investigation provides detailed descriptions and interpretation of the experiences of three classroom teachers in vastly different school sites. Data collection includes multiple observations, interviews and artifact review.Several key findings emerged: 1) Teacher intentions for the physical environment to of the classroom were influenced by personal experiences and educational beliefs, 2) There is a symbiotic relationship between the physical environment of the classroom and the other dimensions of the classroom including curriculum offerings, instructional strategies and pedagogical techniques, classroom structure and organizational systems 3) Architectural elements exerted force over several of Eisner&apos;s dimensions of school including teacher intentions, and 4) the teacher&apos;s view of the flexibility of the space impacted both intention and use of the physical environment.This study has a variety of implications within the field of education as well as across disciplines. Implications from this study impact teacher education programs, practicing school administrators and planners, the school reform movement as schools with specific philosophies seek to create environments which support their mission and cross-disciplinary issues related to building design and planning, school furnishing design, lighting and color theory, and environmental hazard and impact.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Withholding Political Authority: Civil Society and People&apos;s Power in Zimbabwe</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The relationship of civil society to the state is rarely antagonistic and at most times supportive. The political regime and civil society are taken to be interdependent social structures that interact through hegemonic, supportive and socially constructed dimensions. Given this interdependency, when does civil society challenge authority or does its efforts rise to the level of a people&apos;s power revolution? When does it act to dismantle the political regime or seek to reconstruct it? This project attempts to shed light on how civil society mobilizes a people&apos;s power capable of challenging political authority through the story of its ongoing struggles to pursue social objectives in Zimbabwe in the 1990s.Since 1980, the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) controlled the only post-colonial government Zimbabwe has known. Drawing from its revolutionary credentials it set out to finish the interrupted war for Zimbabwean Independence. This objective resonated with civil society less and less over time as groups began to see Zanu&apos;s promises as hollow and its corruption and patronage systems as the primary obstacle in accomplishing their objectives. This development is explored through a grassroots empowerment movement, the Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress, the widespread protests in 1997 catalyzed by the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions and the efforts to rebuild the constitutional order spearheaded by the National Constitutional Assembly.The story points to at least three civil society strategies to locate power within the people and counter political power: 1) constructing political alternatives within the existing regime, 2) mass withdrawal of support for the authority of the regime and 3) reconstruction of the social contract. Nevertheless, civil society did not succeed in dismantling the political regime, hampered by the continuing capacity of the state to exert hegemonic control, remove the pillars of civil society support and exploit polarized values within civil society.Despite the terrible destruction of social and economic fabric of the country by the political struggles of the 2000s, the ongoing development of democratic values and the diminishing importance of the interrupted revolution can provide a glimmer of hope for the future transformation of the country.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The phrase cooperative learning refers to a pedagogical learning and teaching technique in use in schools from kindergarten through higher education.  The technique involves the structuring of an active classroom environment with students working in groups to discover, solve, and at its basic, provide a framework for dialogue and conversation.  Cooperative learning is grounded in the development of a theory of social interdependence (Morton Deutsch) which states that individuals, working in groups, can in most cases provide for greater productivity and ideas than individuals working alone.  The development of cooperative learning was greatly expanded in the late 1960&apos;s and early 1970&apos;s with the invention of specific group learning techniques led by researchers David and Robert Johnson (Learning Together), Elliot Aronson (Jigsaw), and Robert Slavin (STAD).  These researchers established guidelines (rules) and taxonomies that provided a basis for research in the area of cooperative learning.  At the center of all of these techniques is an element of human communication, most often through the oral/aural communication channel, where group learning and discovery takes place.Cooperative learning and collaborative learning techniques differ in the amount andimplementation of teaching guidelines required in the methodology.  This study (a meta-analysis) weaves through more than 14-hundred published pieces of literature in a varietyof disciplines, narrowing it down to 19 published articles which investigate (through experiments) the effectiveness through learning outcomes of cooperative learning in higher education (college and university level).With studies including more than 2-thousand student-participants in the research, data indicates no significant difference between those classrooms utilizing a cooperative learning format, and those using a traditional lecture/discussion format (d =0.05, 95%, C1:-05 to .14, p&gt;.05, k = 21, N = 2,052).  Though there is no statistical difference between the two teaching techniques, researchers do offer a list of positive classroom observations/variables, which provides a launching point for future research into the use of cooperative learning techniques in higher education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The present study examined MMPI-2 data of 377 missionary candidates who presented for psychological assessment at Missionary Care Services. The purpose of the study was to establish a normative profile for missionary candidates to enhance interpretive validity and reduce missionary attrition. Mean T scores were established for the missionary candidate sample on the F, L, and K validity scales and the ten Clinical Scales. Analyses were conducted to compare the mean T scores of the missionary candidate sample to the mean T scores of the nonclinical normative population of persons taking the MMPI-2 for employment purposes. For both males and females, 10 of the 13 scales analyzed were significantly different from the nonclinical normative population. Results indicated that caution is suggested in interpreting the K scale. Further implications for increasing interpretive validity are discussed. Analyses were conducted to assess trends for MMPI-2 profiles of the missionary candidate sample over time. Results indicated that the mean T score on the K Scale for candidates tested between 1992 and 2002 was significantly higher than the mean T scores for candidates tested between 2003 and 2006 and candidates tested between 2007 and 2010. Analyses were conducted to assess trends by date of birth. Results indicated that the mean T score on the K Scale for Generation Y candidates was significantly lower than the mean T scores for Baby Boomer and Generation X candidates. Results also indicated that the mean T score on Scale 1 for Baby Boomer candidates was significantly higher than the mean T score for Generation Y candidates. Implications of analyses by date of testing and date of birth for the missionary candidate assessment process are discussed. Future research is needed to further enhance the quality of the missionary candidate assessment process.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this dissertation we study the Cayley-Dickson loops, multiplicative structures arising from the standard Cayley-Dickson doubling process. More precisely, the Cayley-Dickson loop Qn is the multiplicative closure of basic elements of the algebra constructed by n applications of the doubling process (the first few examples of such algebras are real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, sedenions). Starting at the octonions, Cayley-Dickson algebras and loops become nonassociative, which presents a significant challenge in their study.We describe basic properties of the Cayley-Dickson loops Qn, e.g., inverses, conjugates, orders of elements, and diassociativity. We discuss some important subloops of Qn, for instance, associator subloop, derived subloop, nuclei, center, and show that Qn areHamiltonian. We show that all subloops of Qn of order 16 fall into two isomorphism classes, in particular, any such subloop is either isomorphic to the octonion loop, or the quasioctonion loop. We discuss automorphism groups, inner mapping groups, and multiplication groups of the Cayley-Dickson loops, and describe the progress made on the study of their subloop structure. We also provide incidence tetrahedra for the sedenion loop and other subloops of order 32, generalizing the idea of the octonion multiplication Fano plane.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Mentoring provides personal support, academic assistance and career guidance to college students of color whose experiences have been documented to be very different from those of their White counterparts. Achievement inequity, problems of persistence, experiences of racism and student reports of feeling marginalized and misunderstood threaten the ability of students of color to succeed in college. While it may be assumed that race plays a central role in the mentoring relationships of students of color, this assumption may be misguided.  The existence of formal mentoring programs and informal mentoring relationships that support students of color does not necessarily ensure that the confounded issue of race is appropriately embedded as a shaping force in the mentor/mentee association. This paper will deconstruct the assumption that approaches to the mentoring of students of color automatically consider race by applying Critical Race Theory as a theoretical framework to examine if and how race is present in the relationship between mentors and their African American student mentees at predominantly White institutions of higher education. Using phenomenological research design, this study brings race out of the rhetoric of higher education and places it in the center of examination to uncover student perceptions of race and how it operates within the mentoring relationship to help us better understand how we ensure high quality mentoring can be actively applied in our efforts to support the success of college students of color.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Physical activity is important, and many adolescents are not meeting the recommendation that youth participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week (CDC, 2011). Physical inactivity among middle school students is on the rise and may be a contributing factor to a decline in academic performance. Prior research has focused  primarily on bodily health; however, growing evidence supports the benefits of physical activity for academic achievement (Chomitz et al., 2009). This  study  examined the relationship between middle school students&apos; perceptions of physical activity and student engagement they relate to academic achievement among 179 middle school students in one suburban middle school. Additionally, this study sought to investigate  students&apos; perceptions of physical activity as well as the context within which these perceptions take place, which may lead to more effective strategies to help improve academic achievement. Propositions from Bronfenbrenner&apos;s ecological theory were used to examine the different factors influencing the relationship between middle school students&apos; perceptions of physical activity and student engagement as they relate to academic achievement.This study is predominantly a correlational and regression design, which examines relationships and predictive ability of key variables. This research design will add depth to the study by investigating the social influences in schools regarding the relationship between physical activity, student engagement, and academic achievement</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Disrupting the deficit discourse on historically Black colleges and universities: An organizational identity case study of Philander Smith College</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines a historically Black institution of higher education as &quot;any historically Black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principle mission was, and is, the education of Black Americans.&quot; Today, there are approximately 105 HBCUs, more than half private, the rest public, and a few two-year institutions (Allen, Jewell, Griffin, &amp; Wolf, 2007). While currently only 14 percent of Black college students attend HBCUs, 70 percent of all Black doctors and dentists, 50 percent of all Black engineers and public school teachers, and 35 percent of all Black attorneys received their bachelor&apos;s degrees at an HBCU (Avery, 2009). Despite these notable statistics, leaders associated with HBCUs have felt insecure about their future since the 1950s for a variety of issues; namely low enrollments, low endowments, loss of accreditation, and severe decreases in fiscal resources (Avery, 2009).However, missing from the discourse is a discussion of which HBCUs are currently staying ahead of the national and higher education economic crises by implementing effective leadership and financial management strategies. The academic literature fails to explicitly highlight HBCUs that are not only surviving in these times of economic difficulty, but actually thriving and remaining credible and supportive institutions in the respective community.In an effort to go against the trend of only highlighting the myriad financial and accreditation issues plaguing HBCUs, this doctoral dissertation study will illuminate the ways in which these institutions are efficiently addressing such problems, and typically doing so with less fiscal resources than other institutions of higher education (Gates, 2010). Philander Smith College has consistently been referenced in the journalistic literature as one HBCU that is successfully navigating historical and current problems stemming from a lack of fiscal resources. An organizational identity case study of this institution will shed light on the effective leadership and fiscal management strategies being executed by HBCUs in the 21st century. The findings of this study result in the construction of a model of best operational and leadership practices. It is the author&apos;s hope that both models will be adaptable and useful for other HBCUs.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>IMPLICATING BITZER&apos;S RHETORICAL SITUATION IN COMPARATIVE AND NON-VIOLENT RHETORIC: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF THREE ECOFEMINIST MOVEMENTS FROM EAST TO WEST.</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In the study of social movement rhetoric, scholars often focus on movements based in Western nations, foregoing study of social change in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and other parts of the world. Similarly, the focus on non-violent rhetoric has also been lacking, despite its use by great leaders such as Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King. This dissertation contributes to the study of social change in a globalized world, by taking a comparative approach to non-violent rhetoric in three diverse case studies. As sub-areas, both comparative rhetoric and non-violent rhetoric require further deliberation due to the numerous debates concerning their meanings and approaches. Comparative and non-violent rhetoric are significant areas of study because they encourage mutual understanding by striving for common ground among people of different cultures, faith traditions, and political opinion. In this dissertation, I will demonstrate how Western and non-Western forms of social movement rhetoric complement each other to enhance our understanding of comparative rhetoric. I turn to both Western and non-Western ecofeminists to examine how the women optimize non-violent rhetoric, and the ways in which their cultural statushelp advance and/or hinder their activism. I specifically turn to the Chipko movement in India, Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, and Julia Butterfly Hill in the United States, for an in-depth understanding of non-violent rhetoric in direct action. I use rhetorical criticism and Bitzer&apos;s (1968) rhetorical situation, to analyze the exigency, audience, and constraints in the three case studies. I argue that Bitzer as a theoretical framework is broad enough to study a variety of cultures/situations; yet, it is sufficiently well-defined to allow for useful analysis. I also contend, non-violent rhetoric is a tactic and manifestation of a philosophy that aims to address exigencies, and amend the relationship of the adversary to an ally. Non-violent rhetoric does not only address the material conditions of a situation, but also incorporates the spiritual and/or religious as a mode of address. Including a spiritual/religious dimension in the study of social movements enhances our understanding of social movements beyond the instrumental.The case studies in this dissertation reveal that non-violent tactics are selected and practiced as they align with spiritual/moral/religious values. My analysis also demonstrates how non-violence is used in some cultures to counter irresponsible environmental practice in the name of &quot;development.&quot; Finally, I provide extended definitions for both comparative and non-violent rhetoric and suggestions for futureresearch.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the session-to-session change in symptom severity and social bonding ability in the participants of groups for survivors of sexual trauma. The concept of social bonding ability was addressed by examining the participants&apos; beliefs about the availability of social support, their beliefs about themselves, and their beliefs about their relationships with their group leaders. Group leader ratings of the level of process focus of their group were also measured. Twenty women between the ages of 19 and 55 receiving group treatment at three community agencies in Colorado were included in the study. Groups included in the study were either open or closed, were targeted at sexual trauma survivors and met for a minimum of 10 weeks. Assessment measures utilized included the Outcome Questionnaire 45 (OQ-45), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form Revised (WAI-SR), the Childhood Sexual Abuse Questionnaire (CSAQ), and the Sexual Experiences Survey Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV). Participants completed the SES-SFV, CSAQ, ISEL, WAI-SR, PCL-C and the OQ-45 prior to treatment. Participants also completed the OQ-45, WAI, and ISEL prior to each group therapy session for sessions two to 10, for a total of 10 weeks of data. Data were analyzed with profile analyses, hierarchical multiple regression, and paired sample t-tests. Results showed that there were significant pre to post treatment changes on all measures of symptom severity and bonding ability after 10 sessions of treatment.  There were significant differences in symptom severity based on ability to form social bonds. However, after controlling for pretreatment symptom severity, level of bonding ability was not a significant predictor of post treatment symptom severity. There were no significant differences in the ability to form social bonds over time based on level of process focus of the group and all groups including some amount of focus on process increased the ability to form social bonds. Regardless of level of process focus, group treatments produced significant increases in the ability to bond to the therapist over time. There were no significant differences in bonding ability or symptom severity between participants in the open and closed groups, and both groups experienced similar rates of reduction in symptoms over time. Overall, these findings suggest that brief group treatment for sexual trauma survivors may improve social bonding ability and decrease ratings of symptom severity. Also significant for sexual trauma group psychotherapy research is the ability for women to benefit from either open or closed group treatments. Further research on a larger scale is needed to learn how level of group process focus affect group members and how social bonding ability develops in psychotherapy.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project was designed to develop the Corporate Safety Culture Scale, a unique measure of corporate safety culture that is supported by a strong theoretical foundation.  Items were developed conceptually, discussed in cognitive interviews, and submitted to expert review.  Survey items were administered to employees of a large public transportation organization.  Principle components analysis reduced the data and identified an empirical model.  The empirical model held two domains identified as: 1) &quot;Values,&quot; and 2) &quot;Behavior.&quot;  Confirmatory factor analysis compared the fit of the empirical model with that of a modified empirical model, and the hypothesized model, which held the following three domains: 1) &quot;Behavior,&quot; 2) &quot;Values,&quot; and 3) &quot;Meaning Systems.&quot; Goodness of fit indices (Chi-Squared, RMSEA, CFI, ECVI) identified the modified empirical structure as the model with best fit.   The similarities between the hypothesized and modified empirical models suggested that the CSCS carries strong theoretical support.The measure&apos;s reliability was tested using Cronbach&apos;s Alpha.  The full CSCS and each identified domain were shown to have strong Alpha values.  One-way between groups analysis of variance, was used to evaluate the relationship between scores on the full measure and a categorical safety behavior item.  Findings suggested that high scorers on the CSCS were safer workers than those with lower scores on the measure.  A post hoc analysis using Tukey&apos;s HSD showed that scores on the full CSCS, and the &quot;Behavior&quot; domain were significantly related to safety behavior.  The analysis of variance and the post hoc results indicated that a relationship exists between the CSCS and safety behavior.  This finding added to the validity of the measure.  The CSCS was shown to be a theoretically supported, valid and reliable measure that can be used to evaluate corporate safety culture.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>There is a dropout epidemic in the United States. In the US, 25% of high school students do not graduate on time. For Latinos, the number is worse, with only 64% graduating from high school. Current research is clear that 9th grade is a critical year for keeping students in school. Students that earn all their credits for their core classes in 9th grade are more likely to graduate than students who fail one or more class during their freshman year. Prior to this study, engagement has been connected to dropout in the literature, but with differing ideas of how to measure engagement. The Student School Engagement Measure (SSEM) could be one tool used to estimate levels of engagement and identify students at risk of dropping out. This study used structural equation modeling to identify whether 8th grade SSEM scores were a significant predictor of credits earned by the end of 9th grade. The results of this study indicated that 8th grade SSEM scores were not a significant predictor of credits earned at the end of 9th grade, supporting previous research has found that engagement changes from year to year. These findings suggest that measuring engagement over the course of a single year, instead of using the SSEM as a long term predictor, might be a more useful use of the SSEM.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL WATER SPLITTING FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION WITH METAL OXIDE (HEMATITE AND CUPRIC OXIDE) BASED PHOTOCATALYSTS</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Solar hydrogen is one ideal energy source to replace fossil fuel, as it is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Solar hydrogen can be generated in a number of ways. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most promising methods for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. In this research project, metal oxide-based photocatalysts, especially hematite (&lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;Ñ-Fe2O3) and cupric oxide (CuO), were investigated for use as electrodes in PEC water splitting for solar hydrogen production.In our research project of hematite-based electrodes, we started with the incorporation of transition metal, particularly titanium (Ti), in hematite thin films to modify the valence and conduction band edges of hematite. We found that Ti impurities improve the electron conductivity of hematite and consequently lead to significantly enhanced photocurrents. We further investigated the Ti and Mg co-alloyed hematite. In this case, Ti is the donor and Mg is the acceptor in hematite. The co-alloying approach enhanced the solubility of Mg and Ti, which led to reduced electron effective mass and therefore increased electron mobility. Also, co-alloying tunes the carrier density and therefore allows the optimization of electrical conductivity. The densities of charged defects were found to be reduced, and therefore carrier recombinations were reduced. As a result, the Ti and Mg co-alloyed hematite thin films exhibited much improved performance in PEC water splitting as compared to pure hematite thin films.For the study of cupric oxide-based electrodes, we first investigated the possibility of reducing the electrode corrosion of cupric oxide in aqueous solutions by incorporating Ti as an electrode corrosion inhibitor. We found that Ti alloying can enhance the stability of cupric oxide in base solutions at the cost of reducing its crystallinity and optical absorption, and consequently lowering its photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. In order to balance the stability and the generated photocurrent, we developed a two-layer structure in which a thin layer of Cu-Ti-O was deposited on bare CuO thin film as a protective layer. Our experimental results indicated that this two-layer structure has an ideal thickness for the protection layer and is suitable for high-performance and long-term application for PEC water splitting.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The current study replicated and extended existing research on gratitude by examining the ways in which gratitude is related to both individual and relationship well-being. A total of 387 participants completed the pre assessment and were randomized into the study, with 251 participants completing the full study (i.e., pre, post, and follow-up assessments). Participants were randomly assigned to list relationship-focused gratitudes, amusing events, or general events that happened during their day for 14 days. The differential impact of the three interventions on both individual and relationship variables was investigated.  The relationship-focused and general events conditions experienced decreased negative affect from the pre to post assessment compared to the amusement condition. There were no other group differences. Participants across conditions experienced increases in life satisfaction, gratitude, and relationship confidence, as well as decreases in negative interaction. There also appeared to be short-term decreases in positive affect and positive connection for participants in all conditions. Changes in gratitude were associated with increases in relationship well-being. Additionally, cross-sectional analyses indicated that gratitude was associated with both individual and relationship well-being. Possible explanations for the lack of group differences as well as implications for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Wireless communication has experienced an incredible growth in the last decade. Two decades ago,the number of mobile subscribers was less than 1% of the world&apos;spopulation. As of 2011, the number of mobile subscribers has increased tremendously to 79.86% of the world&apos;s population.Robust and high-rate data transmission in mobile environments faces severe problemsdue to the time-variant channel conditions, multipath fading and shadow fading. Fading is the main limitation on wireless communication channels. Frequency selective interference and fading, such as multipath fading, is a bandwidth bottleneck in the &quot;last mile&quot; whichruns from the access point to the user. The &quot;last mile&quot; problemin wireless communication networks is caused by the environment of free space channels through which the signal propagates. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)is a promising modulation and multiplexing technique due to its robustness against multipath fading. Nevertheless, OFDM suffers from high Peak-to-Average- Power-Ratio (PAPR), which results in a complex OFDM signal. In this research, reduction of PAPR considering the out-of-band radiation and the regeneration of the time-domain signalpeaks caused by filtering has been studied and is presented. Our PAPR reduction was30% of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (IFDMA) utilizing Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and varying the roll-off factor. We show that pulse shaping does not affect the PAPR of Localized Frequency Division Multiple Access (LFDMA) as much as it affects the PAPR of IFDMA. Therefore, IFDMA has an important trade-off relationship between excess bandwidth and PAPR performance, since excess bandwidth increases as the roll-off factor increases.In addition, we studied a low complexity clipping scheme, applicable to IFDMA uplink and OFDM downlink systems for PAPR reduction. We show that the performance of the PAPRof the Interleaved-FDMA scheme is better than traditional OFDMA for the uplinktransmission system. Our reduction of PAPR is 53% when IFDMA is used instead ofOFDMA in the uplink direction. Furthermore, we also examined an important trade-off relationship between clipping distortion and quantization noise when the clipping schemeis used for OFDM downlink systems. Our results show a significant reduction in the PAPR and the out-of-band radiation caused by clipping for OFDM downlink transmission system.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>In Search of a Contextual Pastoral Theology for Dalits in India</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Current approaches to the ministry of pastoral care and counseling in the South Indian context lack a serious grasp of the critical needs of survival, liberation and cultural identity of the Dalit Christian communities. Prevailing models of care that are individualistic and based on clerical hierarchy have failed to give adequate attention to the systemic, cultural and psychological dimensions of the contextual needs of the Dalit Christians and foster a shared understanding of their problems. The theological and cultural sources that inform the pastoral care practices are not indigenous to their context and therefore fail to provide a critical and constructive perspective on the needs that arise in the context of caste oppression.This study develops a communal contextual and intercultural approach to pastoral care and theology that is interdisciplinary in nature and informed by indigenous sources of knowledge, Dalit liberation theology as well as Latin American liberation psychology to respond to the contextual needs of the Dalit people. The communal contextual approach seeks to understand pastoral needs in their wider sociocultural and political contexts that include the realities of caste prejudice, patriarchy and sexism, among others. The communal contextual approach also expands the ministry of care from being the exclusive domain of the ordained clergy to include caring resources of the faith community, thereby affirming the collective subjectivity of the Dalit communities. The intercultural approach offers a framework not only for facilitating a healthy, constructive and respectful interaction with other cultures, but also for empowering marginal communities such as the Dalits. This approach encourages Dalits to resist the hegemonic nature of the dominant discourses while also affirming and privileging Dalit cultural perspectives and resources to build and strengthen Dalit cultural identity. As an intercultural approach, it pays particular attention to the power dynamics that come into play when two cultures interact. Dalit liberation theology provides the theological rationale and cornerstone for this communal contextual and intercultural approach to care. This theology is operationalized using strategies of intervention from narrative theory as conceptualized by Michael White and David Epston. This dissertation, written from a Dalit perspective, argues that this new model of pastoral care and theology creates new possibilities that theologically empower Dalits to not only to reimagine their `Dalitness&apos; by reclaiming their cultural heritage, but also to effectively address their critical issues of survival, liberation and developing a cultural identity.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The motivation for this work is the need to remove waste heat from laser diodes and high speed transistors in processes which are exponentially increasing past 1 kW/cm2 as anticipated by Moore&apos;s Law. The hypothesis guiding the work is that ultrasonic insonation of micro coolers employed to dissipate these heat loads can improve heat removal. It is thought that the mechanism promoting the benefit is enhancement of the ability of the coolant to remove latent heat in two-phase operation by managing entrained bubble size near the cooler&apos;s exit so as to forestall flow reduction or blockage caused by large bubbles, wedges and slugs accumulating there. Insonation experiments to prove the hypothesis have been done on several micro channel coolers in the range 4-80 kHz to quantify improvement in heat flux removal. In order to understand how insonation would produce benefit in heat removal, a research effort was undertaken to study the affect of 5-30 Pa acoustic fields on air bubbles rising in small aquariums. This involved developing a Faraday cage shielded acoustic probe, along with a force-beam calibration tool, for measuring field levels near a strongly electromagnetic-radiating ultrasonic source. Experiments were conducted on columns of pseudo monodisperse, sub-millimeter diameter air bubbles in water, and other fluids using bubble generators optimized for this purpose. A numerical analysis model based on energy balance of the acoustic work done on a bubble resulted in predicting mass transfer flux, and in quantifying bubble shrinkage and growth when irradiated on either side of its resonance. The model, and experiments show that bubble populations can be predictably altered by ultrasound. The research was concluded by identifying and quantifying micro channel cooler performance change when insonated in the range 4-80 kHz. It was discovered that 28 and 58 kHz radiation of exchangers having hydraulic diameters spanning 0.02 to 0.6 mm could produce heat flux removal improvements of 5 W/cm2 in devices normally removing less than 30 W/cm2, a factor of 17%. Peak thermal resistance improvement approaching 60 % has been observed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Informal kinship caregivers take on the responsibility of raising a relative&apos;s children in situations where those children cannot remain with their parents and are not in the custody of child welfare. The phenomenon is increasing, however it is difficult to obtain information from these families because of the difficulty locating them. As a result, there is limited research on this specific group of kinship care families. The purpose of this study was exploratory, using qualitative methods to gather information from informal kinship caregivers about their experiences caring for a relative&apos;s children with a focus on the rewards and challenges within those experiences. A second purpose was to enable participants to tell their stories so that information could be used by practitioners and policymakers. The 14 participants in this study described a path to informal kinship care that began with precipitating events that resulted in the children&apos;s not being able to live with their parents, followed by the decision to provide care, and then the quest to obtain legal custody of them. The caregivers next began a journey through the experiences of being informal kinship caregivers, which included both rewards and challenges. Four themes emerged to characterize those rewards and challenges: experiences with family, experiences with systems, financial experiences, and emotional experiences. Participants provided recommendations for both practitioners and policymakers, which included requests for more recognition and respect as well as more emotional, social, legal, and financial support. Despite all the difficulties, none of the participants regretted their decision to care for their relative&apos;s children.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explored several predictors of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) in a sample of 136 train employees. The first objective was to examine the influence of number of work related traumas, number of life traumas, age, personality characteristic extroversion, personality characteristic openness, social support, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping in the prediction of PTSD. The second objective was to assess the influence of number of work related traumas, number of life traumas, age, personality characteristic extroversion, personality characteristic openness, social support, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping prediction of PTG.Freight train employees from a major transportation company in the United States participated in the study. There has not been a thorough exploration of negative and positive outcomes of trauma in the literature with this population. The study attempted to gain further understanding of PTSD and PTG in train employees by using simple linear regression analyses to investigate number of traumas in predicting PTSD and PTG. The study then utilized hierarchical regression analyses to investigate how number of work related traumas, number of life traumas, age, personality characteristic extroversion, personality characteristic openness, social support, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping were related to PTSD and then in a separate regression using the same variables to predict PTG.Results of this study indicated that number of work traumas predicted PTSD, although number of work traumas did not predict PTG. Also, factors in the hierarchical model that were significant predictors of PTSD were number of work traumas, number of life traumas, negative cognitive coping, and positive cognitive coping.  In the model predicting PTG, social support, negative cognitive coping, and positive cognitive coping were statistically significant. The field of PTG is relatively young in comparison to the study of more pathological trauma, PTSD. Previous research has indicated personality factors, social support, and cognitive processing to have theoretical bases in the emergence of growth, and can also serve as protective factors for negative trauma reactions.  This is the first study to look at PTG in train employees and to also apply personality characteristics, social support, and cognitive coping. The results of the study provide evidence that social support, negative cognitive coping, and positive cognitive coping are related to PTG. Further, results indicated that number of work traumas, number of life traumas, positive cognitive coping, and negative cognitive coping predicted PTSD.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Communication researchers have much to gain and contribute by paying sustained attention to the implications, contributions, and consequences of the interpretation and (re)production of work as a calling. While work calling has been theoretically and quantitatively conceptualized in a number of disciplines, it remains lacking in evidence of how the lived experiences and sensemaking discourses of participants serve to (re)construct this concept. Thus, the current study is qualitatively guided by asking, how people from different professional domains communicate about their experiences of work as a calling. To begin, I assess the overarching themes related to work calling in the areas of organizational psychology, sociology, theology, and business. Second, I suggest that interweaving meaningful work, spiritual communication, and organizational rhetoric creates rich academic space for the study of work calling as a communicative concept. Third, using thematic analysis, I identify participant communication about work calling from twenty-nine interviews, informal observations, and artifact analysis. Three dominant themes emerged: (a) definitional markers, (b) inherent interaction, and (c) significant costs. The theme of definitional markers provides a conceptualizing basis for work calling, the theme of inherent interaction relates to the enactment of work calling, and the theme of significant costs describe potential consequences of this approach. From such discourse, work calling is revealed as a complex, constitutive, and contested term, providing promising avenues of research.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>QUANTIFYING AND FORECASTING VULNERABILITY TO DYADIC CONFLICT IN AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODEL:  MODELING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORY</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The character of state interaction matters. This dissertation quantifies this interaction from 1960-2001 and then forecasts it from 2010-2050. I contribute to the field of International Relations by improving traditional measures of Realism and Liberalism, quantifying new perspectives sensitive to cultural interaction, and statistically evaluating these indices relative to the occurrence of conflict. It is the first step in an academic research agenda that desires to expand the scope of possibility regarding the modeling of International Relations theory for the purpose of theory evaluation and policy analysis.This dissertation spans two fields of study that do not typically overlap:  International Relations and Integrated Assessment Modeling. I begin by laying a broad foundation to bridge this chasm. I do this by first exploring knowledge constraints associated with forecasting. This leads to an overview of my conceptual and empirical tool for calibrating my final model: the historic occurrence of international conflict. Next, I introduce conceptual and applied systems theory, which leads to an overview of the International Futures (IFs) model.I then explore Liberalism and Realism as they have been traditionally operationalized at the macro-level.  A newly quantified variable--referred to as the Cultures of Interaction Index-- is introduced that builds on Liberal notions and tries to explain some aspect of intersubjective norms and values operating in a dyad. I perform statistical analysis on these indices and show that using IR theories in conjunction explains more of the historic occurrence of conflict--and thus the character of state interaction--than using any theoretical tradition in isolation. I then endogenize Liberalism and Realism in IFs and use the cultural measure as an exogenous constant. I am interested in whether the stock of culture in a dyad and growth in Liberal notions of interdependence can off-set negative pressures arising from Realism.Most dyads improve their character of interaction to 2050, but some become more conflictual, including China - US and China - India. The analysis is extended by looking at long-term structural shifts in the global system:  depleted fossil fuel reserves, stressed fresh water availability and tension from domestic instability. I conclude by offering a series of next steps that builds upon this work and recommendations for policy planners concerned with the future of interstate relations.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>As the potential emerging technology for next generation integrated resonant sensors and frequency references as well as electronic filters, micro-electro-mechanical resonators have attracted a lot of attention over the past decade. As a result, a wide variety of high frequency micro/nanoscale electromechanical resonators have recently been presented. MEMS resonators, as low-cost highly integrated and ultra-sensitive mass sensors, can potentially provide new opportunities and unprecedented capabilities in the area of mass sensing. Such devices can provide orders of magnitude higher mass sensitivity and resolution compared to Film Bulk Acoustic resonators (FBAR) or the conventional quartz and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonators due to their much smaller sizes and can be batch-fabricated and utilized in highly integrated large arrays at a very low cost.In this research, comprehensive experimental studies on the performance and durability of thermally actuated micromechanical resonant sensors with frequencies up to tens of MHz have been performed. The suitability and robustness of the devices have been demonstrated for mass sensing applications related to air-borne particles and organic gases.In addition, due to the internal thermo-electro-mechanical interactions, the active resonators can turn some of the consumed electronic power back into the mechanical structure and compensate for the mechanical losses. Therefore, such resonators can provide self-sustained-oscillation without the need for any electronic circuitry. This unique property has been deployed to demonstrate a prototype self-sustained sensor for air-borne particle monitoring.I have managed to overcome one of the obstacles for MEMS resonators, which is their relatively poor temperature stability. This is a major drawback when compared with the conventional quartz crystals. A significant decrease of the large negative TCF for the resonators has been attained by doping the devices with a high concentration of phosphorous, resulting in even slightly positive TCF for some of the devices. This is also expected to improve the phase noise characteristics of oscillators implemented utilizing such frequency references by eliminating the sharp dependence to electronic noise in the resonator bias current.Finally it is well known that non-uniformities in fabrication of MEMS resonators lead to variations in their frequency. I have proposed both active (non-permanent) and permanent frequency modification to compensate for variations in frequency of the MEMS resonators.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Preschool children&apos;s perceptions around gender identity and development can be influenced by their experiences.  With many children spending a portion of their day in child care, the environmental factors of these programs are important.  One aspect of the environment can impact preschool children is the books that are available to them.  For over 40 years, children&apos;s literature in the United States has been studied and found to be biased in their portrayal of males and females.  Males were more often found as main characters and depicted as capable leaders and thinkers.  Female characters were shown as weaker, often appearing in home settings and in traditional work roles.This study was conducted in Denver, Colorado and Oslo, Norway to compare the preschool literature between the two countries, since Norway has consistently ranked as one of the most gender equal countries in the world.  The question was whether the greater equality in Norwegian society would be reflected in the books that are read to its young children.The results of the study indicate that while both countries continue to need improvement on the proportion of male and female main characters, Norway had nearly three times the number of books that depict a male and female main character sharing the role of main character.  This could indicate a pattern of shared responsibilities between the sexes in Norwegian culture, as compared to the more patriarchal American society.   The United States had significantly more instances of fact books, such as letter and number recognition.The investigation of traditional role depiction of male and female characters showed additional significant differences between the two countries.  The United States literature depicted females in traditional roles more often and included lower instances of characters in non-traditional roles.  Norwegian books were most likely to depict characters in gender neutral roles.It does appear that the cultural norms of gender equity in Norway are reflected in the literature that is available to the children in their preschool programs and that American teachers may be able to learn how to more closely examine their own classroom libraries for bias.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Homework is a defining component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), however, few studies have examined homework adherence in youth CBT. Homework adherence was coded from audiotapes of school-based CBT for 50 depressed adolescents and evaluated as a predictor of proximal and distal treatment outcomes. Six therapist behaviors hypothesized to promote homework adherence were also coded from audiotapes of early sessions and examined in relation to subsequent homework adherence. Results showed no significant associations between client homework adherence and outcomes. Results also revealed several therapist behaviors to be associated with homework adherence in the context of planned moderator analyses. Adolescents considered at risk for non-adherence tended to show better adherence when therapists provided strong rationale for homework tasks, spent more time assigning homework in Session 1, and elicited client reactions and troubleshot obstacles in Session 2. Methodological and clinical implications are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study tells the personal stories of three academically successful students of Mexican descent. The goal of this study was to give a counter to the stereotypical deficit view of Hispanic students in the eyes of teachers, parents, and other students.The participants were three high school students of Mexican descent attending an urban high school in Colorado. The research question of this study allowed the participants to tell their story of what it was like to be a student. The research question was: What are the personal and academic stories of academically successful Mexican urban high school students?Through in-depth interviews the students shared both their positive and negative experiences. The narratives revealed that each student had similar experiences. The study identified common experiences that became themes and through an analysis of the data, nine findings were identified: (listed alphabetically) adversity, college, discrimination friends/peer pressure, language barriers, parent/family support, pride, responsibility, and teacher support.By telling the stories of three successful students of Mexican descent, light will be shed on what helped these students become successful. These stories give the reader the opportunity to meet three students of Mexican descent though their stories of what it was like to be a student and to see how they were able to succeed and counter the narrative to the more commonly known deficit views of Hispanic students.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The use of various polymer supports adhering phospholipid multibilayers to an internal reflection element have been investigated. The polymer supports studied range from polystyrene (PS), and 100 nm wide PS nanospheres to triethylaminated poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) (PVBC). The PS nanospheres showed the most promise as an adhesion layer since they appear to be the most robust with repeated washings. They also appear to stabilize their adjacent phospholipid multibilayer by increasing the lipid melting temperature. The triethylaminated DVBC also provided an increase of lipid melting temperature, but not quite to the same degree as the PS nanospheres. The cooperativity of such systems is much greater than without an adhesion layer. It is believed that in the case of PS nanospheres, a slight negative charge interacts with the polar head groups of the phospholipid multibilayer, thus leading to an increase in cooperativity. The triethylaminated DVBC is believed to interdigitate between the phospholipid molecules in a way such that the positively charged nitrogen atom interacts directly with the negatively charged phosphate group located on the phospholipid molecules, thus giving rise to its relatively high cooperativity and lower melting temperature than the uncharged polymers and nanobeads. The PS nanosphere polymer support was shown to be an effective platform for biosensors. Myoglobin based biosensors, using PS nanosphere supports, showed that myoglobin retains its native ligand binding ability.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>The Curricular and Instructional Implication for the Tacit Knowledge Exhibited while Creating a Forensic Craniofacial Reconstruction</dc:title>

  <dc:description>In our teaching careers,K-12 classroom teachers come to know that the way a given student connects the dots to comprehend a concept, lesson, or subject is not always (and most likely never is)in a straight linear fashion. The connections between the dots are defined as the student&apos;s personalized understanding (tacit knowledge/knowing)of concepts, lessons, and/or subjects. The student most likely did not perceive, process, and/or retain the concept, lesson, or subject in the manner it was taught to her or him. Teachers asking a student to explain how he or she arrived at an answer or knew the answer to a problem was &lt;bold&gt; right, &lt;bold&gt; are often told, &lt;italic&gt; &quot;It just came to me,&quot; &quot;I know it&apos;s right, but I just cannot explainit,&quot; or &quot;I just Know!&quot;&lt;italic&gt; These students do not fit the norms of schooling; this affects how they are seen and how they see themselves. They know there is a disconnection between what they know tacitly, and how thet are expected to explain what they know to prove that they know it. Theoretically this phenomenon is not accounted for in the literature of Epistemology or Curriculum and Instruction. The purpose of the study is to identify the essence of the tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiating process used by forensic artists, to interpretively shed light on its implications as a curricular and instructional model to help students who otherwise would be put unnecessarily at risk because of their tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiating process.In this qualitative interpretative exploratory study I use forensic craniofacial reconstruction as the lens through which I investigated the exhibits of tacit knowledge for its implication for curriculum and instruction. The study recruited volunteer members of ProjectEDAN as the study&apos;s participants. The research methodology combined &lt;italic&gt;Interview as Research &lt;italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Interpretative Biographies that served as case studies of my participants . the collected data served as part of the inductive evidence along with the three foundational premises from the theories of Polanyi,Denzin, and Miller@ Page as the bases for a Grounded Theory of Multistability to account for implications of tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiating  processes in curriculum and instruction.The major findings from the data highlight the participants&apos; philosophical foundational beliefs, the autotelic experiences in conjunction with their preferred method of working , their major epiphany (if any), and their reflections. The participants behaved as they perceive relative to the above categories as agents moving toward their equilibrium in the Complex Adaptive System of the facial reconstruction information processing problem-negotiating process. This is the milieu from where tacit knowledge emerges. The significance of the findings indicate the path for further investigation into tacit knowledge information processing problem-negotiation by entertaining a Multistability Theory of Curriculum and Instruction based on the Ideology of &quot;Do No Harm.&quot;</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The overarching purpose of this research was to provide theoretical and conceptual foundations for developing a competency-based curriculum for an interdisciplinary master&apos;s program in Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Specifically, the objective was to ascertain the competencies and courses that are relevant for developing a competency model for a service scientist and a curriculum blueprint for SSME. The study employed three rounds of the online Delphi survey to achieve the research objectives. The three rounds were used to identify, prioritize, and define competencies and courses. A panel of industry professionals and university faculty were invited to participate as experts. A total of 51, 40, and 39 respondents participated in Round 1, Round 2 and Round 3 survey respectively.Overall, a high degree of consensus was observed among the participants for the importance of competencies and courses, however, there were some differences noted by the disciplinary expertise and professional background of the respondents. Based on the consensus of the study participants, a final list of 10 competencies and 14 courses was generated. These competencies were used to develop a competency model and the courses were used to create a curriculum blueprint.The final 14 courses were categorized into four modules, Module 1: Contextual Foundation (Information &amp; Service Economy, Consumer Behavior, Leadership &amp; Organizational Behavior, Project Management); Module 2: Service Core (Service Innovation, Service Design, Service Operations and Supply Chain); Module 3(a): Engineering Concentration (Business Process Modeling, Service Engineering, Quality Management); Module 3(b): Management Concentration, Strategic Management, Service Marketing, Enterprise Systems) and; Module 4: Integrative Capstone (Business and Technology Integration).The final 10 competencies were categorized into three clusters; Cluster 1: Service Mindset (Needs assessment, Conceptualize service system, Problem-solving, Contextualize service science); Cluster 2: Integrative Competence (Business and technology integration, Interdisciplinary collaboration, Diversity orientation) and; Cluster 3: Meta-competence (Adaptability, Interpersonal communication, and Critical thinking).The results of this study may serve as a common language among stakeholders to prepare future service scientists or &quot;T-shaped&quot; professionals for the service economy. This study also contributed to the body of literature of competency-based curriculum development in higher education.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>For some years, Japan has pursued its own missile defense system in cooperation with the United States. The Japanese government claims that the missile defense (JMD) program is purely defensive and will not pose a threat to other countries. JMD may seem justified by North Korea&apos;s development of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. However, neighboring states regarded it as a sign of military ambition and revival of Japan&apos;s prewar militarism. The development and deployment of JMD could have grave implications for regional and global security. This dissertation focuses on these implications, domestic and international political considerations and the future direction of Japan&apos;s defense and security policy.After the Cold War, when the superpowers maintained strategic stability with massive offensive nuclear arsenals (mutual assured destruction--MAD), new threats from rogue states and terrorists have forced us to rethink the credibility of MAD. But attempts to build shields against nuclear ballistic missiles could trigger a new phase of the arms race pitting offensive vs. defensive capabilities. The author argues that defense must be emphasized in order to achieve stability and security (mutual defense emphasis--MDE). Characterization of JMD as truly defensive or not depends on theoretical and strategic viewpoints. The key is the distinction between defense and offense, and whether Japan will emphasize defense, and convince other states that its strategic intentions are really defensive.For the Japanese, with their dual realist and pacifist identities, JMD can be a tool of either realist military strategy or pacifist arms control. Japan should choose defensive realism, including MDE arms control, as a middle way that may eventually open a pacifist route to disarmament. With the world&apos;s most sophisticated technology and a tradition of pacifism, Japan is in a unique and advantageous position to promote arms control.In pursuit of JMD, the Japanese government should not only promote arms control and MDE--building missile shields against rogue and terrorist missile attacks or accidental or unauthorized launches, but also advance offensive arms reduction among major states. Japan can and must become a leader in such a shift toward a less dangerous world.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This project studies the ideational factors influencing Japanese foreign aid policy. It builds on previous research in political science on perception and foreign policy decision-making, Japanese political economy, economic and technological development, foreign aid, and in anthropology on perception, worldview, and international development.The main goal of the research is to answer the question of how Japan&apos;s historical experiences with technology, development, and foreign relations (and key leaders&apos; views of those areas) from 1850 to 1945 have influenced current aid policies. Second, the project aims to answer whether the Japanese development concepts of &quot;modernization,&quot; internationalization and translative adaptation accurately reflect Japan&apos;s own experience. Third, the project asks how spirituality and religion may be influencing current aid policies.In the research, I review key contexts of Japan&apos;s historical experience from 1850 to 1945 in several important areas. I also study the beliefs and worldviews (cognitive frameworks) of seven key Japanese leaders for the same period: Fukuzawa Yukichi, Mori Arinori, Ito Hirobumi, Yamagata Aritomo, Kato Hiroyuki, Yanagita Kunio, and Emperor Hirohito. I analyze these historical experiences and leaders&apos; views through analytical concepts and lenses from political science, anthropology, and economics, in three main areas: development, technology, and cognition.Among my key findings are that there is much continuity between Japan&apos;s prewar culture of politics and the postwar system, including examples and ideas, which shape the policy environment in which Japan&apos;s aid operates. Many of these are negative in nature, and some are ideas based on Japan&apos;s own development experience. Several key lessons emerge, including the importance of: 1) a strong civil society to prevent abusive politics for the achievement of Japan&apos;s national interests, whether in its prewar politics or the current aid system; 2) a strong, effective state for encouraging successful development; 3) Japan&apos;s development experience for other regions (if carefully applied); and 4) the concept of translative adaptation, the idea that each nation&apos;s development must be customized for its own conditions and experiences. I conclude that Japan needs better consideration of ground level factors in its assessments of ODA policy and international affairs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this dissertation is to consider the role of well-being in schooling.  Recent advances in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and medicine have led to a reexamination of the role of well-being in society.  There is a growing body of educational theory on the subject of well-being in schools that draws on these advances (Cohen, 2006; Noddings, 2003, 2006; Ruyter, 2004; Spring, 2007).  The few serious treatments on the role of well-being in education consider it from a theoretical perspective.  Few if any empirical research studies in the fields of Curriculum or Educational Psychology have been conducted that explore well-being in schools.  This dissertation will use the Science of Well-Being (C. R. Cloninger, 2004), an emerging theory unifying many fields of science, to take a new look at alternative education to explore how schools can attend to the well-being of children and society.  Specifically, this dissertation will investigate Krishnamurti Education using an arts-based qualitative research method: &lt;italic&gt;Educational Criticism and Connoisseurship&lt;italic&gt; (Eisner, 1998).I conducted research for roughly one month each at two Krishnamurti schools: the Oak Grove School in Ojai, California, and Brockwood Park in Hampshire, England.  I made long-term observations of 9 teachers at these two schools.  All told, this dissertation draws from 150 hours of observations and interviews with parents, teachers, administrators, and former students.  By studying these two schools, I answer the following research questions: 1) &lt;italic&gt;How is well-being related to schooling?&lt;italic&gt;  2) &lt;italic&gt;In two schools dedicated to the ideas of well-being and self-awareness, what specific strategies and pedagogies are used to help students cultivate self-awareness and well-being?&lt;italic&gt;  3) &lt;italic&gt;What is the significance of theories and practices aimed at increasing well-being for public schools in general?&lt;italic&gt;In an attempt to compare the educational approaches of the two schools, five underlying principles or dimensions emerged, which both schools share.  These five dimensions are: 1) &lt;italic&gt;Safety, Security, and Trust&lt;italic&gt;, 2) &lt;italic&gt;Order, Structure, and Activity&lt;italic&gt;, 3) &lt;italic&gt;Care, Affection, and Attention, 4) &lt;italic&gt;Intellect, Reasoning, and Meaning&lt;italic&gt;, and 5) &lt;italic&gt;The Sacred, Spirituality, and Religiosity&lt;italic&gt;.  These five dimensions of schooling are essential to consider in the development of well-being.  Krishnamurti schools, by attending to all of these dimensions, seek to reinvigorate communities of learning.  Instead of relying exclusively on techniques, ideology, and methods, they seek to create relationships within a community.The three themes that emerged from this study inform this dimensional framework by helping us to see how well-being can be encouraged in each of these five dimensions.  The three themes of &lt;italic&gt;love, freedom&lt;italic&gt;, and &lt;italic&gt;awareness&lt;italic&gt; emerged from the observations and interviews; they also appear frequently in Krishnamurti&apos;s writings and correspond with research from the Science of Well-Being on the practices that lead to greater well-being and the development of character.  The implications of this research for public education and teacher education are explored.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Colorado assesses approximately 98% of students enrolled in grades 3&amp;ndash10 in the area of mathematics. In 2005, 69,872 English Language Learners (ELLs) in grades 3&amp;ndash10 participated in the state content area assessments. In 2007, 88,060 ELLs participated in the state content area assessments. With this dramatic growth in the ELL population in the state of Colorado and elsewhere in the nation, ensuring that ELLs have access to comprehensible materials on state assessments is of paramount importance. Accommodations provide access for students based on their individual needs. Likewise, assessment items designed and or revised using the principles of plain language and universal design increase access to the content area information in assessments. Colorado&apos;s work in plain language revision of Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) items has been extensive.Using statewide CSAP data for 2005 and 2007, this study examined how mathematics assessment items, once revised for plain language, performed compared to the original, unrevised version of the item. Access for English Language Learners was a focal point for this study. Plain language revision was evaluated for its effects on item difficulty, item discrimination, DIF and DOK.DOK ratings from 2005 and 2007 were compared using Chi&amp;ndashsqaure. One sample t&amp;ndashtests were used to examine the differences in DIF and item difficulty (p&amp;ndashvalue), as well as item discrimination for ELLs and Non&amp;ndashELLs comparing the 2005 non&amp;ndashrevised items with the 2007 revised items. Unrevised items were used as controls. Revised items were classified by type of linguistic change. Each type of change was examined using ANOVA to determine if a specific type of change effected differences in DIF and item difficulty.While results indicate little if any difference in item performance at individual grade levels, overall LEP performance on revised items was higher than on non&amp;ndashrevised items, a change in performance not present for non-ELLs. This may indicate that plain language revision continues to hold promise as a best practice for item development. As an accommodation, however, it appears that plain language revision alone may not be sufficient to ensure access to assessment items for ELLs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In the past 30 years, mentoring has gained perhaps the largest recognition of any phenomenon related to career success. Much of the current research that has explored mentoring relationships has been conducted in fields other than communication studies, although better communication is often the recommended solution to improve mentoring. The majority of research has focused on the outcomes of mentoring relationships, rather than the process of mentoring relationships. Mentoring has also not been studied through a relational dialectics perspective. This study explored the communication dynamics within mentoring relationships through a relational dialectics theoretical lens. The study utilized multiple methods including prompted joint conversations as well as individual interviews. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis (Owen, 1984). Significant findings include eight dialectical tensions constituted in mentoring relationships: openness-with and closedness-with, openness-to and closedness-to, integration and separation, stability and change, equality and hierarchy, individual goals and organizational goals, personal and professional, and structure and flexibility. Five management strategies were also discovered: spiraling inversion, segmentation, reaffirmation, balance, and denial. The identification of these tensions and management strategies led to a greater understanding of mentoring relationships, built on existing research to highlight the complexity in mentoring relationships, as well as supported the conceptualization of relational dialectics theory.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study explores the communicative dynamic that occurs between Denver police officers, and citizens of the African-American community, during traffic stops characterized as &quot;Driving While Black.&quot; Thirty four interviews were conducted regarding this study. Derived from the interviews were transcribed narratives, which were examined through the use of narrative analysis and various theoretical frameworks. The narrative analysis and theoretical frameworks provided a new lens for exploring the police/citizen communicative dynamic, and a foundation for additional communication research between police officers and the African-American community.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study examined the role of cultural indicators in moderating  the influence of perceived partner responses and relationship satisfaction on pain severity and depressive symptomatology among a sample of 62 married and cohabiting Mexican American men, the majority of whom were first generation Mexican Americans, with chronic back and/or neck pain. The cultural indicators were not found to act as moderators in the analyses that involved pain severity and depressive symptomatology as outcome variables. Nevertheless, this study&apos;s findings are an important initial step in understanding the relationship dynamics among an understudied population with chronic pain and raise many important questions to be pursued in future research. The cultural indicator &lt;italic&gt;simpatia&lt;/italic&gt; was found to moderate the association between perceived solicitous partner responses and relationship satisfaction, indicating that for those valuing &lt;italic&gt;simpatia&lt;/italic&gt;, solicitous responses may be seen to enhance the relational bond between the couple. Furthermore, perceived punishing partner responses were positively associated with pain severity and depressive symptomatology, indicating that these responses are likely seen as negative and may run against that which Mexican American males are expecting from their female partners, even when they are displayed within the context of a relationship that is generally a source of satisfaction. Findings also indicated that Mexican American men who were more acculturated, had been in the U.S. for a greater number of generations, or were lower in &lt;italic&gt;simpatia&lt;/italic&gt;, had worse pain and mood-related outcomes than those who were on the other side of the continuum of these cultural indicators. Despite its limitations, the present study was the first to examine the role of perceived partner responses on pain severity and depressive symptomatology within a cultural framework. Future studies conducted on larger, more diverse samples of Mexican American participants who fall along the entire acculturation spectrum, with the use of face-to-face interviews and behavioral observations, in addition to better paper and pencil measures than those used in the present study, as well as qualitative studies that focus specifically on first generation Mexican Americans, are needed to further examine the role of cultural indicators on the pain experience of married and cohabiting Mexican Americans.</dc:description>

  <dc:title>A GLOBAL EDUCATION TRANSITION: COMPUTER SIMULATION OF ALTERNATIVE PATHS TO UNIVERSAL BASIC EDUCATION</dc:title>

  <dc:description>As an acknowledgment of the critical role of education in realizing other development targets, the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of the United Nations include education in a framework of development targets. The MDG targets for education include achieving universal primary education and gender parities in all levels of education by 2015.Recent global campaigns have added to the momentum of the rapid progress of educational expansion, which began in roughly the 1960s. Countries with universal or near universal participation and completion in elementary education have started to look beyond primary, towards free and compulsory basic education- education up to lower secondary- for all their citizens.This dissertation will explore the progress towards, and viability of, meeting current and potential global targets at various stages of basic education. It will answer questions such as: What path is the world on in terms of meeting the MDG goal of universal primary education? Which regions and countries are at risk of falling short of that target? How will lower-secondary education unfold in different regions of the world? Will there be any disparity between boys and girls as the countries expand their primary and lower-secondary education? What needs to be done to meet the current MDG for universal primary education and to move the global system towards universal lower secondary at the global, regional, and country level?To find the answers, we developed a long-term educational forecasting model that represents the student and financial flows through the different levels of a formal educational system from primary to tertiary. The model is integrated within the broader International Futures model and represents the economic and demographic forces shaping the supply and demand of education. The broader International Futures system models the impacts of education on societal variables like fertility, productivity, and income, thus creating a feedback loop.According to our analyses, most of the developing countries will continue their educational expansion at a speed faster than the speed that the developed countries showed when they were at a comparable stage of development. However, some of the developing regions will still be far away from universal participation or gender parity in primary and lower secondary, largely due to the low initial condition in these regions. 	Forecasts from the base case of our educational model show the pace of progress will not be sufficient to meet the education MDGs. Two of the world regions, sub-Saharan Africa and South and West Asia, might not be able to enroll all their children in elementary schools by 2015. These two and one other UNESCO region, the Arab States, do not see universal lower secondary education in the horizon even at 2020. In the base case, all UNESCO regions but two will reach or be close to gender parity in primary education by 2015. While the Arab States will be close to parity by 2030, the sub-Saharan African index will not reach parity until mid-century. Latin America and the Caribbean, on the other hand, might experience a reverse gender bias favored towards girls by 2015, but will re-approach parity later.Lowering population growth will lessen the demand pressure in these countries and thus help them achieve better rates of participation in basic education. A better economy will help them spend more on education and thus get better results.Exploration of the recent growth patterns in access to and progress in education convinced us that there is  room for some acceleration of the progress in these areas. We have combined these findings to develop an aggressive but realistic normative scenario, where growth targets in educational flow rates, rather than an absolute coverage, are pursued.Even with the improved results from the normative scenario, the world is unlikely to meet the 2015 MDG targets. However, the sub-Saharan African region, as a whole, would be sufficiently close to the target of universal primary education by 2020. All other regions meet the MDG of universal primary under the normative scenario, with South and West Asia just barely making it. Under the normative scenario, all but one world region, sub-Saharan Africa, reach 95 percent or higher gross participation rate in lower secondary by 2020. It is almost mid-century by the time sub-Saharan Africa reaches close to universal lower secondary.Substantial progress in terms of gender parity will occur under the normative scenario despite the goal being explicitly pursued under the normative scenario. As girls in developing regions catch up with boys these regions reach close to gender parity in primary education around 2015. By 2020, exact parity is obtained in all regions. While the reverse gender parity extant in regions like Latin America and the Caribbean will start to slide back starting in the 2020s, a similar reverse parity starts to show up in sub-Saharan Africa around that time.The transition to universal basic education is important for human development. It will take considerable time and efforts to complete the transition. While it is useful to coordinate the global efforts in making the transition, it is also important to take into account the differences across regions and nations in setting realistic targets and goalposts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act changed assessment for English Language Learners (ELLs). Under the law, states must validly assess ELLs&apos; English Language Proficiency (ELP) and content knowledge. The law shed light on the achievement of ELLs while also creating challenges for states in validating state assessment and accountability systems. Test accommodations are used for ELLs to reduce threats to test score validity and measure academic achievement as accurately and fairly as possible. Since ELLs are working towards proficiency in English, they face linguistic and socio-cultural barriers under the confines of large scale assessment. A limited body of research regarding accommodations for ELLs exists, but has inconclusive findings that do not factor in student background variables. This study examined to what extent linguistic accommodation led to improvement in test performance of ELLs using ELP scores from the Colorado English Language Acquisition Assessment (CELApro) and Mathematics scores from the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) along with student background variables. The results of this study suggest that Translated Oral Scripts seemed to make the biggest difference for all grade levels in terms of association with higher CSAP performance. Students using Word-to-Word Dictionaries also showed increased performance for grades eight and ten. Grades three through seven were not included for this accommodation because of small sample sizes. Oral Scripts and Teacher Read Directions were associated with positive score increases for some grades and negative score drops for others. Students with lower levels of English proficiency tended to benefit more from receiving accommodations than students with higher proficiency. Analyzing the accommodations by grade also revealed differential accommodation effects. Third grade students receiving Translated Oral Scripts had higher CSAP scores than their non-accommodated peers, those using regular Oral Scripts benefitted slightly, while the effects of Teacher Read directions and Extended Timing appear to be worse than receiving No Accommodation for this sample. In grade ten, it did not matter what accommodations students received--none seemed to be associated with student performance.While the analyses showed that for the most part Teacher Read Directions, Extended Timing, and Oral Scripts were not significantly associated with Fluent-English Proficient (FEP) performance, it is unfortunate that the student samples receiving Translated Oral Scripts and Word-to-Word Dictionaries were insufficient in size to allow their inclusion. The FEP results may be due to the fact that FEPs no longer benefit from accommodations since they have a high level of ELP. Considering the significant role that assessment results have in guiding decisions about individuals and organizations, it is crucial to continue examining how to fairly assess ELLs while using systematic research-based practices.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Increasingly, colleges and universities in the United States are adapting toward amodel of behavior that incorporates issues of sustainability. This adaptation inuniversities and in society has implications on the organizational and nation-statelevel, the very core of which may serve to reshape the social contract between thetwo. In addition to supplying a strong counter-hegemonic argument that alters thecompetitive economic agenda-setting paradigm, this study serves as a tripartitecomparative case study analysis of university adaptation toward socialsustainability. By employing a social capital lens to understanding socialsustainability in higher education, this study seeks to examine the relationshipbetween higher education, sustainability, and the nation-state.The conceptualframework of this analysis will draw on Putnam&apos;s concept of social capital, in theeffort to understand the relationship between higher education, sustainability, andsocial capital as well as what a sustainability paradigm could mean in terms of a&quot;new&quot; social contract.The methodology of this study is exploratory and aimed at understandinguniversity adaptation in three ways: first, elements of organization andadministration aimed at advancing sustainability; second, teaching and researchefforts that have been established within a sustainability frame; and third,community and outreach efforts that examines the role of the university in itslocal environment as well as the work toward public service. The specificmethodology employed can be categorized as comparative case study (Yin, 2003).To validate findings, data is triangulated via a between-methods design andcollected through: qualitative survey, contextual content analysis, andcomparative discourse analysis respectively (Jaeger, 1988).  The result iseffectively a 3 x 3 mixed methods design so that each individual case studyemploys each of the three methodologies in order to provide a rich description ofthe social sustainability phenomena and offer data for comparative discourseanalysis.Findings reveal three distinct strands amongst the case studies in the analysisof sustainability discourse. Results show the importance of the role of,organizational context, personal approach of the chief sustainability agent, andorganizational saga in contributing to adaptation. In this way, sustainabilityapproaches and the priority and university adaptation differed. These threeapproaches can be described as: an energy/operations/facilities perspective, aresearch and academic-focused perspective, and a humanistic-grassrootsapproach.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Korean military wives have been symbolized as &quot;dirty,&quot; &quot;nothing,&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; by Koreans, Korean Americans, and their American families. They also experience same level of oppression and discrimination within Korean American congregations. In Korea, the women suffered poverty, sexual violence, and Confucian gender discrimination. They have also experienced racial and sexual oppression, intercultural familial conflicts and violence, and identity crisis in America.All of those experiences are caused the sense of not belonging of Korean military wives.The sense of not belonging and desperation can be explained well by Andrew Sung Park&apos;s theology of han. The theology of han shows the han of the women can be resolved only as the offender are willing to stand in the solidarity with Korean military wives. Asian feminist theologians point out that Asian women experience God as life-giving power and ultimately seek to the full humanity in the image of God.Meanwhile, liberation psychology focuses on the socio-political aspects of human psychology. It argues that the primary purpose of psychology in Latin America should make Latin Americans critically confront of the oppressive and dominant social and political realities.Conscientization plays a critical role in developing my thesis. To practice of resistance and transformation, the process of conscientization is essential both to Korean American congregations and to Korean military wives. To Korean Americancongregations, they need to critically reflect upon their privilege, power, and unjust socio-cultural and religious structures. Korean military wives need to confront their hanful life realities and proclaim their full humanity in the image of God.Under the communal contextual approach of pastoral theology and care, I propose three pastoral strategies of Korean military wives: (1) Korean American congregations should be authentic resisting and transforming community, which is grounded in God&apos;s justice and life-giving power. (2) Korean American congregations need the power of de-powering and de-centering of power systems toward converting power abuse into creative power. Korean military wives also need to rediscover and develop pre-existing but unnoticed power or capacity within themselves. (3) Korean American congregations work together with Korean military wives to resist social injustice through transforming actions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Victim blame can have detrimental effects on victims&apos; coping with traumatic events. The current study examined contextual (i.e., victim-observer ingroup membership and safety of the environment) and individual difference (i.e., world beliefs, trauma exposure, and cognitive semantic associations) factors in relation to victim blame. Ingroup membership predicted greater character praise in females, while outgroup membership predicted greater praise in males. Victim praise was also greater when the environment was safe versus dangerous. Stronger beliefs about the manageability of the world marginally predicted greater victim blame, while stronger benevolent world beliefs predicted less victim blame and less character derogation. Further, the number of traumatic event types reported by participants was positively related to character praise and negatively related to derogation. Histories of exposure to traumas high in betrayal predicted greater character derogation. Using an implicit semantic priming task to examine the automatic semantic associations between victim and derogation concepts, victim-to-derogation priming was related to less victim blame.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Accurate, in situ measurement of airborne particles is critical in understanding the global atmosphere. An airborne instrument is designed to sample and measure the aerodynamic diameter of particles in the size range of 1-30 mm. Knowledge of the aerodynamic size of a particle includes the impact of unknown variables such as shape, size and density of a particle. Particles of the same aerodynamic diameter have the same trajectory and settling velocity in air, regardless of their actual size, density or shape. Knowing the time a particle resides in air can improve the climate models substantially.The developed instrument consists of a low turbulence inlet and a laser-Doppler velocimeter to sample and measure the super-micron particles all in one unit. Air enters the inlet at true air speed of the aircraft, which is a relatively high speed in the range of 100-200 ms-1. The low turbulence inlet reduces the air speed to 5-10 ms-1 in a short distance without generation of additional turbulence. It uses boundary layer suction through a porous diffuser to remove a substantial amount of air that is responsible for turbulence generation and particle loss in deposition to the inlet walls. Reduction of turbulence makes it possible to model and solve the flows inside the inlets and calculate the particle trajectories using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools.A new technique is developed to determine the size distribution of particles based on the motion of particles and measurement of the particles&apos; velocity. Velocimetric measurement of particle size is achieved by slowing the velocity of the flow that is carrying the particles and measuring the velocity of the particles in response to this change. Larger particles have higher tendency to continue at a higher speed, while smaller particles tend to follow the air stream lines. A laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measures the velocity of the particles as they pass through the viewing volume of the velocimeter. The aerodynamic diameter of the particles and their concentration is determined from the velocity measurements.Accurate determination of particle size distribution at the location of measuring sensor does not guarantee the accuracy of the ambient size distribution. The modification of number of particle due to particle loss, enhancement, and particles bouncing off the leading edge of the inlet is considered to accurately measure the ambient size distribution of particles.This research work also focuses on quantifying the effects of particle enhancement in the low turbulence inlet used in ACE-Asia sampling inlet and the deposition of particles in transport through the bends of ACE-Asia and NOAA inlets. The effect of force of gravity on deposition efficiency of particles has also been analyzed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In this study I analyze the problem of land degradation in Zimbabwe&apos;s Communal Areas (CAs) from the viewpoint of the Shona of Zimbabwe with the aim to formulate a land conservation ethic that motivates people in CAs to promote ecological stability.  The Shona in CAs are proximate agents as well as victims of environmental degradation.  The imperative to survive in a situation characterized by drastic inequalities in the allocation of land and an exploitative global economic system, forces them to engage in unsustainable land use practices.  Land conservation policies in Zimbabwe marginalize Shona values and norms, especially as they relate to land.  Against this background, the study advances the thesis that the problem of land degradation in CAs is primarily social, involving our right relationship with nature and with each other.  Therefore, technical approaches to the problem must be complemented by an ethic informed by Shona religio-culture whose main components are African Traditional Religions and Cultures and African Christianity.The study employs the hermeneutical circle of liberation theology as a paradigm by which to do ethics.  The paradigm follows the three methodological concepts of liberation theology, especially as Clodovis and Leornado Boff expound it.  These are: the socio-analytical mediation and the historical-analytical mediation; the hermeneutical mediation and the practical mediation.  In this method, the oppressed (the Shona), are the key ethical category for assessing all ethical behavior.  The paradigm begins with the lived experiences of oppressive social situations and proceeds to formulate a system of ethics aimed at changing the oppressive situation faced by the oppressed in CAs.The study concludes that a land conservation ethic that effectively addresses the problem of land degradation in CAs is a liberative ethic that comes out of Shona people&apos;s experience of oppression.  It is an ethic that seeks to remove conditions that degrade the land and dehumanize people in CAs.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this investigation was to examine pragmatic language engagement and social competence in middle school children with and without reading disability during dyadic interaction. Engagement was defined in terms of degree of information and responsiveness provided by each partner. Analyses indicated reading disabled students differ from non-reading disabled students in terms of pragmatic language engagement. However, this was true only in terms of degree of responsiveness. Students with reading disability employed similar degrees of pragmatic language engagement in terms of information to those of their non-disabled peers. Further, no relationships were found between social competence and either type of pragmatic language engagement, responsiveness or information. Implications for the multifaceted assessment of pragmatic language and social competence and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>In recent years the relationship between Caribbean states and China has intensified. This dissertation argues that the Caribbean&apos;s increased engagement with China is an important component of their economic adjustment strategy that was necessitated after changes in the orientation of the international economic system that they must operate within, particularly in relation to the loss of trade preferences and the sharp decline in official development assistance.Despite the seemingly homogenous nature of these Caribbean states there is in fact significant foreign policy variation seen vis-à-vis engagement with China. Some Caribbean states have consistently recognized China, while others have vacillated between recognition of China and Taiwan. The source of this variation lies in differences in endowment of resources that are of strategic importance to China. The more resource-endowed countries demonstrate more foreign policy consistency while the resource-poor countries have exhibited a less consistent foreign policy towards China.The dissertation also explores the extent to which the relationship with China is beneficial for these states. It will be shown that despite the lack of explicit conditionalities accompanying Chinese aid and loans, there are important implicit conditionalities such as the awarding of contracts to Chinese firms and the importation of Chinese laborers that thwart the potential benefits accruing to Caribbean states from this relationship with China.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Colorado Student Assessment Program, or CSAP, is the Colorado standardized testing program that measures student progress in reading, writing, and mathematics for all public schools in the state of Colorado. The scores vary across the state between districts, neighborhoods, and schools. Is there any pattern to this variation in scores? Is there one primary factor that explains this variation? At which scale are factors most significant? This project uses GIS to map the CSAP results and to correlate CSAP scores with neighborhood demographic variables such as income, race, educational attainment, as well as school related variables such as teacher salary and percent free lunch. The hypothesis that school scores are influenced by the characteristics defining the neighborhoods in which the students live challenges the theory that educational success is independent of these social factors. The most explanatory variable used in the analyses was percent free lunch. The higher the percentage of students that qualify for free lunch in a school, the lower the average CSAP scores for that grade at all scales of analyses. The school scale provided the strongest correlations between the CSAP scores and percent free lunch.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The research presented in this paper seeks to further explore the spatial dimensions of affordable rental housing shortages in the western United States by examining the degree to which a shortage of affordable rental housing exists in Los Angeles-Long Beach, California; Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona; Portland-Vancouver, Oregon-Washington; San Diego, California; and San Francisco- Oakland, California. Following Nelson, American Housing Survey metropolitan area micro- data is used to quantify the number of affordable rental housing units relative to the number of renter households within defined income strata to answer the following questions: what is the estimated shortage of affordable rental housing for extremely low income, very low income, and low income households in the study areas; how have the shortages of affordable rental housing changed in these metropolitan areas over time; how do the estimates vary between metropolitan areas; what do these results imply about the housing opportunities facing these populations; and how well do regional estimates•approximate the magnitude of shortages of affordable rental housing for extremely low, very low, and low income renters in the metropolitan areas studied? The results indicate that the affordable rental housing shortage is most severe in the tight southern Californian housing markets due to the acute shortage of units for extremely low income households and very low income renters. The analysis also revealed that shortages of affordable rental housing are worsening in Portland-Vancouver and Phoenix-Mesa. Further, the metro areas displayed different results in terms of whether shortages were more or less severe in their central cities over suburbs and in terms of the lower in some populations impacted. Using logistic regression, it was also shown that in San Diego extremely low income renters have a higher likelihood of occupying affordable rental housing if they receive some form of rental assistance</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The research conducted has three main components. The first component is an updating of the &quot;Southwest Effect&quot; as observed by Air Transport World (1998), Dresner, Lin, and Windle (1996), and Southwest (1999). This updating illustrates that when Southwest enters a market there is a significant increase in pass-engers carried in the majority of the markets and a significant decrease in the average fare paid by travelers in the markets examined. The second goal of this work demonstrates how Southwest Airlines has created a &quot;Wal...;MartEffect&quot; on surrounding airports when entering a market. While this &quot;Wal-Mart Effect&quot; is not a strong as the original &quot;Southwest Effect&quot;, the research shows that the carrier indeed has an effect on enplanements and fares especially in multi-airport regions. The final objective studied in this research is the effect of the airline in changing metropolitan linkages. The increase in passengers attributed to the Southwest Effect lead to movements within the hierarchies of the cities studied. One of the biggest movers was Baltimore, which saw an increase in ranking in almost all of the cases studied. There was a general increase in the rankings of Southwest served cities when compared to non-Southwest served airports. - This research shows that Southwest Airlines does indeed have a profound effect on both the number of passengers traveling between airports and the average fare the passenger pays. It also shows that the carrier has the ability to strengthen the interaction between two airports with the type of service that it provides.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The spatial components of Colorado migration and population growth are examined for the 1955-1995 period using data from the Internal Revenue Service, Bureau of Census, and other sources. An analysis is made of relationships between population growth, natural increase, and migration, factors associated with interstate migration to Colorado, internal and external flows within metropolitan hierarchies, and economic and amenity variables. Statistical methods and spatial analysis by mapping are employed. Results are evaluated for conformance with migration theories including Ravenstein&apos;s laws, the gravity model, and especially Zelinsky&apos;s &quot;mobility transition hypothesis. The relationship between migration flows and patterns of urban growth is·discussed. Variations in net migration are found to be more important than variations in natural·increase in explaining variations in population growth. Sources of migrants to Colorado have shifted from the Midwest to the West and South. The gravity model factors, population and distance, are effective in explaining the volume of inmigration. There is a weak relationship between unemployment rates and net migration. Colorado&apos;s metropolitan areas and mountain resort towns serve as the main ports of entry for migrants from other states. Metropolitan size is unimportant in accounting for mig+atioq rate~ except within certain urban hie+archies. There is a slight downward movement within metropolitan hierarchies for external migrants, and a slight upward movement within Colorado. The Boyer and Savageau quality of life index is ineffective as a predictor of net migration direction. The recreational nature of counties and private/public land mix are seen as somewhat important for migrant destinations, but less so for internal migrants. Distance to specific portions of Colorado is the most important factor for migrants from different U.S. Census regions with some noted exceptions. Net flows of internal migrants are primarily directed toward suburban counties and some counties which are contiguous with metropolitan areas. Highest internal migration rates are intrametropolitan followed by intra-nonmetropolitan. The Zelinsky model still has utility, but should be viewed in the light of urban deconcentration.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Rocky Mountain region presents a number of problems for climatologists and meteorologists seeking to analyze weather and climate trends. The complex terrain modifies atmospheric circulation patterns and can both initiate and alter storm systems. Frequency, intensity, and duration of storm events are in tum affected by upper atmospheric circulation patterns. This research examines relations between (1) the PNA teleconnection index, (2) upper atmospheric pressure patterns, (3) storm-track preferences, and (4) frequency of cyclonic activity during seasons of exceptional winter precipitation. Map pattern analysis of standardized winter season precipitation indices calculated for each climate division inthe Rocky Mountain region yield 6 anomalous winter patterns. Composite maps of the 500-mbar surface are classified to determine modes of synoptic feature variability during the winter seasons analyzed. The significance of cyclone frequencies and the PNA index on precipitation anomaly patterns are determined through regression of the cyclone frequency and PNA indices against both divisional and regional precipitation indices. Finally, dominant storm track patterns are analyzed with respect to the anomalous precipitation patterns identified. Above-average winter precipitation patterns in the Northern region are associated with a zonal circulation regime, as indicated by a negative PNA index value and a ridge-trough-ridge configuration in the 500-mbar surface. The anomalous flow regime established by this reverse PNA synoptic pattern increases the frequency of extratropical cyclones breaching the west coast, and shifts the mean storm track such that storms enter the mountainous divisions of Idaho, western Montana, and northwestern Wyoming with little impediment. Anomalous precipitation patterns in the Southern region show no statistical significance to the frequency of cyclonic activity. Meridional circulation, as indicated by a positive PNA index value and a trough-ridge-trough synoptic pattern are strongly associated with above-average precipitation regimes in the Southern region. The increase component of anomalous flow from the subtropical Pacific Ocean and the southward displacement of the mean storm track around the Aleutian low result in an increase in winter storm system dynamics, rather than an increased frequency of storm events.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Closed topographic depressions are widespread across the Colorado Plains with maximum densities in areas of fixed Quaternary sand dunes. A purposive sample of 548 depressions selected from maps of the 1° x 2° and 7.5-minute topographic series was described by five variables measuring the bipolar attributes elongate-circular, compact-irregular, shallow-deep, small-large, and simple-complex. Submission of the resulting data matrix to a hierarchical clustering algorithm discriminated the main genetic classes already identified subjectively, although with some misallocation. The analysis gave no new genetic insights and split some natural groupings that span a morphological continuum but share a common genesis. These limitations reflect deficiencies in specifying the morphological diversity of the sample as well as the mechanical nature of numerical classification procedures. Most sample depressions are primary or secondary eolian forms, ranging from small, regular depositional hollows on sand and loess, through deeper, more elongate blowouts, to large and highly irregular features comprising coalescent interdune flats and corridors. The largest features are found across early Pleistocene pediments undergoing dissection by north-bank tributaries of the South Platte and Arkansas Rivers and preserved by beheading of the pediment drainage. They result from solution-subsidence associated with Permian evaporites and from eolian disruption of broad shallow valleys comprising the original pediment drainage. Smaller stellate forms in central Washington County result from disruption of the incised High Plains drainage by loess drifts.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The great size of the earth and the many geographical elements upon it require that geographic research utilize a reductionism that demands comprehensive considerations of scale. These elements compose a range of geographical focus within the experience of man, and in keeping with the processes of nature. The geographer has no laboratory in the manner of other scientists, but must rely on the map, and more recently upon remote sensors, as a means of making portions of the landscape amenable for study. These also supplement his field work, which is affected by the dimensions of the landscape, and his limited powers of observation. Geography is a science of areal variation which requires extensive study of area. Man&apos;s perception and conceptualization of area have important implications of scale. In field work, the geographer operates at a scale of reality (1:1). The sources with which he supplements field work are at various scales. Perception and conceptualization are processes, of both physiological and mental nature, peculiar to the individual; but the geographer is a trained individual and can give meaning to the areal variations at appropriately selected scales. Geographers have used the term, scale, with several meanings. Map scale is the most common and best understood. However, there are other scales necessary for the measurement of areal variation. In this respect, it is frequently necessary for a special scale to be devised for the individual research problem. Geographers have also employed the term, scale, with the connotation of area, and to refer to a point on a scale. The important thing is that the scale measures what it says that it will measure, and that it is not in violation of the isomorphism between the real objects and the number system. It is also important that subsequent mathematical operations performed upon measured quantities, be in accord with the order of the scale(nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio), with which their measure has been determined. In geography, it is clear that the term scale means measurement, and more specifically, the preciseness of measurement. There is also a need to distinguish between generalization and measurement, as the former belongs to hypothesis and theory, and the latter to empirical observation. The selection of scale for a particular geographic research problem, might be thought of as a position of observation within a cone, inverted over the study area (cone of resolution). The choice of scale available is almost infinite, and the geographer has to rely on intuition and experience for selection. Actually he works at multiscale considerations, being governed by data sources and the nature of his problem. Examination of current research articles reveals that most geographic research is being conducted at small scales(63%) while only 8% is at large scale. In aerial photo interpretation scale plays an important part in resolution, detection, and identification, but the mechanical systems and physical conditions involved are the governing factors. Thematic and special purpose mapping have extreme scale considerations centered around the expression of areal data as point data. This is basically a matter of the extent to which one wishes to conceptualize or think abstractly, but concept cannot continue to be built upon concept without eventual verification with reality.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The problem addressed by this study was as follows: Are University of Denver freshmen persisters, voluntary withdrawals, and academic dismissals different on entrance variables? If they are different, can the differences be explained, and is it possible to predict group membership? Of the freshmen who entered the University of Denver in the fall of 1979, 164 persisters, 140 voluntary withdrawals, and 49 academic dismissals were compared on 14 pre-enrollment variables routinely collected in institutional files. The data were analyzed using stepwise discriminant function analysis in order to test group differences, the contribution of variables to those differences, and the predictive accuracy of a model built on pre-enrollment variables. The analyses performed showed that persisters and voluntary withdrawals were so similar on the variables utilized that a more meaningful analysis of the contribution of variables to group discrimination, and a more powerful prediction model, should use the more homogeneous group definition of the combination of (persisters + voluntary withdrawals) versus academic dismissals. The most important findings of this study were: 1. The similarity of freshmen persisters and voluntary withdrawals on entrance characteristics. 2. The interaction effects of &quot;distance away from home,&quot; and the extremely different profiles of commuter and non-commuter academic dismissals at the University of Denver. 3. The importance of financial aid, student age, and socioeconomic characteristics to separate academic dismissals at the University of Denver from other freshmen, over academic variables expected to hold much stronger discriminating power, such as high school rank and standardized test scores. This finding challenged the criteria for admissions traditionally used by the university. 4. The possibility of building a fairly strong prediction model for academic dismissal at the University of Denver, based only on pre-enrollment data. This study developed a prediction model that, when separating academic dismissals from other freshmen, yielded overall percentages of correct classifications of 82.8% for the sub-sample of commuters, and 76.7% for non-commuters. These results allow the practical use of the model to build a &quot;high-risk&quot; group in order to apply retention, orientation, and counseling strategies on potential academic dismissals.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>On June 16, 1965, intense rainfall triggered numerous mass movements in Douglas County, Colorado.The purpose of this study was to examine these mass movements and determine the:(1) spatial distribution, (2) specific form and type, (3) contributing environmental factors, and (4) potential hazardous areas.Geometric and environmental field measurements were made on 45 scars.Geometric form measurements were used as the basis for the development of morphometric indices. The indices used were:depth (head)/length, depth (head)/width (source area), width (source area)/ length (source area), depth (head)/depth (side), depth (head)/total length of scar, length (source area)/total length of scar, width of transport zone/width (source area), shape, and volume.Correlation analysis was used to identify relations among the morphometric indices. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups of scars with similar morphometric characteristics. Each group of scars was then examined to identify environmental factors and hazard potential.Results of correlation analysis indicated two statistically significant relationships. Negative correlations exist between: (1) L/Lt and wc/W, and (2) D/Lt and wc/W. Both of these relationships suggest an association between the morphometry of the scars and the flow characteristics of the moving mass. In effect, channelization is related to both the displacement and volume of material from the source area. A long, narrow scar is produced by a moving viscous mass following existing drainageways downslope. With cluster analysis, four groups of scars were obtained that share similar morphometric characteristics. Group 1 was characterized by high L/Lt index values which suggested that sliding was the initial type of movement from the source area.Group 2 contained only one scar and was subsequently excluded from further analysis. Group 3 included scars with low values for the D/Lt index, suggesting that flowage was the operating process as material moved from the source area. Group 4 was comprised of scars exhibiting high values for the D/Ds index.This suggests rotational movement (slumping) of material within the source area. With each group, the material was apparently transformed into a flow as it moved through the transport zone. Environmental factors examined included topography, surface materials, and vegetation. A majority of the 45 scars were located on slopes with a northwest to northeast orientation. The only two associations observed between surface materials and types of movement occurred with groups 1 and 4. The scars in group 1 (slides) had a shear surface of gravelly-sand underlain by a distinct clay layer. Sixty percent of the scars in group 4 (slumps) occurred in surficial material thicker than five feet. No association between vegetation type or ground cover was observed.A hierarchy of hazardous areas for this type of mass movements was recognized.All areas beneath mesas and buttes possess some hazard, including the gently inclined areas at the base of the slopes. The next most hazardous locations include areas adjacent to drainage-ways at the base of slopes.At such locations, the greater the relief between the slope base and upland surfaces, the more extensive is the potentially affected area.The most hazardous situation occurs in those areas near the base of a north-facing slope and adjacent to drainageways.From this study, it can be concluded that a morphometric examination of mass movements has significant potential as a method of analyses for mass movements. Types of movement, factors contributing to movement and potentially affected areas can be suggested. However, more work is needed with various types of movements and in other locations before the full potential can be established.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Only in the past two or three decades has there been voiced any real sense of alarm arising from the extraordinary increase in population.In that same time period an increasing awareness of our nation&apos;s finite land space has been penetrating the minds of citizens and government officials. One consequence of this intensifying situation is the emergence of a group of professionals who desire to manage land use decisions in such a way as to present a balance between the numerous and often divergent uses of the finite land surface. These professionals are land use planners. As a result of several factors, state, county, and municipal governments have agencies of one sort or another which are charged with the responsibility for preparing comprehensive land use plans and, in some instances, for overseeing the proper functioning of the plans. These factors are numerous but one may cite federal initiatives in the form of legislation and financial incentives as examples and, at lower levels, the apparent competition for land use in the rural-urban arena. The inexorable growth of population with the expectable intensification of land use has prompted a concurrent—although somewhat tardy—evolution of comprehensive land use plans. The present stage in the evolution reflects a recognition of the scope and seriousness of the need for truly effective land use management. When one considers land use management, the concern is for planning the best use of land area; that is the spatial component.One notable shortcoming persists in the latest comprehensive plans; they include neither a procedure for evaluating the spatial component nor a stated intent to evaluate that critical component—particularly at the county level.If this is so, a methodology for evaluating the spatial component in county land use planning should be proposed.The problem and a purpose for this study emerge. In order to confirm the existence of the problem as initially perceived and to determine the planning milieu in which county governments are working, the planning background at the federal government level was examined as was that at the state level. The latter was accomplished through correspondence with planning agencies in each of the fifty states. In order to narrow the field to a manageable dimension, the planning and support documents of three counties in Colorado&apos;s north central area were carefully examined; i.e., those of Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties. Further information was obtained through field observation; visits to and conversations with planners of the three counties plus extensive correspondence. Through the study and investigation involved in this effort, it has been found that most states have provided authority and guidance to their counties to initiate and pursue land use planning. The extent to which counties have undertaken the tasks involved vary widely.This is true even among the three counties making up the study area for this paper. Comprehensive plans reflect to what extent land use pressures are perceived by the residents and officials of a county.They also reveal the degree of control that is to be exercised in managing land use decisions.Not surprisingly, the findings confirm the absence of a procedure to evaluate the spatial component in county land use plans.These findings are significant in that at this late date in the land management affairs of mankind, that management is still quite elemental in relation to the need.With the findings of this study available a methodology was proposed to evaluate the spatial component in county land use plans. The methodology includes a procedure which includes a detailed inventory of present land uses, a cyclic monitoring of the county area, steps which may be taken to rectify misuses, and a suggested means by which the effectiveness of the spatial component in plans may be evaluated. Some important conclusions emerge from this study. Now, late in the nineteenth century, some counties still have inadequate and in¬effective comprehensive plans. Even though some counties may have timely and sophisticated comprehensive plans for land use management, none specifically include a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of any component of the plan.Finally, it is concluded that a new generation of county comprehensive land use plans is needed.The new plans must have as a specific objective woven into the fabric of the plan, the intention to evaluate the effectiveness of the spatial component of the plan, and a procedure whereby that intention can be effectuated.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Basic research on the Arctic fluvial environments has been presented. The arctic fluvial, although comparable in form to fluvial environments outside of the Arctic, is characterized by many unique processes. This is principally due to the fact that continuous permafrost underlies the Arctic Coastal Plain Province of Northern Alaska. Direct observations were made on the soils, permafrost, geomorphic processes, and general characteristics of five sites. The first site is an area of polymorphic ground in wet tundra soils and represents the incipient fluvial environment. The second site is a small drainage basin with an open channel and considerable disturbance by man. The third site was a small basin with essentially no disturbance by man. The fourth site is a large drainage basin with a tortuous channel. The channel is representative of the tributaries in the larger basins in the Province. The principal conclusions are numerous but can be summarized as follows. Low centered polygons can act as reservoirs and prevent runoff. Water assists in thawing ice wedges and forming polygon troughs. The troughs overlying the ice wedges can be part of an integrated drainage system. The degree of soil moisture determines if water will flow off of areas of integrated drainage. Large amounts of rainfall can be accepted immediately by the upland soils, and no surface runoff can occur. Runoff occurs only from the saturated soils which are adjacent to the integrated channels. Chemical and sediment loads are low in basins in tundra covered channels. Man&apos;s activity can trigger and accelerate erosion. There is a general sequence of events, repeated annually, between Spring runoff and Fall freeze-up. The evaporation and transpiration appear to be in balance with precipitation. The discharge and sediment load during the Spring runoff are important in forming and maintaining the present geomorphic form. The material presented is significant because this information has not been available before. The information is needed in light of the expanding resource exploitation already underway in northern Alaska.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A thesis is proposed to show that the availability of repetitive observations from satellites yields information of significant benefit to the study of geography. A specific example of land-use survey of a selected test site is used to test the thesis. Data from the satellite LANDSAT-1, from aircraft at very high and medium altitudes, and from ground survey are used in the test experiment. Validation of the thesis statement requires definition of the terms, &quot;benefit&quot; and &quot;significant.&quot; This is accomplished by reference to published information needs of selected geographers. A set of five needs is extracted: (1) develop new approaches and ways of measuring interrelationships, (2) attempt to study all significant phenomena in an area, (3) include temporal data, (4) study human/nature relationships, and (5) determine areal distributions and pattern associations. The thesis is placed in historical perspective by discussion of the importance of reflective observation in past geographical discoveries. It is shown that the rapid traverse studies which began forty years ago are analogous to observations from spacecraft. Design of the test experiment in land-use survey establishes the rationale of the experiment, selects the test site in Madison County, Alabama, establishes objectives and limitations, and out-line tests to determine if objectives are met. Technical details of factors affecting conduct of the experiment are given. These include resolution limits, data gathering, observation modes, and the land-use classification system. Conduct of the experiment is described, and in the analysis of data a number of maps are produced. Using the maps as information products, the test are applied to show that experimental objectives were met. The results are stated in terms of questions raised by the thesis; the five information needs are each examined relative to the experiment findings, for example. The success of the study in confirmation of the thesis is shown. Important findings, unanswered questions, conclusions, and recommendations complete the report.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The factors of the environment which control hillslope form include: (1) geology, (2) climate, (3) topography, (4) vegetation, (5) soils, and (6) process. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the importance of the climatic factor. Hillslope measurements and climate data were obtained for twenty-eight sites throughout the conterminous United States. Each hillslope selected has a southern exposure, is underlain by nearly horizontal marine shale, is within five miles of a weather station having a minimum record of twenty-one consecutive years including 1951-1971, and is devoid of man-made changes. The parameters developed from the hillslope surveys are: curvature of the convex segment; slope of the straight segment; slope of a regression line fit through the entire concave-convex hillslope profile; slope-length ratio; and departure from an average curve. The climate variables developed from Weather Bureau records were selected on the basis of their relationship to geomorphic processes. The climate variables utilized are: summer precipitation; fall precipitation; winter precipitation; spring precipitation; rainfall intensity; freeze-thaw cycles; thermal intensity; potential evapotranspiration; and water availability. Correlation coefficients from simple regression were used to determine the relationship between each hillslope parameter and each climate variable. Step-wise multiple regression was sued to measure the combined influence of all the climate variables on slope form. The hillslope parameters were divided into climatic groups and subjected to the analyses of variance to determine the possibility of the regionalization of landforms on the basis of climate. The results of the analyses indicate that climate plays an important role in determining hillslope form. Fifty-nine percent of the variations in the rate of curvature of the convex segments can be explained by the climate variables. Approximately 43 percent of the variation in the slop of the straight segments was accounted on the basis of climate. Slightly over 37 percent of the differences in the slope of the fitted regression line were attributable to differences in climate. Nearly 26 percent of the variation in the values of the slope-length ratio can be explained by the climate variables. Fourteen percent of the departure from the average curve was accounted for on the basis of climate. Two attempts to regionalize landforms on the basis of climate were unsuccessful. The elements of climate most important to hillslope form are: (1) potential evapotranspiration, (2) spring precipitation, and (3) water availability. It can be concluded from these results that hillslopes in arid regions generally have smaller radii of curvature of their convex segments, steeper gradients of their straight segments and smaller slope length ratios than those of humid areas. This suggests that stream patterns in arid areas should exhibit higher densities and frequencies than those in humid regions.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Cities are presently considered as huge, confusing and impersonal regions by the majority of urban residents in the United States. However, in our society, people have developed a means of spatial ordering centered about themselves that permits orientation and adjustment to urban living. The average person, in discussing his daily movements, generally refers to the urban area in terms of decreasing certainty and increasing suspicion as he mentally moves outward from his home. Of primary importance to geographers has been the research in perception of the urban area by residents and their resultant “mental” images. This study explored a means of measuring and examining the patterns of urban perception. The secondary objective of this investigation was the exploration of utilizing perception measurements in the city-planning process. Four neighborhoods in Denver, Colorado were chosen for use in the study. Each area encompassed differing formal planning and political units and were given special reference titles. They were: 1) Westside-a predominantly Chicano area located near the Central Business District, 2) Bear valley – an entirely White area in southwest Denver, 3) SE Denver – an almost entirely White area in the south-eastern part of the City and 4) Park Hill- an integrated Black-Anglo area in northeast Denver. Residents in the four neighborhoods were randomly selected and interviewed at home. The interviews conducted housing preference, landmark identification, and mobility. During the interviews respondents were requested to rate eighteen examples of housing by comfort. The results were then sorted according to four parameters: 1) Size, 2) Greenery, 3) Density and 4) Styel. Respondents were also requested to identify four landmarks unique to their neighborhood and twelve sites common to all four areas. Last, each person interviewed was requested to complete a trip matrix indication the frequency with which various regional shopping and recreation sites are visited. The analyses of survey data indicated that although all parameters were used to some degree by each neighborhood in stratifying housing by comfort, the greatest stratification between neighborhoods occurred in the use of Size. According to the sample data, there was a direct relationship between the affluence of a neighborhood and the number of residents who stratified housing preference by Size. The study also found that residents used different landmark symbols in site identification. The symbol choice became more regional in scope with increasing distance from the respondent’s home to the site. Also, in moving about their homes, the residents used one localized site for convenience shopping and about two sites, in different directions from the home, outside the immediate neighborhood for specialized shopping.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The great size of the earth and the many geographical elements upon it require that geographic research utilize a reductionism that demands comprehensive considerations of scale. These elements compose a range of geographical focus within the experience of man, and in keeping with the processes of nature. The geographer has no laboratory in the manner of other scientists, but must rely on the map, and more recently upon remote sensors, as a means of making portions of the landscape amenable for study. These also supplement his field work, which is affected by the dimensions of the landscape, and his limited powers of observation. Geography is a science of areal variation which requires extensive study of area. Man’s perception and conceptualization of area have important implications of scale. In field work, the geographer operates at a scale of reality (1:1). The sources with which he supplements field work are at various scales. Perception and conceptualization are processes, of both physiological and mental nature, peculiar to the individual; but the geographer is a trained individual and can give meaning to the areal variations at appropriately selected scales. Geographers have used the term, scale, with several meanings. Map scale is the most common and best understood. However, there are other scales necessary for the measure of areal variation. In this respect, it is frequently necessary for a special scale to be devised for the individual research problem. Geographers have also employed the term, scale, with the connotation of area, and to refer to a point on a scale. The important thing is that the scale measures what it says that it will measure, and that it is not in violation of the isomorphism between the real objects and the number system. It is also important that subsequent mathematical operations performed upon measured quantities, be in accord with the order of the scale (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio), with which their measure has been determined. In geography, it is clear that the term scale means measurement, and more specifically, the preciseness of measurement. There is also a need to distinguish between generalization and measurement, as the former belongs to hypothesis and theory, and the latter to empirical observation. The selection of scale for a particular geographic research problem, might be thought of as a position of observation within a cone, inverted over the study area (cone of resolution). The choice of scale available is almost infinite, and the geographer has to rely on intuition and experience for selection. Actually he works at multi-scale considerations, being governed by data sources and the nature of his problem. Examination of current research articles reveals that most geographic research is being conducted at small scales (65 percent) while only 6 percent is at large scale. In aerial photo interpretation scale plays an important part in resolution, detection, and identification, but the mechanical systems and physical conditions involved are the governing factors. Thematic and special purpose mapping have extreme scale considerations center around the expression of areal data as point data. This is basically a matter of the extent to which one wishes to conceptualize or think abstractly, but concept cannot continue to be built upon concept without eventual verification with reality.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The distributions of settlements in the Rio Grande Valley of Central New Mexico are studied over the period A.D. 1350 to 1968. The first phase of the investigation is concerned with the historical geography of the settle¬ment changes. Historic records, archaeological evidence, maps and documents are studied to obtain the required information. Settlement maps are then constructed indicating the locations of settlements at various points in time. The quantitative phase of the investigation involves the analysis of the settlement maps. Medvedkov analysis and self-organizing system analysis are employed. Finally the quantitative results and historical geography of the study area are combined for the assessment of settlement pattern changes. While Medvedkov analysis may be useful in some geographic areas, the results of the present study indi¬cate that the method is not universally applicable. To overcome the inadequacies of Medvedkov analysis, the statistical information theory concept of redundancy was tested in the study area and results were compared with samples from outside the area. With empirical modifi¬cation of the Maximum entropy function, the use of redun¬dancy makes possible the measurement of system order in the study area where Medvedkov analysis proved inadequate. It is a natural step to move from the use of redundancy as a static measure of order to the dynamic redundancy rate of change and the associated concept of a self-organizing system. The settlement distributions in this heterogeneous geographical area are characterized by almost continuous change. The fluctuations in the self-organizing system parameter have a sinusoidal character with an average period of approximately 50 years and a non-constant amplitude. There is no indication that a steady or equilibrium condition is attained at any time in the study area. Dacey&apos;s Iowa data was also tested using self-organizing system analysis, and it was found that there were greater settlement distribution fluctuations toward the end of the time sequence than at the beginning. The following factors were noted as being associ¬ated with discernible patterns in the self-organizing system analysis: rapid population increase, steady population loss, spatial expansion and spatial contraction of settlement zone perimeters, out-migration, rural to urban migration, influence of the mission system, and advent of the railroads. Settlement maps and computer program are included in appendixes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This investigation is designed as a study of the recent changes in the locational patterns of commercial activity in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado. Several commercial functions are chosen as being representative of the various &quot;levels&quot; and types of commercial activity. The time period chosen is between the census years 1960 and 1970. The study is placed in a central place framework and a simple definition of centrality is used. Employing an analogy of physical &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;sinks&quot; a central place is said to be an area in which there is an excess of goods or services available to the population in that area. In a similar manner a non-central place is an area in which there is a deficit of goods or services available. By relating the number of facilities of a function to population through a simple formula, the degree of centrality for the function and area can be determined. Using census tracts as the basic unit area centrality indices are computed for ten different functions for both 1960 and 1970. In addition all of the functions are combined to determine a set of overall centrality indices. By comparing indices by tract for both years the changes in centrality occurring during the ten year period are determined. Maps depicting all of the centrality computations as well as the ten year changes are presented and discussed. A considerable change in the locational pattern of commercial activity has occurred between 1960 and 1970. Along with the increasing importance of major outlying planned shopping centers there has been a decrease in the relative importance of major business arterials. The differences between the geographical patterns for &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; order functions are becoming fewer. This appears to be the result of an increasing centralization of commercial activity in several nodal areas spread throughout the urban area. Finally the study has allowed the development of a framework for depicting commercial growth and change. This framework, consisting of five stages, relates changing pat¬terns of commercial activity to population trends and is useful in describing the comprehensive patterns of commercial change in any urban area.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The classical theory that stages in a fluvially-initiated cycle of erosion are marked by similar and well-defined slope configurations has been postulated by William M. Davis and Walther Penck. Lester C. King has offered a third interpretation of hillslope morphology and changes that occur with time. Although this “uniformitarian” approach to cyclical landform development continues to permeate the literature, its verity has been questioned by some students of hillslope evolution. The need for a definitive statement on the nature of valley-side profiles is therefore of fundamental concern to the science of geomorphology. The classical works of Davis, Penck, and King are reviewed in depth to present an unbiased appraisal of the three geomorphic theories. Recent studies on hillslope development are also presented to clarify the problems related to hillslope evolution. Statistical techniques were employed to test the validity of the classical geomorphic theories and are based on mathematical profile curves and regression models. These procedures were used to evaluate over 1,200 slopes selected at random from large-scale topographic maps of the western United States. Since the geomorphic concepts under investigation are theoretical, slope configurations that depict various stages of these cycles can be expressed as mathematical (or theoretical) curves. If it is assumed that the theories of Davis, Penck, and King are valid indicators of slope form throughout a physiographic region, it is then theoretically possible to predict the configurations of large numbers of slopes within the same region. On this basis slopes selected at random from “Test Areas” in the Pacific Mountains, the Intermontane Plateaus, and the Rocky Mountains were mathematically fitted with theoretical profiles representing the “mature” stages of the classical geomorphic theories. Regression equations for each theorist were computed from comparisons of actual and theoretical curves in the Test Areas and then used to predict profiles of randomly selected slopes in sixteen “Prediction Areas.” By statistically comparing the predicted forms with their actual counterparts, the reliability of each geomorphic theory can be tested. If the variance between these two sets of profiles is significantly large, it would be logical to conclude that such a geomorphic system is neither compatible with nor representative of one or more of the physiographic regions. Statistical analyses of the classical slope theories revealed that uniformitarian development is not an entirely valid concept for the western United States. Although results varied considerably among several theorists, the statistical findings were almost wholly negative. Mean deviation values derived from a comparison of actual and predicted declivities rarely dropped below 4 degrees; more often these values were as high as 6 or 7 degrees and even higher. The percentage variances between actual and predicted slopes were also largely negative for the five profile categories (convex, concave, convexo-concave, concavo-convex, and straight). The concavo-convex form was the only statistically significant and, hence, predictable profile. This profile was accurately predicted by King’s multiple-element model in the Pacific Mountains, Intermontane Plateaus, and Rocky Mountains with percentage variances of 1.8, 7.5, and 4.6, respectively. Although King’s multiple-element model was found to be a valid predictor of concavo-convex slopes, the three major profiles (convex, concave, and convexo-concave) were not representative of the Test and Prediction areas. The logical conclusion is that hillslopes are highly variable and reflect the vagaries of the environment; hence hillslopes cannot be categorized on the basis of rigid slope models.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This research examines the influence of geomorphic processes on downstream hydraulic geometry relationships in the northern Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado. Large calibre bed material delivered to stream channels by mass-wasting, past glacial and past glacio-fluvial processes profoundly affect stream dynamics and, therefore, downstream hydraulic geometry relationships.A total of 96 stations are measured: 32 mass-wasting deposits, 32 on till deposits and 32 on outwash deposits. Field measurements include channel cross-section measurements, slope and bed material size and roundness.Derived data include bankfull width, mean depth, mean velocity and discharge, and sorting. Data from topographic maps include elevation, drainage basin area and stream length. Downstream hydraulic geometry relationships are significantly related to bankfull discharge, but not to stream length. Bankfull mean depth has the highest rate of increase with bankfull discharge while bankfull width has the lowest rate of increase. Analysis of bed material at each station suggests the following characteristics. First, sorting and roundness are significantly related to stream length but not to bankfull discharge. Second, particle size is generally significantly stream length. Finally, the coarsest fraction immobile at bankfull stage. Downstream hydraulic geometry relationships are better explained by the addition of a particle size variable. In general, d gs exerts the greatest influence on these relationships. Bankfull width consistently increases with particle size for all groups examined. Bankfull mean depth increases and bankfull mean velocity decreases with particle size for streams flowing over mass-wasting deposits and till deposits. As particle size increases, so does protrusion with flow. Bed material characteristics are significantly different between material generated by mass-wasting, past glacial and past glacio-fluvial processes. Particle size is largest for mass-wasting generated material and smallest for outwash deposits. Outwash deposits are better sorted and more rounded compared to the other two groups. In conclusion, streams in the study area have only limited influence over their channels. Their effectiveness is governed by their competency to entrain large calibre bed material derived from mass-wasting, and past glacial processes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Research presented here examined processes that may influence the disease landscape. This research attempted to determine if there was an association between these processes and disease occurrence that accounts for any residual disease variation after holding the influences of socioeconomics constant. Age-adjusted rates for six indicator diseases-- influenza/pneumonia, heart disease, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, low birthweight, and congenital malformations-- from 1987 through 1991 were aggregated by census tract for the Denver metropolitan area. The influences attributed to socioeconomic status such as income, education, and employment, were held constant and high disease rate tracts were determined. The distances to the nearest hazardous waste site [Superfund National Priority List sites (NPL); Toxic Release Inventory sites (TRI); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Treatment, Storage, and Disposal sites (TSD); and land fills] between high and normal disease rate census tracts were then compared. The distances to the nearest hazardous waste site type between tracts with normal and high disease rates were, overall, not
significantly different. In three cases the distances between normal and high disease rate tracts were found to be significantly different: heart disease and TRI sites, heart disease and NPL sites, and low birthweight and NPL sites. Although the test results were statistically significant, these tracts were not found to be grouped near any
hazardous waste site. Tracts with multiple high disease rates were examined for commonalities, yet none were found. It was hypothesized that socioeconomic status would account for much of the variation in disease frequency, and that any residual variation would be accounted for by proximity to hazardous waste. However, the results of this research indicate that at the aggregate (census tract) level, disease frequency is not associated with distance to hazardous waste facilities or sites. It was also determined that disease frequency was not a linear function of socioeconomic status, but rather, the influences of socioeconomic status on the health of the population were more pronounced for lower social groups.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Seasonal snowfall in New England has exhibited wide variations over the last few decades, the underlying causes of which have not been identified. This research examines how interactions among the large-scale atmospheric circulation and associated sea-level pressure patterns, cyclonic activity and storm track preferences, and North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures contribute to exceptional winter snowfall totals in New England. Unrotated principal components analyses of winter (December-March) precipitation, temperature and snowfall at 27 stations across New England identified regional indices of these variables. Composite anomaly maps of 700-mb heights and sea-level pressure (over North America and adjacent regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) and western Atlantic sea-surface temperatures were generated for extreme-valued winters on each of the regional climate indices. Possible associations between the regional climatic indices and indices of the Pacific-North American (PNA), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Southern Oscillation (SOl) atmospheric patterns were explored by correlation and regression analysis. The climatic, atmospheric, and oceanic data fields were analyzed in a multivariate framework to identify dominant modes of joint variability. Finally, comparisons were made of pairs of winters with similar. seasonal temperature and precipitation, but dissimilar snowfall totals. High winter snowfall totals are associated with a meridional circulation regime, as indicated by a negative NAO index and negative 700-mb height anomalies over the eastern United States. Anomalously high surface pressure over northern Canada promotes advection of cold air into the region, and the preferred storm track is along or just to the south of the New England coast. Low winter snowfall totals are associated with no unique set of circumstances, but a positive NAO index and more zonal circulation is indicated, along with weaker high pressure over Canada, and a storm track over interior New England rather than along the coast. There is no direct association with the PNA index and only a weaklag association with the SOl is indicated. In extreme southern New England, high (low) winter snowfall totals are associated with negative (positive)sea-surface temperature anomalies along the Atlantic seaboard.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The purpose of this research is to examine the fossil pollen and stratigraphic record from Echo Lake and the Doolittle Ranch meadow in order to determine how vegetation in the Mt. Evans region of the Colorado Front
Range has changed since the last glacial advance of the Pleistocene Epoch. This information can then be used to
infer how the regional climate in the Mt. Evans area has changed over the period of record. The study area includes two sites from which sediment cores were extracted for pollen and sediment analyses. These sites are Echo Lake (T4S, R73W, section 31; Idaho Springs quadrangle) and the Doolittle Ranch meadow (T4S, R73W, section 30; Idaho Springs quadrangle). This research chronicles nearly 19,000 years of paleoenvironmental change. Deglaciation in the Colorado Front Range began around 14,000 yr BP. The vegetation of the late-glacial
period was dominated by tundra plants, especially Artemisia. subalpine forests were depressed at least 300
m during this period. The Pleistocene/Holocene transition occurred at about 10,200 yr BP. This is indicated by increase in arboreal pollen percentages with concomitant declines in non-arboreal pollen types, reflecting expansion of coniferous forests at the expense. of tundra. Maximum temperatures occurred between 9000
and 7800 yr BP. Traditionally, palynologists have viewed the middle Holocene (7000 to 4000 yr BP) as the
warmest/driest period of the Holocene. The results presented here suggest that the classic &quot;Altithermal&quot;
warming scenario may not apply in the Colorado Front Range. The onset of Neoglacial cooling began about 4800 yr BP. Modern vegetation distributions were established by 1500 yr BP. Cooler conditions at this time likely
resulted in the development of permafrost in the Echo Lake meadow. The discovery of permafrost in the Echo Lake meadow suggests several interesting implications. Permafrost in subalpine and alpine meadows may have played a significant role in maintaining wet meadows during times of climatic warming in the Holocene. Should hypothetical atmospheric (greenhouse) warming cause degradation of discontinuous mountain permafrost, there could be degradation or loss of subalpine and alpine wetlands in the Rocky Mountains. The loss of subalpine and alpine wetlands could have far-reaching ecological consequence.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The primary concern of this study was to investigate the factors responsible for the rapid emergence and growth of cities in the Ibo Heartland of Nigeria in the years following the end of the civil war in 1970.It was hypothesized that the Ibo Heartland has experienced an unusually rapid rate of urbanization in the post-civil war period. This main hypothesis was tested through the following specific hypotheses: 1. That the rate of urbanization of the Ibo Heartland settlements in the past-civil war period (1970-85) was unique. 2. That Government and private efforts at post-war reconstruction provided impetus for rapid urbanization of Ibo settlements. 3. That intensive community development efforts urbanization of Ibo rural settlements in the post-civil war period stimulated rapid urbanization of Ibo rural settlements. 4. That the return migration of Ibo businesses and persons resulted in the post-war urban phenomenon. 5. That certain Ibo cultural traits aided the urbanization processes. Seven emerging cities within the Ibo Heartland were selected for study. These were compared with fourteen cities of similar status selected from Ibo and Kano regions of Nigeria. Data for the study were collected through primary and secondary sources. Methods of· collecting primary data included use of questionnaires designed for scheduled interviews, oral interviews and field observations. Analyses of these data led to the conclusions that: (1) post-war urbanization in the Ibo Heartland was unique; (2) post-war reconstruction in Nigeria made an indirect contribution to this urbanization; (3) community development efforts provided infrastructures and economic j base for the transformation of Ibo rural settlements into cities; (4) return migration of Ibo businesses and capital propelled their rural settlements to faster growth and urbanization; and (5) Ibo culture was an underlying motivator in the process of transforming Ibo rural settlements into cities. Based on these findings, the researcher recommended among others the: (1) governments should make their impact felt in the development of new cities in Nigeria; (2) viability studies should be carried out before citing high order functions in the rural settlements and; (3) investments in the Ibo Heartland should be more on economic enterprises than mere prestige projects.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This study attempted to provide clarity to the environmental justice debate examining whether or not low-income and, especially, minority persons are disproportionately distributed near hazardous land uses such as CERCLA sites in metropolitan Denver. In the first section, the distribution of CERCLA sites is examined in
relation to selected economic, demographic and land use variables at the census tract level. The second component of the analysis focuses on a stratified random sample of CERCLA sites in relation to housing market variables, namely property values and number of transactions. This analysis resulted in a number of conclusions, some of which are in conflict with the existing literature regarding environmental justice. There is
not a significant difference at the census tract level between tracts containing CERCLA sites and similarly industrial non-CERCLA census tracts. Additionally, tracts adjacent to CERCLA tracts but containing no CERCLA
sites are not significantly different from CERCLA tracts, in terms of either income or minority percentage of the population. Several residential subdivisions were examined to ascertain whether there is a value differential between properties within one-half mile of a selected CERCLA site and other properties, in the same subdivision, outside the one-half mile radius. The results are mixed and it appears that housing value is significantly affected by the proximity of a designated CERCLA site only when the site is well publicized and therefore, is more likely to be seen as hazardous by the local residents. The number of residential property
transactions is not statistically significantly different in CERCLA-influenced subdivisions as compared to contiguous non-CERCLA influenced subdivisions. Nothing contained in this study can clearly refute the supposition that low-income and especially minority persons are disproportionately situated near hazardous land uses. The issue more clearly is, are designated CERCLA sites considered hazardous land uses? Given the distribution of CERCLA sites in metropolitan Denver, and the results of the analysis contained herein, the
conclusion is that most CERCLA sites are not perceived as hazardous and therefore, do not influence demographic, socioeconomic or market pricing variables in any significant manner.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>There has been steady interest in the ideology of equity in schooling practices reflected in the written artifacts of the United States, especially in the last thirty years. However, equality-laden language is often used without definition or critical examination. The assumed meaning of equality terminology is problematic--especially for classroom teachers who are directly held accountable for the practice of equality policy. This inquiry critically evaluates the multiple implications of this common-sense usage of language related to issues of equality, equity, sameness, and even democracy. Using the combined methodologies of educational criticism, critical discourse analysis, and self-ethnography, this transdisciplinary investigation describes, interprets, and evaluates the way staff members in a Head Start/early childhood education organization conceive of, and act upon, conceptualizations of equality policy. A close examination of these conceptualizations can serve to assist educational researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in evaluating the implications equality policies have on the teaching practice as a whole, and by extension, the specific learning lives of students.</dc:description>
