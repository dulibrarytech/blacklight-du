Project title: Blacklight-DU
Local developer: Jeff Rynhart jeff.rynhart@du.edu

The files in this repo are 'patch files'
Must download and configure a Blacklight instance (repo files based on Blacklight 5.2.0)
RVM was utilized to install Blacklight instance; see online documentation on "Install Blacklight RVM" (generic search terms)
Once RVM / Blacklight have been installed and configured, patch the instance with the files from this repo.

Blacklight's core files exist in the .rvm directory, and are edited by placing a core file in the local instance project folder (wherever that might be)
The project folder will contain no files, Blacklight is edited by placing a core file into the main project directory, then editing it there (SEE online docs to further explain this!)
Place the files from this repo into the corresponding folders in the main Blacklight project folder
